(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Carlyle Group L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. Pursuant to a reorganization into a holding partnership structure, the Partnership became a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively," Carlyle Holdings") that the Partnership acquired using proceeds from the Partnership's initial public offering on May 8, 2012. Beginning on May 8, 2012, through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership. On May 2, 2012, our senior Carlyle professionals, the California Public Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS"), and entities affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, the Abu-Dhabi based strategic development and investment company ("Mubadala") contributed all of their interests in the Parent Entities, and our senior Carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged in our business contributed a portion of the equity interests they owned in the general partners of our existing carry funds, to Carlyle Holdings in exchange for an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Carlyle Holdings did not conduct any activity prior to May 2, 2012. As the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements. The historical combined and consolidated financial statements of TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P., as well as their majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Carlyle Group"), reflect the predecessor financial statements of the Partnership, and are based on the historical ownership interests of the senior Carlyle professionals, CalPERS, and Mubadala in Carlyle Group. The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and, for periods prior to May 8, 2012, the financial condition and results of operations of Carlyle Group, the predecessor of the Partnership. Such analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Partnership's final prospectus dated May 2, 2012, included in the Partnership's Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (SEC File No. 333-176685). For ease of reference, we refer to the historical financial results of Carlyle Group as being "our" historical financial results. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we", "us", "our", and "the Partnership" are intended to mean the business and operations of the Partnership since May 8, 2012. When used in the historical context (i.e., prior to May 8, 2012), these terms are intended to mean the business and operations of Carlyle Group. Overview We conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions (formerly referred to as Solutions).   Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 9 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2014, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $65 billion in AUM and approximately $40 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 69 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2014, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $37 billion in AUM and approximately $34 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our nine U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes seven NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2014, our Real Assets segment had approximately $42 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 101 fund of funds vehicles. On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 60% interest in AlpInvest; on August 1, 2013 we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest. On November 1, 2013, we acquired Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC ("Metropolitan"), one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate, which manages 26 fund of funds vehicles. Additionally, on February 3, 2014, we acquired Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ("DGAM"), a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles, which manages 15 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2014, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $51 billion in AUM and approximately $33 billion billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes. Trends Affecting our Business  We believe that on an annual basis, our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. However, our results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds, but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility. These strategies include, but are not limited to, low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies.  During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an 11% increase in the S&P 500 index for the year. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up by 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%. The U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in 2014, with gains of 14% versus the Japanese yen and the Euro and 2% versus the Chinese yuan renminbi. On a trade-weighted basis, the U.S. dollar rose by 9% for 2014. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of U.S. businesses, which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further. While this may pressure the U.S. dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the United States, we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years.  In October 2014, the Federal Reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during 2015, depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year. Despite the expected increase in policy rates, market-based interest rates generally declined in 2014, with the 10-year yield falling from 3% at the end of 2013 to just 1.8% in early 2015. Yields on 10-year German and Japanese government debt fell to 0.48% and 0.27%, respectively, by January 2015. The decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in Japan and the expectation that the European Central Bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of 2015.  Some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include:   Our ability to grow our fee-earning AUM. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised more than $24 billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform. Although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive, our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in 2014 during which several of our larger funds were in the market. If our fundraising levels decline, this decline also will impact our fee-earning AUM. Our fee-earning AUM declined from $140 billion in 2013 to $136 billion in 2014, primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity. During 2015, we expect that much of our fundraising will come from mid-size funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older, larger buyout funds, which may make it difficult to grow fee-earning AUM. In our open-ended funds, to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions, our fee-earning AUM would be adversely impacted. Effective January 1, 2015, we had $2.2 billion net redemptions in our GMS hedge fund operations. Furthermore, from time to time, we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment. As of December 31, 2014, we also had $9.4 billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees. To the extent we fail to grow our fee-earning AUM, our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted.   Our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation. We continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors' evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds, developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors' goals. One area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors, including through the launch of a mutual fund. We utilize both external strategies, including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products, and our internal team of LP relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base. We have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships, further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our LP relations personnel, which could increase our fundraising costs.   Our successful deployment of capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds. Greater competition, high valuations, cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. During 2014, we invested approximately $10 billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds. Over the past five years, we have invested an average of more than $9 billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds. As of December 31, 2014, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $41 billion.   Our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns. The strength of our investment performance affects investors' willingness to commit capital to our funds. The capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our AUM and the management fees we earn. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized proceeds of approximately $20 billion for our carry fund investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased 15% overall during 2014 with a 23% increase in our Corporate Private Equity segment, a 20% increase in our Global Market Strategies segment and a 2% decline in our Real Assets segment. The decline in Real Assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late 2014, but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform. We believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the rising dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation.  Recent Transactions  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 820):  Key Financial Measures  Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ("CP VI"), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2014, were approximately 14% of total management fees recognized . . .

 Carlyle Group L.P. (Form: 424B4, Received: 05/04/2012 17:17:30) 

















	Filed Pursuant to Rule 424 (b)(4)

	Registration No. 333-176685



	PROSPECTUS





	30,500,000 Common
	Units






	Representing Limited Partner
	Interests




	 


	 







	 


	 


	This is the initial public offering of common units representing
	limited partner interests in The Carlyle Group L.P. No public
	market currently exists for our common units. We are offering
	all of the 30,500,000 common units representing limited partner
	interests in this offering. Our common units have been approved
	for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol
	CG.


	 



	Investing in our common units involves risks. See Risk
	Factors beginning on page 27. These risks include the
	following:



	 


	We are managed by our general partner, which is owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals. Our common unitholders will have
	only limited voting rights and will have no right to remove our
	general partner or, except in limited circumstances, elect the
	directors of our general partner. Moreover, immediately
	following this offering, our senior Carlyle professionals
	generally will have sufficient voting power to determine the
	outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of
	our limited partners. In addition, our partnership agreement
	limits the liability of, and reduces or eliminates the duties
	(including fiduciary duties) owed by, our general partner to our
	common unitholders and restricts the remedies available to our
	common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute
	breaches of our general partners duties. As a limited
	partnership, we will qualify for and intend to rely on
	exceptions from certain corporate governance and other
	requirements under the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
	For example, we will not be required to comply with the
	requirements that a majority of the board of directors of our
	general partner consist of independent directors and that we
	have independent director oversight of executive officer
	compensation and director nominations.


	 


	Our business is subject to many risks, including those
	associated with:


	 












	 


	 


	adverse economic and market conditions, which can affect our
	business and liquidity position in many ways, including by
	reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our
	investment funds and reducing the ability of our investment
	funds to raise or deploy capital;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in the debt financing markets, which could negatively
	impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to
	obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments
	and operations, and could increase the cost of such financing if
	it is obtained, leading to lower-yielding investments;




	 




	 


	 


	the potential volatility of our revenue, income and cash flow;




	 




	 


	 


	our dependence on our founders and other key personnel and our
	ability to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees
	who will bring value to our operations;




	 




	 


	 


	business and regulatory impediments to our efforts to expand
	into new investment strategies, markets and businesses;




	 




	 


	 


	the fact that most of our investment funds invest in illiquid,
	long-term investments that are not marketable securities, and
	such investments may lose significant value during an economic
	downturn;




	 




	 


	 


	the potential for poor performance of our investment
	funds; and




	 




	 


	 


	the possibility that we will not be able to continue to raise
	capital from third-party investors on advantageous terms.




	 


	 


	As discussed in Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations, The Carlyle Group L.P. will be treated as
	a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our
	common unitholders therefore will be required to take into
	account their allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and
	deduction of The Carlyle Group L.P. in computing their
	U.S. federal income tax liability. Although we currently
	intend to make annual distributions in an amount sufficient to
	cover the anticipated U.S. federal, state and local income
	tax liabilities of holders of common units in respect of their
	allocable share of our net taxable income, it is possible that
	such tax liabilities will exceed the cash distributions that
	holders of common units receive from us. Although not enacted,
	the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would
	have precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes or required us to hold
	carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations for
	taxable years after a

	ten-year

	transition period and would have taxed individual holders of
	common units with respect to certain income and gains at
	increased rates. Similar legislation could be enacted in the
	future.

	To the extent that the underwriters sell more than 30,500,000

	public offering price less the underwriting discount.


	 


	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other

	representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.


	 


	The underwriters expect to deliver the common units to
	purchasers on or about May 8, 2012.

	Our business has historically been owned by four holding
	entities: TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group
	Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment
	Holdings, L.P. We refer to these four holding entities
	collectively as the Parent Entities. The Parent
	Entities have been under the common ownership and control of our
	senior Carlyle professionals and two strategic investors that
	own minority interests in our business  entities
	affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, an Abu-Dhabi based
	strategic development and investment company
	(Mubadala), and California Public Employees
	Retirement System (CalPERS). Unless the context
	suggests otherwise, references in this prospectus to
	Carlyle, the Company, we,
	us and our refer (1) prior to the
	consummation of our reorganization into a holding partnership
	structure as described under Organizational
	Structure, to

	Carlyle Group

	, which was comprised of
	the Parent Entities and their consolidated subsidiaries and
	(2) after our reorganization into a holding partnership
	structure, to

	The Carlyle Group L.P.

	and its consolidated
	subsidiaries. In addition, certain individuals engaged in our
	businesses own interests in the general partners of our existing
	carry funds. Certain of these individuals have contributed a
	portion of these interests to us as part of the reorganization.
	We refer to these individuals, together with the owners of the
	Parent Entities prior to this offering, collectively as our
	existing owners. Completion of our reorganization
	occurred prior to this offering. See Organizational
	Structure.


	 


	When we refer to the partners of The Carlyle Group
	L.P., we are referring specifically to the common
	unitholders and our general partner and any others who may from
	time to time be partners of that specific Delaware limited
	partnership. When we refer to our senior Carlyle
	professionals, we are referring to the partners of our
	firm who are, together with CalPERS and Mubadala, the owners of
	our Parent Entities prior to the reorganization. References in
	this prospectus to the ownership of the senior Carlyle
	professionals include the ownership of personal planning
	vehicles of these individuals.


	 


	Carlyle funds, our funds and our
	investment funds refer to the investment funds and
	vehicles advised by Carlyle. Our carry funds refers
	to those investment funds that we advise, including the buyout
	funds, growth capital funds, real asset funds and distressed
	debt and mezzanine funds (but excluding our structured credit
	funds, hedge funds and fund of funds vehicles), where we receive
	a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a
	carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns
	are achieved by the fund. Our fund of funds vehicles
	refer to those funds, accounts and vehicles advised by AlpInvest
	Partners B.V., formerly known as AlpInvest Partners N.V.
	(AlpInvest).


	 


	Fee-earning assets under management or
	Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage from
	which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our fee-earning
	AUM generally equals the sum of:


	 


	(a) for carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles
	where the investment period has not expired, the amount of
	limited partner capital commitments and for fund of funds
	vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments
	during the commitment period;


	 


	(b) for substantially all carry funds and certain
	co-investment vehicles where the investment period has expired,
	the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital;


	 


	(c) the gross amount of aggregate collateral balance at
	par, adjusted for defaulted or discounted collateral, of our
	collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and the
	reference portfolio notional amount of our synthetic
	collateralized loan obligations (synthetic CLOs);


	 


	(d) the external investor portion of the net asset value
	(pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit,
	emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic and other hedge
	funds and certain structured credit funds; and


	 


	(e) for fund of funds vehicles and certain carry funds
	where the investment period has expired, the lower of cost or
	fair value of invested capital.




	(iii)








	 






	Assets under management or AUM refers to
	the assets we manage. Our AUM equals the sum of the following:


	 


	(a) the fair value of the capital invested in our carry
	funds, co-investment vehicles and fund of funds vehicles plus
	the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those
	funds and vehicles (including our commitments to those funds and
	vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and
	employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to
	those funds and vehicles;


	 


	(b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance at par of
	our CLOs and the reference portfolio notional amount of our
	synthetic CLOs; and


	 


	(c) the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions)
	of our long/short credit, emerging markets, multi-product
	macroeconomic and other hedge funds and certain structured
	credit funds.


	 


	We include in our calculation of AUM and fee-earning AUM certain
	energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with
	Riverstone Investment Group L.L.C. (Riverstone).


	 


	Our calculations of AUM and fee-earning AUM may differ from the
	calculations of other alternative asset managers. As a result,
	these measures may not be comparable to similar measures
	presented by other alternative asset managers. In addition, our
	calculation of AUM (but not fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled
	commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our
	investment funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of
	whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to
	fees. Our definitions of AUM or fee-earning AUM are not based on
	any definition of AUM or

	fee-earning

	AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment
	funds that we advise. See Business  Structure
	and Operation of Our Investment Funds  Incentive
	Arrangements/Fee Structure.


	 


	For our carry funds, co-investment vehicles and fund of funds
	vehicles, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital
	invested, whereas fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital
	commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost,
	depending on whether the investment period for the fund has
	expired. As such, fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM
	when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is
	less than the cost of those investments.


	 






	 


	Unless indicated otherwise, non-financial operational and
	statistical data in this prospectus is as of December 31,
	2011. Compound annual growth in AUM is presented since
	December 31, 2003, the first period for which comparable
	information is available. The data presented herein that
	provides inception to date performance results of
	our segments relates to the period following the formation of
	the first fund within each segment. For our Corporate Private
	Equity segment, our first fund was formed in 1990. For our Real
	Assets segment, our first fund was formed in 1997.


	 


	Until an investment fund (i) has distributed substantially
	all expected investment proceeds to its fund investors,
	(ii) is not expected to generate further investment
	proceeds (e.g., earn-outs), (iii) is no longer paying
	management fees or accruing performance fees, and (iv) in
	the case of our structured credit funds, has made a final
	redemption distribution, we consider such investment fund to be
	active. The fund performance data presented herein
	includes the performance of all of our carry funds, including
	those that are no longer active. All other fund data presented
	in this prospectus, and all other references to our investment
	funds, are to our active investment funds.


	 


	References herein to active investments are to
	investments that have not yet been fully realized, meaning that
	the investment fund continues to own an interest in, and has not
	yet completely exited, the investment.




	(iv)








	 






	In addition, for purposes of the non-financial operating and
	statistical data included in this prospectus, including the
	aggregation of our

	non-U.S. dollar

	denominated investment funds, foreign currencies have been
	converted to U.S. dollars at the spot rate as of the last
	trading day of the reporting period when presenting period end
	balances, and the average rate for the period has been utilized
	when presenting activity during such period. With respect to
	capital commitments raised in foreign currencies, the conversion
	to U.S. dollars is based on the exchange rate as of the
	date of closing of such capital commitment.


	 


	Unless indicated otherwise, the information included in this
	prospectus assumes no exercise by the underwriters of the option
	to purchase up to an additional 4,575,000 common units from us.

	SUMMARY





	 



	This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in
	this prospectus and does not contain all the information you
	should consider before investing in our common units. You should
	read this entire prospectus carefully, including the section
	entitled Risk Factors and the financial statements
	and the related notes, before you decide to invest in our common
	units.



	 





	The
	Carlyle Group





	 


	We are one of the worlds largest and most diversified
	multi-product global alternative asset management firms. We
	advise an array of specialized investment funds and other
	investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries,
	geographies, asset classes and investment strategies and seek to
	deliver attractive returns for our fund investors. Since our
	firm was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1987, we have grown
	to become a leading global alternative asset manager with
	approximately $147 billion in AUM across 89 funds and
	52 fund of funds vehicles. We have approximately
	1,300 employees, including more than 600 investment
	professionals, in 33 offices across six continents, and we serve
	over 1,400 active carry fund investors from 72 countries.
	Across our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets segments, we
	have investments in over 200 portfolio companies that
	employ more than 650,000 people.


	 





	 


	The growth and development of our firm has been guided by
	several fundamental tenets:


	 












	 


	 



	Excellence in Investing.

	Our primary goal is to invest
	wisely and create value for our fund investors. We strive to
	generate superior investment returns by combining deep industry
	expertise, a global network of local investment teams who can
	leverage extensive firm-wide resources and a consistent and
	disciplined investment process.




	 




	 


	 



	Commitment to our Fund Investors.

	Our fund investors
	come first. This commitment is a core component of our firm
	culture and informs every aspect of our business. We believe
	this philosophy is in the long-term best interests of Carlyle
	and its owners, including our prospective common unitholders.




	 




	 


	 



	Investment in the Firm.

	We have invested, and intend to
	continue to invest, significant resources in hiring and
	retaining a deep talent pool of investment professionals and in
	building the infrastructure of the firm, including our expansive
	local office network and our









	1








	 


















	 




	comprehensive investor support team, which provides finance,
	legal and compliance and tax services in addition to other
	corporate services.




	 












	 


	 



	Expansion of our Platform.

	  We innovate
	continuously to expand our investment capabilities through the
	creation or acquisition of new asset-, sector- and
	regionally-focused strategies in order to provide our fund
	investors a variety of investment options.




	 




	 


	 



	Unified Culture.

	  We seek to leverage the local
	market insights and operational capabilities that we have
	developed across our global platform through a unified culture
	we call One Carlyle. Our culture emphasizes
	collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise across the
	firm to create value.




	 


	We believe that this offering will enable us to continue to
	develop and grow our firm; strengthen our infrastructure; create
	attractive investment products, strategies and funds for the
	benefit of our fund investors; and attract and retain top
	quality professionals. We manage our business for the long-term,
	through economic cycles, leveraging investment and exit
	opportunities in different parts of the world and across asset
	classes. We believe it is an opportune time to capitalize on the
	additional resources and growth prospects that we expect a
	public offering will provide.



	 




	Our
	Business





	 


	We operate our business across four segments: (1) Corporate
	Private Equity, (2) Real Assets, (3) Global Market
	Strategies and (4) Fund of Funds Solutions. We established
	our Fund of Funds Solutions segment on July 1, 2011 at the
	time we completed our acquisition of a 60% equity interest in,
	and began to consolidate, AlpInvest.


	 


	We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements
	with the investment funds that we manage and fees for
	transaction advisory and oversight services provided to
	portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a
	performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an
	incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which
	we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified
	investment returns are achieved by the fund. Our ability to
	generate carried interest is an important element of our
	business and carried interest has historically accounted for a
	significant portion of our revenue. In order to better align the
	interests of our senior Carlyle professionals and the other
	individuals who manage our carry funds with our own interests
	and with those of the investors in these funds, such individuals
	are allocated directly a portion of the carried interest in our
	carry funds. See  Organizational
	Structure  Reorganization for additional
	information regarding the allocation of carried interest between
	us and our senior Carlyle professionals before and after the
	consummation of this offering. See Managements
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations  Key Financial Measures for a
	discussion of the composition of our revenues and expenses,
	including additional information regarding how our management
	fees and performance fees are structured and calculated.


	 


	The following tables set forth information regarding our segment
	revenues, economic net income (ENI) and
	distributable earnings by segment for the years ended
	December 31, 2011 and 2010 and regarding our total
	revenues, income before provision for income taxes and cash
	distributions in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
	accounting principles (GAAP) for such periods.
	Please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Key
	Financial Measures for a discussion of the composition of
	our revenues and expenses and  Segment
	Analysis for discussion and analysis of our segment
	results.

	corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events

	Corporate Private Equity.


	  Our Corporate
	Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with our first
	U.S. buyout fund, advises our buyout and growth capital
	funds, which pursue a wide variety of corporate investments of
	different sizes and growth potentials. Our 26 active Corporate
	Private Equity funds are each carry funds. They are organized
	and operated by geography or industry and are advised by
	separate teams of local professionals who live and work in the
	markets where they invest. We believe this diversity of funds
	allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment
	expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the
	ability to tailor their investment choices.


	 


	Our Corporate Private Equity teams have two primary areas of
	focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Buyout Funds.

	 Our buyout teams advise a diverse
	group of 17 active funds that invest in transactions that focus
	either on a particular geography (United States, Europe, Asia,
	Japan, South America or the Middle East and North Africa
	(MENA)) or a particular industry (e.g., financial
	services). As of December 31, 2011, our buyout funds had,
	in the aggregate, approximately $47 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Growth Capital Funds.

	 Our nine active growth capital
	funds are advised by three

	regionally-focused

	teams in the United States, Europe and Asia, with each team
	generally focused on middle-market and growth companies
	consistent with specific regional investment considerations. As
	of December 31, 2011, our growth capital funds had, in the
	aggregate, approximately $4 billion in AUM.




	 


	The following table presents certain data about our Corporate
	Private Equity segment as of December 31, 2011 (dollar
	amounts in billions; compound annual growth is presented since
	December 31, 2003; amounts invested include co-investments).

	Real Assets.


	  Our Real Assets segment,
	established in 1997 with our first U.S. real estate fund,
	advises our 17 active carry funds focused on real estate,
	infrastructure and energy and renewable resources.


	 


	Our Real Assets teams have three primary areas of focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Real Estate.

	  Our 10 active real estate funds
	pursue real estate investment opportunities in Asia, Europe and
	the United States and generally focus on acquiring
	single-property opportunities rather than large-cap companies
	with real estate portfolios. As of December 31, 2011, our
	real estate funds had, in the aggregate, approximately
	$12 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Infrastructure.

	  Our infrastructure investment
	team focuses on investments in infrastructure companies and
	assets. As of December 31, 2011, we advised one
	infrastructure fund with approximately $1 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Energy & Renewable Resources.

	  Our
	energy and renewable resources activities focus on buyouts,
	growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the
	midstream, upstream, power and oilfield services sectors, as
	well as the renewable and alternative sectors of the energy
	industry. We currently conduct these activities with Riverstone,
	jointly advising six funds with approximately $17 billion
	in AUM as of December 31, 2011. We and Riverstone have
	mutually decided not to pursue additional jointly managed funds
	(although we will continue to advise jointly with Riverstone the
	six existing energy and renewable resources funds). We are
	actively exploring new approaches through which to expand our
	energy capabilities and intend to augment our significant
	in-house expertise in this sector.

	Global Market Strategies.


	  Our Global
	Market Strategies segment, established in 1999 with our first
	high yield fund, advises a group of 46 active funds that pursue
	investment opportunities across various types of credit,
	equities and alternative instruments, and (with regards to
	certain macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities and
	interest rate products and their derivatives. These funds
	include:


	 



	Carry Funds.

	  We advise six carry funds, with
	an aggregate of $3 billion in AUM, in three different
	strategies: distressed and corporate opportunities (including
	liquid trading portfolios and control investments); corporate
	mezzanine (targeting middle market companies); and energy
	mezzanine opportunities (targeting debt investments in energy
	and power projects and companies).


	 



	Hedge Funds.

	  Through our 55% stake in Claren
	Road Asset Management, LLC (Claren Road) we
	advise two long/short credit hedge funds focusing on the global
	high grade and high yield markets totaling, in the aggregate,
	approximately $6 billion in AUM. Additionally, through our
	55% stake in Emerging Sovereign Group LLC (ESG), we
	advise six emerging markets equities and macroeconomic hedge
	funds with an aggregate AUM of $2 billion.


	 



	Structured Credit Funds.

	  Our 32 structured
	credit funds, with an aggregate AUM of $13 billion, invest
	primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through
	structured vehicles and other investment products.


	 


	The following table presents certain data about our Global
	Market Strategies segment as of December 31, 2011 (dollar

	Fund of Funds Solutions.


	  Our Fund of
	Funds Solutions segment was established on July 1, 2011
	when we completed our acquisition of a 60% equity interest in
	AlpInvest. AlpInvest is one of the worlds largest
	investors in private equity and advises a global private equity
	fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary
	activities. Its anchor clients are two large Dutch pension
	funds, which were the founders and previous shareholders of the
	company. Although we maintain ultimate control over AlpInvest,
	AlpInvests historical management team (who are our
	employees) will continue to exercise independent investment
	authority without involvement by other Carlyle personnel.


	 


	AlpInvest has three primary areas of focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Fund Investments.

	  AlpInvest fund of funds
	vehicles make investment commitments directly to buyout, growth
	capital, venture and other alternative asset funds advised by
	other general partners (portfolio funds). As of
	December 31, 2011, AlpInvest advised 25 fund of funds
	vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, approximately
	$30 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Co-investments.

	  AlpInvest invests alongside
	other private equity and mezzanine funds in which it has a fund
	investment throughout Europe, North America and Asia. As of
	December 31, 2011, AlpInvest co-investments programs were
	conducted through 15 fund of funds vehicles totaling, in
	the aggregate, approximately $5 billion in AUM.








	5








	 








	 












	 


	 



	Secondary Investments.

	  AlpInvest also advises
	funds that acquire interests in portfolio funds in secondary
	market transactions. As of December 31, 2011,
	AlpInvests secondary investments program was conducted
	through 12 fund of funds vehicles totaling, in the aggregate,
	approximately $6 billion in AUM.




	 


	In addition, although customized separate accounts and
	co-mingled vehicles for clients other than AlpInvests
	anchor clients do not currently represent a significant portion
	of our AUM, we expect to grow our Fund of Funds Solutions
	segment with these two products. See Business 
	Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds 
	Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure for a discussion of
	the arrangements with the historical owners and management of
	AlpInvest regarding the allocation of carried interest in
	respect of the historical investments of and the historical and
	certain future commitments to our fund of funds vehicles.

	Competitive
	Strengths





	 


	Since our founding in 1987, Carlyle has grown to become one of
	the worlds largest and most diversified multi-product
	global alternative asset management firms. We believe the
	following competitive strengths position us well for future
	growth:


	 




	Global Presence.


	  We believe we have a
	greater presence around the globe and in emerging markets than
	any other alternative asset manager. We currently operate on six
	continents and sponsor funds investing in the United States,
	Asia, Europe, Japan, MENA and South America, with 12 carry funds
	and their related co-investment vehicles representing
	approximately $11 billion in AUM actively investing in
	emerging markets. Our extensive network of investment
	professionals is composed primarily of local individuals with
	the knowledge, experience and relationships that allow them to
	identify and take advantage of opportunities unavailable to
	firms with less extensive footprints.


	 




	Diversified and Scalable Multi-Product
	Platform.


	  We have created separate
	geographic, sector and asset specific fund groups, investing
	significant resources to develop this extensive network of
	investment professionals and offices. As a result, we benefit
	from having 89 different funds (including 49 carry funds) and 52
	fund of funds vehicles around the world. We believe this broad
	fund platform and our investor services infrastructure provide
	us with a scalable foundation to pursue future investment
	opportunities in high-growth markets and to expand into new
	products. Our diverse platform also enhances our resilience to
	credit market turmoil by enabling us to invest during such times
	in assets and geographies that are less dependent on leverage
	than traditional U.S. buyout activity. We believe the
	breadth of our product offerings also enhances our fundraising
	by allowing us to offer investors greater flexibility to
	allocate capital across different geographies, industries and
	components of a companys capital structure.


	 




	Focus on Innovation.


	  We have been at
	the forefront of many recognized trends within our industry,
	including the diversification of investment products and asset
	classes, geographic expansion and raising strategic capital from
	institutional investors. Within 10 years of the launch of
	our first fund in 1990 to pursue buyout opportunities in the
	United States, we had expanded







	6








	 








	our buyout operations to Asia and Europe and added funds focused
	on U.S. real estate, global energy and power, structured
	credit and venture and growth capital opportunities in Asia,
	Europe and the United States. Over the next 10 years, we
	developed an increasing number of new, diverse products,
	including funds focused on distressed opportunities,
	infrastructure, global financial services, mezzanine investments
	and real estate across Asia and Europe. We continued to innovate
	in 2010 and 2011 with the significant expansion of our Global
	Markets Strategies business, which has more than doubled its AUM
	since the beginning of 2008, the formation of our Fund of Funds
	Solutions segment and numerous new fund initiatives. We believe
	our focus on innovation will enable us to continue to identify
	and capitalize on new opportunities in high-growth geographies
	and sectors.


	 




	Proven Ability to Consistently Attract Capital from a
	High-Quality, Loyal Investor Base.


	  Since
	inception, we have raised approximately $117 billion in
	capital (excluding acquisitions). We have successfully and
	repeatedly raised long-term, non-redeemable capital commitments
	to new and successor funds, with a broad and diverse base of
	over 1,400 active carry fund investors from 72 countries.
	Despite the recent challenges in the fundraising markets, from
	December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2011, we had
	closings for commitments totaling approximately $32 billion
	across 30 funds and related co-investment vehicles, as well as
	net inflows to our hedge funds. We have a demonstrated history
	of attracting investors to multiple funds, with approximately
	91% of commitments to our active carry funds (by dollar amount)
	coming from investors who are committed to more than one active
	carry fund, and approximately 58% of commitments to our active
	carry funds (by dollar amount) coming from investors who are
	committed to more than five active carry funds (each as of
	December 31, 2011). We have a dedicated in-house fund
	investor relations function, which we refer to as our LP
	relations group, which includes 23 geographically focused
	investor relations professionals and 31 product and client
	segment specialists and support staff operating on a global
	basis. We believe that our constant dialogue with our fund
	investors and our commitment to providing them with the highest
	quality service inspires loyalty and aids our efforts to
	continue to attract investors across our investment platform.

	Demonstrated Record of Investment
	Performance.


	  We have demonstrated a strong
	and consistent investment track record, producing attractive
	returns for our fund investors across segments, sectors and
	geographies, and across economic cycles. The following table
	summarizes the aggregate investment performance of our Corporate
	Private Equity, Real Assets, and Fund of Funds Solutions
	segments. Due to the diversified nature of the strategies in our
	Global Market Strategies segment, we have included summarized
	investment performance for the largest carry fund and two of our
	largest hedge funds in this segment. For additional information,
	including performance information of other Global Market
	Strategies funds, see Managements Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital represents at least
	85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully
	realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves
	pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when
	considered together with the other investment performance
	metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful
	information regarding our investment performance by removing the
	impact of investments where significant realization activity has
	not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR
	have limitations as measures of investment performance, and
	should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include
	the fact that these measures do not include the performance of
	earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the
	criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will
	have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and
	Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of
	such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR.
	Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross
	IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use
	similarly titled measures.

	indicated on limited partner invested capital based on
	contributions, distributions and unrealized value before
	management fees, expenses and carried interest.

	Net Annualized Return is presented

	Due to the disparate nature of the
	underlying asset classes in which our Global Market Strategies
	funds participate (e.g., syndicated loans, bonds, distressed
	securities, mezzanine loans, emerging markets equities,
	macroeconomic products) and the inherent difficulties in
	aggregating the performance of closed-end and open-end funds,
	the presentation of aggregate investment performance across this
	segment would not be meaningful.





	 




	Financial Strength.


	  The investment
	performance across our broad fund base has enabled us to
	generate Economic Net Income of $833.1 million in 2011 and
	$1.014 billion in 2010 and Distributable Earnings of $864.4
	million and $342.5 million for the same periods. Our income
	before provision for income taxes, a GAAP measure, was
	approximately $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.5 billion in
	2010. This performance is also reflected in the rate of
	appreciation of the investments in our carry funds in recent
	periods, with a 34% increase in our carry fund value in 2010 and
	a 16% increase in 2011. Additionally, distributions to our fund
	investors have been robust, with more than $8 billion
	distributed to fund investors in 2010 and approximately
	$19 billion in 2011. We believe the investment pace and
	available capital of our carry funds position us well for the
	future. Our carry funds invested approximately $10 billion
	in 2010 and more than $11 billion in 2011, and as of
	December 31, 2011, these funds had approximately
	$22 billion in capital commitments that had not yet been
	invested.


	 




	Stable and Diverse Team of Talented Investment
	Professionals With a Strong Alignment of
	Interests


	.  We have a talented team of more
	than 600 investment professionals and we are assisted by our
	Executive Operations Group of 27 operating executives, with an
	average of over 40 years of relevant operating, financial
	and regulatory experience, who are a valuable resource to our
	portfolio companies and our firm. Our investment professionals
	are supported by a centralized investor services and support
	group, which includes more than 400 professionals. The interests
	of our professionals are aligned with the interests of the
	investors in our funds and in our firm. Since our inception
	through December 31, 2011, we and our senior Carlyle
	professionals, operating executives and other professionals have
	invested or committed to invest in excess of $4 billion in
	or alongside our funds. We have also sought to align the
	long-term incentives of our senior Carlyle professionals with
	our common unitholders, including through equity compensation
	arrangements that include certain vesting, minimum retained
	ownership and transfer restrictions. See
	Management  Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership
	Requirements and Transfer Restrictions.


	 




	Commitment to Responsible Global
	Citizenship.


	  We believe that being a good
	corporate citizen is part of good business practice and creates
	long-term value for our fund investors. We have worked to apply
	the Private Equity Growth Capital Councils Guidelines for
	Responsible Investment, which we helped to develop in 2008,
	demonstrating our commitment to environmental, social and
	governance standards in our investment activities. In addition,
	we were the first global alternative asset management firm to
	release a corporate citizenship report, which catalogues and
	describes our corporate citizenship efforts, including our
	responsible investment policy and practices and those of our
	portfolio companies.

	Our
	Strategy for the Future




	 


	We intend to create value for our common unitholders by seeking
	to:


	 












	 


	 


	continue to generate attractive investment returns for our fund
	investors across our multi-fund, multi-product global investment
	platform, including by increasing the value of our current
	portfolio and leveraging the strong capital position of our
	investment funds to pursue new investment opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	continue to inspire the confidence and loyalty of our more than
	1,400 active carry fund investors, and further expand our
	investor base, with a focus on client service and strong
	investment performance;




	 




	 


	 


	continue to grow our AUM by raising follow-on investment funds
	across our four segments and by broadening our platform, through
	both organic growth and selective acquisitions, where we believe
	we can provide investors with differentiated products to meet
	their needs;




	 




	 


	 


	further advance our leadership position in core

	non-U.S. geographic

	markets, including high-growth emerging markets such as China,
	Latin America, India, MENA and

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa; and




	 




	 


	 


	continue to demonstrate principled industry leadership and to be
	a responsible and respected member of the global community by
	demonstrating our commitment to environmental, social and
	governance standards in our investment activities.




	 




	Investment
	Risks




	 


	An investment in our common units involves substantial risks and
	uncertainties. Some of the more significant challenges and risks
	relating to an investment in our common units include those
	associated with:


	 












	 


	 


	adverse economic and market conditions, which can affect our
	business and liquidity position in many ways, including by
	reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our
	investment funds and reducing the ability of our investment
	funds to raise or deploy capital;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in the debt financing markets, which could negatively
	impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to
	obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments
	and operations, and could increase the cost of such financing if
	it is obtained, leading to lower-yielding investments;




	 




	 


	 


	the potential volatility of our revenue, income and cash flow,
	which is influenced by:




	 












	 


	 


	the fact that carried interest is only received when investments
	are realized and achieve a certain specified return;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in the carrying values and performance of our
	funds investments; and




	 




	 


	 


	the life cycle of our carry funds, which influences the timing
	of our accrual and realization of carried interest;




	 




	 


	 


	the fact that the fees we receive for transaction advisory
	services are dependent upon the level of transactional activity
	during the period;




	 












	 


	 


	our dependence on our founders and other key personnel and our
	ability to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees
	who will bring value to our operations;




	 




	 


	 


	business and regulatory impediments to our efforts to expand
	into new investment strategies, markets and businesses;








	10








	 








	 












	 


	 


	the fact that most of our investment funds invest in illiquid,
	long-term investments that are not marketable securities, and
	such investments may lose significant value during an economic
	downturn;




	 




	 


	 


	the potential for poor performance of our investment
	funds; and




	 




	 


	 


	the possibility that we will not be able to continue to raise
	capital from third-party investors on advantageous terms.




	 


	As a limited partnership, we will qualify for and intend to rely
	on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other
	requirements under the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
	For example, we will not be required to comply with the
	requirements that a majority of the board of directors of our
	general partner consist of independent directors and that we
	have independent director oversight of executive officer
	compensation and director nominations.


	 


	In addition, and as discussed in Material
	U.S. Federal Tax Considerations:


	 












	 


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. will be treated as a partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our common
	unitholders therefore will be required to take into account
	their allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and
	deduction of The Carlyle Group L.P. in computing their
	U.S. federal income tax liability;




	 




	 


	 


	Although we currently intend to make annual distributions in an
	amount sufficient to cover the anticipated U.S. federal,
	state and local income tax liabilities of holders of common
	units in respect of their allocable share of our net taxable
	income, it is possible that such tax liabilities will exceed the
	cash distributions that holders of common units receive from
	us; and




	 




	 


	 


	Although not enacted, the U.S. Congress has considered
	legislation that would have precluded us from qualifying as a
	partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
	required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary
	corporations for taxable years after a ten-year transition
	period and would have taxed individual holders of common units
	with respect to certain income and gains now taxed at capital
	gains rates, including gain on disposition of units, at
	increased rates. Similar legislation could be enacted in the
	future.




	 


	Please see Risk Factors for a discussion of these
	and other factors you should consider before making an
	investment in our common units.


	 






	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. was formed in Delaware on July 18,
	2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 1001
	Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.

	Organizational
	Structure





	 




	Our
	Current Organizational Structure




	 


	Our business has historically been owned by four holding
	entities: TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group
	Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment
	Holdings, L.P. We refer to these four holding entities
	collectively as the Parent Entities. The Parent
	Entities have been under the common ownership and control of the
	partners of our firm (who we refer to as our senior
	Carlyle professionals) and two strategic investors that
	own minority interests in our business  entities
	affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, an Abu-Dhabi based
	strategic development and investment company
	(Mubadala), and California Public Employees
	Retirement System (CalPERS). In addition, certain
	individuals engaged in our businesses own interests in the
	general partners of our existing carry funds. Certain of these
	individuals have, as described below, contributed a portion of
	these interests to us as part of the reorganization. We refer to
	these individuals, together with the owners of the Parent
	Entities prior to this offering, collectively, as our
	existing owners.


	 




	Reorganization




	 


	Prior to this offering, we completed a series of transactions
	pursuant to which our business was reorganized into a holding
	partnership structure as described under Organizational
	Structure. Following the reorganization and this offering,
	The Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and, through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, holds equity interests in three
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships (which we refer to collectively as
	Carlyle Holdings), which in turn own the four Parent
	Entities. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The Carlyle
	Group L.P. is the sole general partner of each of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships. Accordingly, The Carlyle Group L.P. will
	operate and control all of the business and affairs of Carlyle
	Holdings and will consolidate the financial results of Carlyle
	Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the ownership
	interest of the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings will be
	reflected as a non-controlling interest in The Carlyle Group
	L.P.s consolidated financial statements. At the time of
	this offering, our existing owners are the only limited partners
	of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships.


	 


	Certain existing and former owners of the Parent Entities
	(including CalPERS and former and current senior Carlyle
	professionals) have beneficial interests in investments in or
	alongside our funds that were funded by such persons indirectly
	through the Parent Entities. In order to minimize the extent of
	third party ownership interests in firm assets, prior to the
	completion of the offering we (i) distributed a portion of
	these interests (approximately $118.5 million as of
	December 31, 2011) to the beneficial owners so that
	they are held directly by such persons and are no longer
	consolidated in our financial statements and
	(ii) restructured the remainder of these interests
	(approximately $84.8 million as of December 31,
	2011) so that they are reflected as non-controlling
	interests in our financial statements. In addition, prior to the
	offering the Parent Entities have restructured the ownership of
	certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior
	Carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will
	be reflected as non-controlling interests in our financial
	statements. Such restructured carried interest rights accounted
	for approximately $42.3 million of our performance fee
	revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Prior to the
	date of the offering the Parent Entities have also made a cash
	distribution of previously undistributed earnings to their
	owners totaling $28.0 million. See Unaudited Pro
	Forma Financial Information.


	 


	Our existing owners then contributed to the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships their interests in the Parent Entities and a
	portion of the equity interests they owned in the general
	partners of our existing investment funds and other entities
	that have invested in or alongside our funds.


	 


	Accordingly, following the reorganization, subsidiaries of
	Carlyle Holdings generally will be entitled to:


	 












	 


	 


	all management fees payable in respect of all current and future
	investment funds that we advise, as well as the fees for
	transaction advisory and oversight services that may be payable









	12








	 


















	 




	by these investment funds portfolio companies (subject to
	certain third party interests, as described below);




	 












	 


	 


	all carried interest earned in respect of all current and future
	carry funds that we advise (subject to certain third party
	interests, including those described below and to the allocation
	to our investment professionals who work in these operations of
	a portion of this carried interest as described below);




	 




	 


	 


	all incentive fees (subject to certain interests in Claren Road
	and ESG and, with respect to other funds earning incentive fees,
	any performance-related allocations to investment
	professionals); and




	 




	 


	 


	all returns on investments of our own balance sheet capital that
	we make following this offering (as well as on existing
	investments with an aggregate value of approximately
	$249.3 million as of December 31, 2011).




	 


	In certain cases, the entities that receive management fees from
	our investment funds are owned by Carlyle together with other
	persons. For example, management fees from our energy and
	renewables funds are received by an entity we own together with
	Riverstone, and the Claren Road, ESG and AlpInvest management
	companies are partially owned by the respective founders and
	managers of these businesses. We may have similar arrangements
	with respect to the ownership of the entities that advise our
	funds in the future.


	 


	In order to better align the interests of our senior Carlyle
	professionals and the other individuals who manage our carry
	funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in
	these funds, such individuals are allocated directly a portion
	of the carried interest in our carry funds. Prior to the
	reorganization, the level of such allocations vary by fund, but
	generally are at least 50% of the carried interests in the fund.
	As a result of the reorganization, the allocations to these
	individuals will be approximately 45% of all carried interest,
	on a blended average basis, earned in respect of investments
	made prior to the date of the reorganization and approximately
	45% of any carried interest that we earn in respect of
	investments made from and after the date of the reorganization,
	in each case with the exception of the Riverstone funds, where
	we will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are
	entitled under our arrangements for those funds. In addition,
	under our arrangements with the historical owners and management
	team of AlpInvest, such persons are allocated all carried
	interest in respect of the historical investments and
	commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of
	December 31, 2010, 85% of the carried interest in respect
	of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the
	period between 2011 and 2020 and 60% of the carried interest in
	respect of all other commitments (including all future
	commitments from third parties). See Business 
	Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds 
	Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure.

	The diagram below (which omits certain wholly-owned intermediate
	holding companies) depicts our organizational structure
	immediately following this offering. As discussed in greater
	detail below and under Organizational Structure, The
	Carlyle Group L.P. will hold, through wholly-owned subsidiaries,
	a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units that is equal to
	the number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has
	issued and will benefit from the income of Carlyle Holdings to
	the extent of its equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships. While the holders of common units of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. will be entitled to all of the economic rights in The
	Carlyle Group L.P. immediately following this offering, our
	existing owners will, like the wholly-owned subsidiaries of The
	Carlyle Group L.P., hold Carlyle Holdings partnership units that
	entitle them to economic rights in Carlyle Holdings to the
	extent of their equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships. Public investors will not directly hold equity
	interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships.


	 





	 


	 




	 













	(1)






	The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	unitholders will have only limited voting rights and will have
	no right to remove our general partner or, except in limited
	circumstances, elect the directors of our general partner. TCG
	Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly-owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals, will hold a special voting unit in
	The Carlyle Group L.P. that will entitle it, on those few
	matters that may be submitted for a vote of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. common unitholders, to participate in the vote on the same
	basis as the common unitholders and provide it with a number of
	votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and
	unvested partnership units in Carlyle Holdings held by the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings on the relevant record
	date. See Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	Partnership Agreement  Withdrawal or Removal of the
	General Partner,  Meetings; Voting
	and  Election of Directors of General
	Partner.





	 





	(2)






	Certain individuals engaged in our
	business will continue to own interests directly in selected
	operating subsidiaries, including, in certain instances,
	entities that receive management fees from funds that we advise.
	The Carlyle Holdings partnerships will also directly own
	interests in selected operating subsidiaries. For additional
	information concerning these interests see Organizational
	Structure  Our Organizational Structure Following
	this Offering  Certain Non-controlling Interests in
	Operating Subsidiaries.

	The Carlyle Group L.P. intends to conduct all of its material
	business activities through Carlyle Holdings. Each of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships was formed to hold our interests
	in different businesses. We expect that Carlyle Holdings I L.P.
	will own all of our U.S. fee-generating businesses and many
	of our

	non-U.S. fee-generating

	businesses, as well as our carried interests (and other
	investment interests) that are expected to derive income that
	would not be qualifying income for purposes of the
	U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules
	and certain of our carried interests (and other investment
	interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of
	corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities
	that are pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	We anticipate that Carlyle Holdings II L.P. will hold a
	variety of assets, including our carried interests in many of
	the investments by our carry funds in entities that are treated
	as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes and in certain

	non-U.S. entities.

	Certain of our

	non-U.S. fee-generating

	businesses, as well as our

	non-U.S. carried

	interests (and other investment interests) that are expected to
	derive income that would not be qualifying income for purposes
	of the U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership
	rules and certain of our

	non-U.S. carried

	interests (and other investment interests) that do not relate to
	investments in stock of corporations or in debt, such as equity
	investments in entities that are pass-through for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes will be held by Carlyle
	Holdings III L.P.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. has formed wholly-owned subsidiaries to
	serve as the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships: Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. (a Delaware corporation
	that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes), Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. (a Delaware
	limited liability company that is a disregarded entity and not
	an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes) and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. (a
	Québec

	société en commandite

	that is a
	foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
	will serve as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P.,
	Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III
	L.P., respectively. Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and Carlyle
	Holdings III GP L.P. will serve as the general partners of
	Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P.,
	respectively, either directly or indirectly through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries that are disregarded for federal income tax
	purposes. We refer to Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., Carlyle
	Holdings II GP L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P.
	collectively as the Carlyle Holdings General
	Partners.


	 




	Holding
	Partnership Structure




	 


	As discussed in Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations, The Carlyle Group L.P. will be treated as
	a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, although our partnership agreement does not
	restrict our ability to take actions that may result in our
	being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. An
	entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no
	U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner is
	required to take into account its allocable share of items of
	income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership in computing
	its U.S. federal income tax liability, whether or not cash
	distributions are made. Investors in this offering will become
	limited partners of The Carlyle Group L.P. Accordingly, an
	investor in this offering generally will be required to pay
	U.S. federal income taxes with respect to the income and
	gain of The Carlyle Group L.P. that is allocated to such
	investor, even if The Carlyle Group L.P. does not make cash
	distributions. We believe that the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	will also be treated as partnerships and not as corporations for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the holders
	of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings, including The Carlyle
	Group L.P.s

	wholly-owned

	subsidiaries, will incur U.S. federal, state and local
	income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable
	income of Carlyle Holdings. See Material U.S. Federal
	Tax Considerations for more information about the tax
	treatment of The Carlyle Group L.P. and Carlyle Holdings.


	 


	Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will have an identical
	number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms
	Carlyle Holdings partnership unit or
	partnership unit in/of Carlyle Holdings to refer
	collectively to a partnership unit in each of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. will hold, through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, a number of







	15








	 








	Carlyle Holdings partnership units equal to the number of common
	units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued. The Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units that will be held by The Carlyle
	Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries will be economically
	identical to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units that will be
	held by our existing owners. Accordingly, the income of Carlyle
	Holdings will benefit The Carlyle Group L.P. to the extent of
	its equity interest in Carlyle Holdings. Immediately following
	this offering, The Carlyle Group L.P. will hold Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units representing 10.0% of the total number of
	partnership units of Carlyle Holdings, or 11.3% if the
	underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units, and our existing owners will hold
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units representing 90.0% of the
	total number of partnership units of Carlyle Holdings, or 88.7%
	if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units.


	 


	Under the terms of the partnership agreements of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships, all of the Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units received by our existing owners in the reorganization
	described in Organizational Structure are subject to
	restrictions on transfer and, with the exception of Mubadala and
	CalPERS, minimum retained ownership requirements. All of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units received by our founders,
	CalPERS and Mubadala as part of the Reorganization are fully
	vested. All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units received
	by our other existing owners in exchange for their interests in
	carried interest owned at the fund level relating to investments
	made by our carry funds prior to the date of the Reorganization
	are fully vested. Of the remaining Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units received as part of the Reorganization by our other
	existing owners, 26.2% are fully vested and 73.8% are not vested
	and, with specified exceptions, are subject to forfeiture if the
	employee ceases to be employed by us prior to vesting. See
	Management  Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership
	Requirements and Transfer Restrictions.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. is managed and operated by our general
	partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., to whom we refer as
	our general partner, which is in turn wholly-owned
	by our senior Carlyle professionals. Our general partner will
	not have any business activities other than managing and
	operating us. We will reimburse our general partner and its
	affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us,
	and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner
	will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. Although
	there are no ceilings on the expenses for which we will
	reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, the expenses
	to which they may be entitled to reimbursement from us, such as
	director fees, are not expected to be material.


	 




	Certain
	Corporate Governance Considerations




	 



	Voting.

	  Unlike the holders of common stock in
	a corporation, our common unitholders will have only limited
	voting rights and will have no right to remove our general
	partner or, except in the limited circumstances described below,
	elect the directors of our general partner. In addition, TCG
	Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly-owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals, will hold a special voting unit
	that provides it with a number of votes on any matter that may
	be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders that is equal
	to the aggregate number of vested and unvested Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units held by the limited partners of Carlyle
	Holdings. Accordingly, immediately following this offering, on
	those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the
	limited partners of The Carlyle Group L.P., such as the approval
	of amendments to the limited partnership agreement of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. that the limited partnership agreement does
	not authorize our general partner to approve without the consent
	of the limited partners and the approval of certain mergers or
	sales of all or substantially all of our assets, investors in
	this offering will collectively have 10.0% of the voting power
	of The Carlyle Group L.P. limited partners, or 11.3% if the
	underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units, and our existing owners will
	collectively have 90.0% of the voting power of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. limited partners, or 88.7% if the underwriters exercise in
	full their option to purchase additional common units. These
	percentages correspond with the percentages of the Carlyle
	Holdings







	16








	 








	partnership units that will be held by The Carlyle Group L.P.
	through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, on the one hand, and by
	our existing owners, on the other hand. We refer to our common
	units (other than those held by any person whom our general
	partner may from time to time with such persons consent
	designate as a non-voting common unitholder) and our special
	voting units as voting units. Our common
	unitholders voting rights will be further restricted by
	the provision in our partnership agreement stating that any
	common units held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more
	of any class of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then
	outstanding (other than our general partner and its affiliates,
	or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general
	partner or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any matter.


	 



	Election of Directors.

	  In general, our common
	unitholders will have no right to elect the directors of our
	general partner. However, when our Senior Carlyle professionals
	and other

	then-current

	or former Carlyle personnel hold less than 10% of the limited
	partner voting power, our common unitholders will have the right
	to vote in the election of the directors of our general partner.
	This voting power condition will be measured on January 31,
	of each year, and will be triggered if the total voting power
	held by holders of the special voting units in The Carlyle Group
	L.P. (including voting units held by our general partner and its
	affiliates) in their capacity as such, or otherwise held by
	then-current or former Carlyle personnel (treating voting units
	deliverable to such persons pursuant to outstanding equity
	awards as being held by them), collectively, constitutes less
	than 10% of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. Unless and until the foregoing voting
	power condition is satisfied, our general partners board
	of directors will be elected in accordance with its limited
	liability company agreement, which provides that directors may
	be appointed and removed by members of our general partner
	holding a majority in interest of the voting power of the
	members, which voting power is allocated to each member ratably
	according to his or her aggregate ownership of our common units
	and partnership units. See Material Provisions of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership Agreement  Election of
	Directors of General Partner.


	 



	Conflicts of Interest and Duties of Our General
	Partner.

	  Although our general partner has no
	business activities other than the management of our business,
	conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our
	common unitholders, on the one hand, and our general partner and
	its affiliates, on the other. The resolution of these conflicts
	may not always be in our best interests or that of our common
	unitholders. In addition, we have certain duties and obligations
	to our investment funds and their investors and we expect to
	regularly take actions with respect to the purchase or sale of
	investments in our investment funds, the structuring of
	investment transactions for those funds or otherwise in a manner
	consistent with such duties and obligations but that might at
	the same time adversely affect our near-term results of
	operations or cash flow.


	 


	Our partnership agreement limits the liability of, and reduces
	or eliminates the duties (including fiduciary duties) owed by,
	our general partner to our common unitholders. Our partnership
	agreement also restricts the remedies available to common
	unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute breaches
	of our general partners duties (including fiduciary
	duties). By purchasing our common units, you are treated as
	having consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership
	agreement, including the provisions regarding conflicts of
	interest situations that, in the absence of such provisions,
	might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under
	applicable state law. For a more detailed description of the
	conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities of our
	general partner, see Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary
	Responsibilities.

	The
	Offering





	 













	Common units offered by The Carlyle Group L.P.





	30,500,000 common units.






	 





	Common units outstanding after the offering transactions





	30,500,000 common units (or 304,500,000 common units
	if all outstanding Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by
	our existing owners were exchanged for newly-issued common units
	on a

	one-for-one

	basis).




	 




	Use of proceeds




	We estimate that the net proceeds to The Carlyle Group L.P. from
	this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts,
	will be approximately $639,127,500 or $734,996,625 if the
	underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units.




	 








	The Carlyle Group L.P. intends to use all of these proceeds to
	purchase newly issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units from
	Carlyle Holdings, as described under Organizational
	Structure  Offering Transactions. We intend to
	cause Carlyle Holdings to use substantially all of these
	proceeds to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under
	the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured
	credit facility. We intend to cause Carlyle Holdings to use any
	proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of their option
	to purchase additional common units from us to repay
	indebtedness under a loan agreement we entered into in
	connection with the acquisition of Claren Road and any remainder
	for general corporate purposes, including general operational
	needs, growth initiatives, acquisitions and strategic
	investments and to fund capital commitments to, and other
	investments in and alongside of, our investment funds. We
	anticipate that the acquisitions we may pursue will be those
	that would broaden our platform where we believe we can provide
	investors with differentiated products to meet their needs.
	Carlyle Holdings will also bear or reimburse The Carlyle Group
	L.P. for all of the expenses of this offering, which we estimate
	will be approximately $19.2 million. See Use of
	Proceeds and Capitalization.




	 




	Voting rights




	Our general partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., will
	manage all of our operations and activities. You will not hold
	an interest in our general partner, which is wholly-owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals. Unlike the holders of common stock
	in a corporation, you will have only limited voting rights and
	will have no right to remove our general partner or, except in
	limited circumstances, elect the directors of our general
	partner.




	 








	In addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity
	wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, will hold a
	special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes on
	any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common
	unitholders that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and
	unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by the limited
	partners of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, immediately following
	this offering our existing owners










	18








	 
























	generally will have sufficient voting power to determine the
	outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of
	the limited partners of The Carlyle Group L.P. Our common
	unitholders voting rights will be further restricted by
	the provision in our partnership agreement stating that any
	common units held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more
	of any class of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then
	outstanding (other than our general partner and its affiliates,
	or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general
	partner or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any matter. See
	Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement  Withdrawal or Removal of the General
	Partner,  Meetings; Voting and
	 Election of Directors of General Partner.




	 




	Cash distribution policy




	Our general partner currently intends to cause The Carlyle Group
	L.P. to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders
	of its share of distributions from Carlyle Holdings, net of
	taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as
	described below. We currently anticipate that we will cause
	Carlyle Holdings to make quarterly distributions to its
	partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly owned
	subsidiaries, that will enable The Carlyle Group L.P. to pay a
	quarterly distribution of $0.16 per common unit, with the first
	such quarterly distribution being ratably reduced to reflect the
	portion of the quarter following the completion of this
	offering. In addition, we currently anticipate that we will
	cause Carlyle Holdings to make annual distributions to its
	partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly owned
	subsidiaries, in an amount that, taken together with the other
	above-described quarterly distributions, represents
	substantially all of our Distributable Earnings in excess of the
	amount determined by our general partner to be necessary or
	appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make
	appropriate investments in our business and our funds or to
	comply with applicable law or any of our financing agreements.
	We anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for
	most years will be less than our Distributable Earnings for that
	year due to these funding requirements. For a discussion of the
	difference between Distributable Earnings and cash distributions
	during the historical periods presented, see Cash
	Distribution Policy.




	 








	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the declaration and payment of
	any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general
	partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time.
	Our general partner will take into account general economic and
	business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our
	business and investment opportunities, our financial condition
	and operating results, working capital requirements and
	anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and
	obligations, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, other
	constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our common
	unitholders or










	19








	 






















	by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our general
	partner may deem relevant.




	 








	The Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and has no
	material assets other than its ownership of partnership units in
	Carlyle Holdings held through

	wholly-owned

	subsidiaries. We intend to cause Carlyle Holdings to make
	distributions to its partners, including the wholly-owned
	subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P., in order to fund any
	distributions we may declare on the common units. If Carlyle
	Holdings makes such distributions, the limited partners of
	Carlyle Holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent
	distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in
	Carlyle Holdings. Because Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. must pay
	taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the
	amounts ultimately distributed by The Carlyle Group L.P. to
	common unitholders are expected to be less, on a per unit basis,
	than the amounts distributed by the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships to the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships in respect of their Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units.




	 










	In addition, the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships provide for cash distributions, which we refer to
	as tax distributions, to the partners of such
	partnerships if our wholly-owned subsidiaries that are the
	general partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships determine
	that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give
	rise to taxable income for its partners. Generally, these tax
	distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net
	taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a
	partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest
	effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income
	tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in
	New York, New York (taking into account the non-deductibility of
	certain expenses and the character of our income). The Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the
	extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant
	year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities.
	The Carlyle Group L.P. is not required to distribute to its
	common unitholders any of the cash that its wholly-owned
	subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions by the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships.




	 








	For limitations on our ability to make distributions, see
	Cash Distribution Policy.




	 





	Exchange rights of holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units





	Prior to this offering we have entered into an exchange
	agreement with our senior Carlyle professionals and the other
	limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships so that
	these holders, subject to the vesting and minimum retained
	ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in
	the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships,
	may on a quarterly basis, from and after the first anniversary
	of










	20








	 
























	the date of the closing of this offering (subject to the terms
	of the exchange agreement), exchange their Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. As the number of Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships declines, the number of votes to which TCG Carlyle
	Global Partners L.L.C. is entitled as a result of its ownership
	of the special voting unit will be correspondingly reduced. For
	information concerning transfer restrictions that will apply to
	holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units, including our
	senior Carlyle professionals, see Management 
	Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer
	Restrictions.




	 




	Tax receivable agreement




	Future exchanges of Carlyle Holdings partnership units are
	expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible
	and intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings, primarily
	attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our
	business. These increases in tax basis will increase (for tax
	purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore
	reduce the amount of tax that certain of our subsidiaries,
	including Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which we refer to as the
	corporate taxpayers, would otherwise be required to
	pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease
	gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain
	capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those
	capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement
	with our existing owners whereby the corporate taxpayers have
	agreed to pay to our existing owners 85% of the amount of cash
	tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax
	that they realize as a result of these increases in tax basis.
	The corporate taxpayers have the right to terminate the tax
	receivable agreement by making payments to our existing owners
	calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that
	our existing owners










	21








	 
























	would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable
	agreement using certain valuation assumptions, including that
	any Carlyle Holdings partnership units that have not been
	exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the
	common units at the time of termination, and that the corporate
	taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income in each future
	taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings. Based
	upon certain assumptions described in greater detail under
	Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Tax Receivable Agreement, we
	estimate that if the corporate taxpayers were to exercise their
	termination right immediately following this offering, the
	aggregate amount of these termination payments would be
	approximately $915.2 million. See Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Tax
	Receivable Agreement.

	Summary
	Financial and Other Data





	 


	The following summary financial and other data of Carlyle Group,
	which comprises TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman L.P., TC Group
	Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment
	Holdings, L.P., as well as their controlled subsidiaries, which
	are under common ownership and control by our individual senior
	Carlyle professionals, entities affiliated with Mubadala and
	CalPERS, should be read together with Organizational
	Structure, Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information, Selected Historical Financial
	Data, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
	historical financial statements and related notes included
	elsewhere in this prospectus. Carlyle Group is considered our
	predecessor for accounting purposes, and its combined and
	consolidated financial statements will be our historical
	financial statements following this offering.


	 


	We derived the summary historical combined and consolidated
	statements of operations data of Carlyle Group for each of the
	years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the
	summary historical combined and consolidated balance sheet data
	as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 from our audited combined
	and consolidated financial statements which are included
	elsewhere in this prospectus. We derived the summary historical
	combined and consolidated balance sheet data of Carlyle Group as
	of December 31, 2009 from our audited combined and
	consolidated financial statements which are not included in this
	prospectus. The combined and consolidated financial statements
	of Carlyle Group have been prepared on substantially the same
	basis for all historical periods presented; however, the
	consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods
	shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms
	and the creation and termination of funds.


	 


	Net income is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for
	partnerships and is not comparable to net income of a
	corporation. All distributions and compensation for services
	rendered by Carlyles individual partners have been
	reflected as distributions from equity rather than compensation
	expense in the historical combined and consolidated financial
	statements. Our

	non-GAAP

	presentation of Economic Net Income and Distributable Earnings
	reflects, among other adjustments, pro forma compensation
	expense for compensation to our senior Carlyle professionals,
	which we have historically accounted for as distributions from
	equity rather than as employee compensation. See
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations  Key Financial
	Measures  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.


	 


	The summary historical combined and consolidated financial and
	other data is not indicative of the expected future operating
	results of The Carlyle Group L.P. following the Reorganization
	and the Offering Transactions (as defined below). Prior to this
	offering, we completed a series of transactions pursuant to
	which our business was reorganized into a holding partnership
	structure as described in Organizational Structure.
	See Organizational Structure and Unaudited Pro
	Forma Financial Information.


	 


	The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of
	operations data for the year ended December 31, 2011
	presents our consolidated results of operations giving pro forma
	effect to the Reorganization and Offering Transactions described
	under Organizational Structure, and the other
	transactions described in Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information, as if such transactions had occurred on
	January 1, 2011. The summary unaudited pro forma
	consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011
	presents our consolidated financial position giving pro forma
	effect to the Reorganization and Offering Transactions described
	under Organizational Structure, and the other
	transactions described in Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information, as if such transactions had occurred on
	December 31, 2011. The pro forma adjustments are based on
	available information and upon assumptions that our management
	believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma
	basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical
	combined and consolidated financial information of Carlyle
	Group. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial
	information is included for informational purposes only and does
	not purport to reflect the results of operations or financial
	position of Carlyle Group that would have occurred had the
	transactions







	24








	 








	described above occurred on the dates indicated or had we
	operated as a public company during the periods presented or for
	any future period or date. The unaudited condensed consolidated
	pro forma financial information should not be relied upon as
	being indicative of our results of operations or financial
	position had the transactions described under
	Organizational Structure and the use of the
	estimated net proceeds from this offering as described under
	Use of Proceeds occurred on the dates assumed. The
	unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information also does
	not project our results of operations or financial position for
	any future period or date.

	RISK
	FACTORS





	 


	An investment in our common units involves risks. You should
	carefully consider the following information about these risks,
	together with the other information contained in this
	prospectus, before investing in our common units.



	 




	Risks
	Related to Our Company





	 





	Adverse
	economic and market conditions could negatively impact our
	business in many ways, including by reducing the value or
	performance of the investments made by our investment funds,
	reducing the ability of our investment funds to raise or deploy
	capital, and impacting our liquidity position, any of which
	could materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely
	affect our financial condition.





	 


	Our business may be materially affected by conditions in the
	global financial markets and economic conditions or events
	throughout the world that are outside of our control, including
	but not limited to changes in interest rates, availability of
	credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws
	(including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity
	prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and
	international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist
	acts or security operations). These factors may affect the level
	and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the
	value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose
	not to manage our exposure to these market conditions

	and/or

	other
	events. In the event of a market downturn, each of our
	businesses could be affected in different ways.


	 


	For example, the unprecedented turmoil in the global financial
	markets during 2008 and 2009 provoked significant volatility of
	securities prices, contraction in the availability of credit and
	the failure of a number of companies, including leading
	financing institutions, and had a significant material adverse
	effect on our Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets and Global
	Market Strategies businesses. During that period, many economies
	around the world, including the U.S. economy, experienced
	significant declines in employment, household wealth and
	lending. In addition, the recent speculation regarding the
	inability of Greece and certain other European countries to pay
	their national debt, the response by Eurozone policy makers to
	mitigate this sovereign debt crisis and the concerns regarding
	the stability of the Eurozone currency have created uncertainty
	in the credit markets. As a result, there has been a strain on
	banks and other financial services participants, which could
	adversely affect our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms
	or at all. Those events led to a significantly diminished
	availability of credit and an increase in the cost of financing.
	The lack of credit in 2008 and 2009 materially hindered the
	initiation of new, large-sized transactions for our Corporate
	Private Equity and Real Assets segments and adversely impacted
	our operating results in those periods. While the adverse
	effects of that period have abated to a degree, global financial
	markets have experienced significant volatility following the
	downgrade by Standard & Poors on August 5,
	2011 of the long-term credit rating of U.S. Treasury debt
	from AAA to AA+. The capital market volatility we are currently
	experiencing that became more pronounced beginning in August
	2011 has continued to impact valuations of a significant number
	of our funds investments and fund performance as of and
	for the year ended December 31, 2011. There continue to be
	signs of economic weakness such as relatively high levels of
	unemployment in major markets including the United States and
	Europe. Further, financial institutions have not yet provided
	debt financing in amounts and on the terms commensurate with
	what they provided prior to 2008.


	 


	Our funds may be affected by reduced opportunities to exit and
	realize value from their investments, by lower than expected
	returns on investments made prior to the deterioration of the
	credit markets and by the fact that we may not be able to find
	suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy
	capital, all of which could adversely affect the timing of new
	funds and our ability to raise new funds. During periods of
	difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across
	one or more industries or geographies), our funds
	portfolio companies may experience adverse operating
	performance, decreased revenues, financial losses, difficulty in
	obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs.
	Negative financial results in our funds portfolio
	companies may result in lower





	27








	 






	investment returns for our investment funds, which could
	materially and adversely affect our ability to raise new funds
	as well as our operating results and cash flow. During such
	periods of weakness, our funds portfolio companies may
	also have difficulty expanding their businesses and operations
	or meeting their debt service obligations or other expenses as
	they become due, including expenses payable to us. Furthermore,
	such negative market conditions could potentially result in a
	portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings, or in the
	case of our Real Assets funds, the abandonment or foreclosure of
	investments, thereby potentially resulting in a complete loss of
	the funds investment in such portfolio company or real
	assets and a significant negative impact to the funds
	performance and consequently our operating results and cash
	flow, as well as to our reputation. In addition, negative market
	conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect
	to investments held by our funds that have significant debt
	investments, such as our Global Market Strategies funds.


	 


	Our operating performance may also be adversely affected by our
	fixed costs and other expenses and the possibility that we would
	be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame
	sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes
	in market and economic conditions. In order to reduce expenses
	in the face of a difficult economic environment, we may need to
	cut back or eliminate the use of certain services or service
	providers, or terminate the employment of a significant number
	of our personnel that, in each case, could be important to our
	business and without which our operating results could be
	adversely affected.


	 


	Finally, during periods of difficult market conditions or
	slowdowns, our fund investment performance could suffer,
	resulting in, for example, the payment of less or no carried
	interest to us. The payment of less or no carried interest could
	cause our cash flow from operations to significantly decrease,
	which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity
	position and the amount of cash we have on hand to conduct our
	operations. Having less cash on hand could in turn require us to
	rely on other sources of cash (such as the capital markets which
	may not be available to us on acceptable terms) to conduct our
	operations, which include, for example, funding significant
	general partner and co-investment commitments to our carry funds
	and fund of funds vehicles. Furthermore, during adverse economic
	and market conditions, we might not be able to renew all or part
	of our credit facility or find alternate financing on
	commercially reasonable terms. As a result, our uses of cash may
	exceed our sources of cash, thereby potentially affecting our
	liquidity position.


	 





	Changes
	in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the
	ability of certain of our funds and their portfolio companies to
	obtain attractive financing or re-financing for their
	investments and could increase the cost of such financing if it
	is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and
	potentially decreasing our net income.





	 


	Any recurrence of the significant contraction in the market for
	debt financing that occurred in 2008 and 2009 or other adverse
	change to us relating to the terms of such debt financing with,
	for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements

	and/or

	more
	restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition
	financings for leveraged buyout and real assets transactions,
	could have a material adverse impact on our business. In the
	event that certain of our funds are unable to obtain committed
	debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain
	debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms,
	certain of our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise
	profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower
	than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to
	a decrease in the investment income earned by us. Similarly, our
	funds portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate
	debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations.
	To the extent that the credit markets render such financing
	difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively
	impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies
	and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In
	addition, to the extent that the markets make it difficult or
	impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term,
	some of our portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt
	at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a
	recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.

	Our
	revenue, net income and cash flow are variable, which may make
	it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a
	quarterly basis.





	 


	Our revenue, net income and cash flow are variable. For example,
	our cash flow fluctuates due to the fact that we receive carried
	interest from our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles only
	when investments are realized and achieve a certain preferred
	return. In addition, transaction fees received by our carry
	funds can vary from quarter to quarter. We may also experience
	fluctuations in our results, including our revenue and net
	income, from quarter to quarter due to a number of other
	factors, including changes in the carrying values and
	performance of our funds investments that can result in
	significant volatility in the carried interest that we have
	accrued (or as to which we have reversed prior accruals) from
	period to period, as well as changes in the amount of
	distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of
	investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to
	which we encounter competition and general economic and market
	conditions. For instance, during the most recent economic
	downturn, we recorded significant reductions in the carrying
	values of many of the investments of the investment funds we
	advise. The carrying value of fund investments may be more
	variable during times of market volatility. Such variability in
	the timing and amount of our accruals and realizations of
	carried interest and transaction fees may lead to volatility in
	the trading price of our common units and cause our results and
	cash flow for a particular period not to be indicative of our
	performance in a future period. We may not achieve steady growth
	in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in
	turn lead to adverse movements in the price of our common units
	or increased volatility in our common unit price generally. The
	timing and receipt of carried interest also varies with the life
	cycle of our carry funds. For instance, the significant
	distributions made by our carry funds during 2010 and 2011 were
	partly a function of the relatively large portion of our AUM
	attributable to carry funds and investments that were in their
	harvesting period during such time, as opposed to
	the fundraising or investment periods which precede harvesting.
	During periods in which a significant portion of our AUM is
	attributable to carry funds and fund of funds vehicles or their
	investments that are not in their harvesting periods, as has
	been the case from time to time, we may receive substantially
	lower distributions. Moreover, even if an investment proves to
	be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be
	realized in cash (or other proceeds). We cannot predict
	precisely when, or if, realizations of investments will occur.
	For example, for an extended period beginning the latter half of
	2007, the global credit crisis made it difficult for potential
	purchasers to secure financing to purchase companies in our
	investment funds portfolio, which limited the number of
	potential realization events. A downturn in the equity markets
	also makes it more difficult to exit investments by selling
	equity securities. If we were to have a realization event in a
	particular quarter, the event may have a significant impact on
	our quarterly results and cash flow for that particular quarter
	which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters.


	 


	We recognize revenue on investments in our investment funds
	based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains
	(or losses) reported by such investment funds, and a decline in
	realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or
	unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue, which
	could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results
	and cash flow. Because our carry funds and fund of funds
	vehicles have preferred investor return thresholds that need to
	be met prior to us receiving any carried interest, declines in,
	or failures to increase sufficiently the carrying value of, the
	investment portfolios of a carry fund or fund of funds vehicle
	may delay or eliminate any carried interest distributions paid
	to us in respect of that fund or vehicle, since the value of the
	assets in the fund or vehicle would need to recover to their
	aggregate cost basis plus the preferred return over time before
	we would be entitled to receive any carried interest from that
	fund or vehicle.


	 


	With respect to certain of the investment funds and vehicles
	that we advise, we are entitled to incentive fees that are paid
	annually, semi-annually or quarterly if the net asset value of a
	fund has increased. These funds also have high-water
	mark provisions whereby if the funds have experienced
	losses in prior periods, we will not be able to earn incentive
	fees with respect to an investors account until the net
	asset value of the investors account exceeds the highest
	period end

	value on which incentive fees were previously paid. The
	incentive fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset
	value of these funds or vehicles, which could lead to volatility
	in our quarterly results and cash flow.


	 


	Our fee revenue may also depend on the pace of investment
	activity in our funds. In many of our carry funds, the base
	management fee may be reduced when the fund has invested
	substantially all of its capital commitments. We may receive a
	lower management fee from such funds after the investing period
	and during the period the fund is harvesting its investments. As
	a result, the variable pace at which many of our carry funds
	invest capital may cause our management fee revenue to vary from
	one quarter to the next. For example, the investment periods for
	many of the large carry funds that we raised during the
	particularly productive period from 2007 to early 2008 will,
	unless extended, begin to expire this year, which will result in
	step-downs in the applicable management fee rates for certain of
	these funds. Our management fee revenues will be reduced by
	these step-downs in management fee rates, as well as by any
	adverse impact on fee-earning AUM resulting from successful
	realization activity in our carry funds. Our failure to
	successfully replace and grow fee-earning AUM through the
	integration of recent acquisitions and anticipated new
	fundraising initiatives could have an adverse effect on our
	management fee revenue.


	 





	We
	depend on our founders and other key personnel, and the loss of
	their services or investor confidence in such personnel could
	have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
	operations and financial condition.





	 


	We depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business
	contacts of our senior Carlyle professionals, including our
	founders, Messrs. Conway, DAniello and Rubenstein,
	and other key personnel, including members of our management
	committee, operating committee, the investment committees of our
	investment funds and senior investment teams, the information
	and deal flow they and others generate during the normal course
	of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields
	of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals.
	Accordingly, our success will depend on the continued service of
	these individuals. Our founders currently have no immediate
	plans to cease providing services to our firm, but our founders
	and other key personnel are not obligated to remain employed
	with us. In addition, all of the Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units received by our founders and a portion of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units that other key personnel have
	received in the reorganization, as described in
	Organizational Structure, are fully vested. Several
	key personnel have left the firm in the past and others may do
	so in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that the
	departure of any key personnel will have on our ability to
	achieve our investment objectives. The loss of the services of
	any of them could have a material adverse effect on our
	revenues, net income and cash flow and could harm our ability to
	maintain or grow AUM in existing funds or raise additional funds
	in the future. Under the provisions of the partnership
	agreements governing most of our carry funds, the departure of
	various key Carlyle personnel could, under certain
	circumstances, relieve fund investors of their capital
	commitments to those funds, if such an event is not cured to the
	satisfaction of the relevant fund investors within a certain
	amount of time. We have historically relied in part on the
	interests of these professionals in the investment funds
	carried interest and incentive fees to discourage them from
	leaving the firm. However, to the extent our investment funds
	perform poorly, thereby reducing the potential for carried
	interest and incentive fees, their interests in carried interest
	and incentive fees become less valuable to them and may become a
	less effective retention tool.


	 


	Our senior Carlyle professionals and other key personnel possess
	substantial experience and expertise and have strong business
	relationships with investors in our funds and other members of
	the business community. As a result, the loss of these personnel
	could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds
	and members of the business community and result in the
	reduction of AUM or fewer investment opportunities. For example,
	if any of our senior Carlyle professionals were to join or form
	a competing firm, that could have a material adverse effect on
	our business, results of operations and financial condition.




	30








	 









	Recruiting
	and retaining professionals may be more difficult in the future,
	which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
	and financial condition.





	 


	Our most important asset is our people, and our continued
	success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior and
	other professionals. Our future success and growth depends to a
	substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our
	senior Carlyle professionals and other key personnel and to
	strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented
	personnel, including new senior Carlyle professionals. However,
	we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit, retain and
	motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified
	investment professionals is extremely competitive.


	 


	Following this offering, we may not be able to provide future
	senior Carlyle professionals with equity interests in our
	business to the same extent or with the same economic and tax
	consequences as those from which our existing senior Carlyle
	professionals previously benefited. For example, following this
	offering, our investment professionals and other employees are
	expected to be incentivized by the receipt of partnership units
	in Carlyle Holdings, deferred restricted common units granted
	pursuant to our equity plans, participation interests in carried
	interest and bonus compensation. The portion of their economic
	incentives comprising Carlyle Holdings partnership units and
	grants of restricted units will be greater after the offering
	than before the offering, and these incentives have different
	economic and tax characteristics than the blend of financial
	incentives we used before the offering.


	 


	If legislation were to be enacted by the U.S. Congress or
	any state or local governments to treat carried interest as
	ordinary income rather than as capital gain for tax purposes,
	such legislation would materially increase the amount of taxes
	that we and possibly our unitholders would be required to pay,
	thereby adversely affecting our ability to recruit, retain and
	motivate our current and future professionals. See
	 Risks Related to
	U.S. Taxation Our structure involves complex
	provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no
	clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure
	also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or
	administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on
	a retroactive basis and  Although not
	enacted, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that
	would have: (i) in some cases after a ten-year transition
	period, precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried
	interest through taxable subsidiary corporations; and
	(ii) taxed certain income and gains at increased rates. If
	any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the
	after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as
	our distributions to you and the market price of our common
	units, could be reduced. Moreover, the value of the common
	units we may issue our senior Carlyle professionals at any given
	time may subsequently fall (as reflected in the market price of
	our common units), which could counteract the intended
	incentives.


	 


	As a result of the foregoing, in order to recruit and retain
	existing and future senior Carlyle professionals and other key
	personnel, we may need to increase the level of compensation
	that we pay to them. Accordingly, as we promote or hire new
	senior Carlyle professionals and other key personnel over time
	or attempt to retain the services of certain of our key
	personnel, we may increase the level of compensation we pay to
	these individuals, which could cause our total employee
	compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total
	revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability. The
	issuance of equity interests in our business in the future to
	our senior Carlyle professionals and other personnel would also
	dilute public common unitholders.


	 


	We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our
	culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests
	with investors. If we do not continue to develop and implement
	the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise
	and maintain this culture, our ability to compete successfully
	and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which
	could negatively impact our business, results of operations and
	financial condition.




	31








	 









	Given
	the priority we afford the interests of our fund investors and
	our focus on achieving superior investment performance, we may
	reduce our AUM, restrain its growth, reduce our fees or
	otherwise alter the terms under which we do business when we
	deem it in the best interest of our fund investors 
	even in circumstances where such actions might be contrary to
	the interests of unitholders.





	 


	In pursuing the interests of our fund investors, we may take
	actions that could reduce the profits we could otherwise realize
	in the short term. While we believe that our commitment to our
	fund investors and our discipline in this regard is in the
	long-term interest of us and our common unitholders, our common
	unitholders should understand this approach may have an adverse
	impact on our short-term profitability, and there is no
	guarantee that it will be beneficial in the long term. One of
	the means by which we seek to achieve superior investment
	performance in each of our strategies might include limiting the
	AUM in our strategies to an amount that we believe can be
	invested appropriately in accordance with our investment
	philosophy and current or anticipated economic and market
	conditions. For instance, in 2009 we released JPY
	50 billion ($542 million) of co-investment commitments
	associated with our second Japan buyout fund (CJP II) in
	exchange for an extension of the funds investment period.
	In prioritizing the interests of our fund investors, we may also
	take other actions that could adversely impact our short-term
	results of operations when we deem such action appropriate. For
	example, in 2009, we decided to shut down one of our Real Assets
	funds and guaranteed to reimburse investors of the fund for
	capital contributions made for investments and fees to the
	extent investment proceeds did not cover such amounts.
	Additionally, we may voluntarily reduce management fee rates and
	terms for certain of our funds or strategies when we deem it
	appropriate, even when doing so may reduce our short-term
	revenue. For example, in 2009, we voluntarily increased the
	transaction fee rebate for our latest U.S. buyout fund
	(CP V) and our latest European buyout fund (CEP III)
	from 65% to 80%, and voluntarily reduced CEP III management fees
	by 20% for the years 2011 and 2012. We have also waived
	management fees on certain leveraged finance vehicles at various
	times to improve returns.


	 





	We may
	not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies,
	markets and businesses, which could adversely affect our
	business, results of operations and financial
	condition.





	 


	Our growth strategy is based, in part, on the expansion of our
	platform through selective investment in, and development or
	acquisition of, alternative asset management businesses or other
	businesses complementary to our business. This strategy can
	range from smaller-sized lift-outs of investment teams to
	strategic alliances or acquisitions. This growth strategy
	involves a number of risks, including the risk that the expected
	synergies from an acquisition or strategic alliance will not be
	realized, that the expected results will not be achieved or that
	the investment process, controls and procedures that we have
	developed around our existing platform will prove insufficient
	or inadequate in the new investment strategy. We may also incur
	significant charges in connection with such acquisitions and
	investments and they may also potentially result in significant
	losses and costs. For instance, in 2007, we made an investment
	in a multi-strategy hedge fund joint venture, which we
	liquidated at a significant loss in 2008 amid deteriorating
	market conditions and global financial turmoil. Similarly, in
	2006, we established an investment fund, which invested
	primarily in U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities.
	Beginning in March 2008, there was an unprecedented
	deterioration in the market for U.S. agency mortgage backed
	securities and the fund was forced to enter liquidation,
	resulting in a recorded loss for us of approximately
	$152 million. Such losses could adversely impact our
	business, results of operations and financial condition, as well
	as do harm to our professional reputation.


	 


	The success of our growth strategy will depend on, among other
	things:


	 












	 


	 


	the availability of suitable opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	the level of competition from other companies that may have
	greater financial resources;




	 




	 


	 


	our ability to value potential development or acquisition
	opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for
	those opportunities;






	32








	 






	 












	 


	 


	our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the
	relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable
	laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and
	delays; and




	 




	 


	 


	our ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial
	arrangements with our counterparties.




	 


	Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully
	negotiate and complete an acquisition, these types of
	transactions can be complex and we may encounter unexpected
	difficulties or incur unexpected costs including:


	 












	 


	 


	the diversion of managements attention to integration
	matters;




	 




	 


	 


	difficulties and costs associated with the integration of
	operations and systems;




	 




	 


	 


	difficulties and costs associated with the assimilation of
	employees; and




	 




	 


	 


	the risk that a change in ownership will negatively impact the
	relationship between an acquiree and the investors in its
	investment vehicles.




	 


	Each transaction may also present additional unique challenges.
	For example, our investment in AlpInvest faces the risk that the
	other asset managers in whose funds AlpInvest invests may no
	longer be willing to provide AlpInvest with investment
	opportunities as favorable as in the past, if at all.


	 





	Our
	organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into
	new lines of business, and we may, from time to time, expand
	into new investment strategies, geographic markets and
	businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and
	uncertainties in our businesses.





	 


	We intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to seek
	to grow our businesses and expand into new investment
	strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Moreover, our
	organizational documents do not limit us to the asset management
	business. To the extent that we make strategic investments or
	acquisitions in new geographic markets or businesses, undertake
	other related strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of
	business, we may face numerous risks and uncertainties,
	including risks associated with the following:


	 












	 


	 


	the required investment of capital and other resources;




	 




	 


	 


	the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in
	such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate
	amounts of risk;




	 




	 


	 


	the combination or integration of operational and management
	systems and controls; and




	 




	 


	 


	the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks
	associated with conducting operations in certain foreign
	jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.




	 


	Further, entry into certain lines of business may subject us to
	new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar or from
	which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased
	litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates
	insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage
	our expanded operations, our results of operations may be
	adversely affected.


	 


	Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, which may
	subject us to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may
	be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or
	reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel
	that are not under our control. We currently participate in
	several joint ventures and may elect to participate in
	additional joint venture opportunities in the future if we
	believe that operating in such a structure is in our best
	interests. There can be no assurances that our current joint
	ventures will continue in their current form, or at all, in the
	future or that we will be able to identify acceptable joint
	venture partners in the future or that our participation in any
	additional joint venture opportunities will be successful.

	Although
	not enacted, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that
	would have: (i) in some cases after a ten-year transition
	period, precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried
	interest through taxable subsidiary corporations; and
	(ii) taxed certain income and gains at increased rates. If
	any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the
	after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as
	our distributions to you and the market price of our common
	units, could be reduced.





	 


	Over the past several years, a number of legislative and
	administrative proposals have been introduced and, in certain
	cases, have been passed by the U.S. House of
	Representatives. In May 2010, the U.S. House of
	Representatives passed legislation, or May 2010 House
	bill, that would have, in general, treated income and
	gains now treated as capital gains, including gain on
	disposition of interests, attributable to an investment services
	partnership interest (ISPI) as income subject to a
	new blended tax rate that is higher than the capital gains rate
	applicable to such income under current law, except to the
	extent such ISPI would have been considered under the
	legislation to be a qualified capital interest. Your interest in
	us, our interest in Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and the
	interests that Carlyle Holdings II L.P. holds in entities
	that are entitled to receive carried interest may have been
	classified as ISPIs for purposes of this legislation. The
	U.S. Senate considered but did not pass similar
	legislation. Recently, on February 14, 2012, Representative
	Levin introduced similar legislation, or 2012 Levin
	bill, that would generally tax carried interest at
	ordinary income rates. Unlike previous proposals, the 2012 Levin
	bill includes exceptions, including exceptions for interests in
	publicly traded partnerships like The Carlyle Group L.P., that
	would appear to not recharacterize all of the gain from a
	disposition of units as ordinary income. It is unclear when or
	whether the U.S. Congress will vote on this legislation or
	what provisions will be included in any legislation, if enacted.


	 


	Both the May 2010 House bill and the 2012 Levin bill
	provide that, for taxable years beginning 10 years after
	the date of enactment, income derived with respect to an ISPI
	that is not a qualified capital interest and that is subject to
	the rules discussed above would not meet the qualifying income
	requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules.
	Therefore, if similar legislation is enacted, following such
	ten-year period, we would be precluded from qualifying as a
	partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or be
	required to hold all such ISPIs through corporations, possibly
	U.S. corporations. If we were taxed as a
	U.S. corporation or required to hold all ISPIs through
	corporations, our effective tax rate would increase
	significantly. The federal statutory rate for corporations is
	currently 35%. In addition, we could be subject to increased
	state and local taxes. Furthermore, you could be subject to tax
	on our conversion into a corporation or any restructuring
	required in order for us to hold our ISPIs through a corporation.


	 


	On September 12, 2011, the Obama administration submitted
	similar legislation to Congress in the American Jobs Act that
	would tax income and gain, now treated as capital gains,
	including gain on disposition of interests, attributable to an
	ISPI at rates higher than the capital gains rate applicable to
	such income under current law, except to the extent such ISPI
	would be considered to be a qualified capital interest. The
	proposed legislation would also characterize certain income and
	gain in respect of ISPIs as non-qualifying income under the
	publicly traded partnership rules after a

	ten-year

	transition period from the effective date, with an exception for
	certain qualified capital interests. This proposed legislation
	follows several prior statements by the Obama administration in
	support of changing the taxation of carried interest.
	Furthermore, in its published revenue proposal for 2013, the
	Obama administration proposed that current law regarding the
	treatment of carried interest be changed to subject such income
	to ordinary income tax (which is taxed at a higher rate than the
	proposed blended tax rate under the House legislation). The
	Obama administrations published revenue proposals for
	2010, 2011 and 2012 contained similar proposals.


	 


	More recently, on February 22, 2012, the Obama
	administration announced its framework of key
	elements to change the U.S. federal income tax rules for
	businesses. Few specifics were included, and it is unclear what
	any actual legislation would provide, when it would be proposed
	or what its prospects for enactment would be. Several parts of
	the framework if enacted could adversely affect





	34








	 






	us. First, the framework would reduce the deductibility of
	interest for corporations in some manner not specified. A
	reduction in interest deductions could increase our tax rate and
	thereby reduce cash available for distribution to investors or
	for other uses by us. Such a reduction could also increase the
	effective cost of financing by companies in which we invest,
	which could reduce the value of our carried interest in respect
	of such companies. The framework suggests some entities
	currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes should be
	subject to an entity-level income tax similar to the corporate
	income tax. If such a proposal caused us to be subject to
	additional entity-level taxes, it could reduce cash available
	for distribution to investors or for other uses by us. Finally,
	the framework reiterates the Presidents support for
	treatment of carried interest as ordinary income, as provided in
	the Presidents revenue proposal for 2013 described above.
	Because the framework did not include specifics, its effect on
	us is unclear, but the framework reflects a commitment by the
	President to try to change the tax law in ways that could be
	adverse to us.


	 


	States and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation
	to increase taxes with respect to carried interest. For example,
	New York considered legislation under which you, even if a
	non-resident, could be subject to New York state income tax on
	income in respect of our common units as a result of certain
	activities of our affiliates in New York. This legislation would
	have been retroactive to January 1, 2010. It is unclear
	when or whether similar legislation will be enacted. In
	addition, states and other jurisdictions have considered
	legislation to increase taxes involving other aspects of our
	structure. In addition, states and other jurisdictions have
	considered and enacted legislation which could increase taxes
	imposed on our income and gain. For example, the District of
	Columbia has recently passed legislation that could expand the
	portion of our income that could be subject to District of
	Columbia income tax.


	 





	We
	will expend significant financial and other resources to comply
	with the requirements of being a public entity.





	 


	As a public entity, we will be subject to the reporting
	requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
	(the Exchange Act), and requirements of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act).
	These requirements may place a strain on our systems and
	resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual,
	quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and
	financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we
	maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal controls over financial reporting, which is discussed
	below. See  Our internal controls over
	financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards
	contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and
	failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over
	financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our
	business and common unit price. In order to maintain and
	improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
	procedures, significant resources and management oversight will
	be required. We will be implementing additional procedures and
	processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and
	requirements applicable to public companies. These activities
	may divert managements attention from other business
	concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
	flows. We expect to incur significant additional annual expenses
	related to these steps and, among other things, additional
	directors and officers liability insurance, director fees,
	reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the SEC), transfer agent fees, hiring additional
	accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased
	auditing and legal fees and similar expenses.


	 





	Our
	internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet
	all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain
	effective internal controls over financial reporting in
	accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could
	have a material adverse effect on our business and common unit
	price.





	 


	We have not previously been required to comply with the
	requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the internal
	control evaluation and certification requirements of
	Section 404 of that





	35








	 






	statute (Section 404), and we will not be
	required to comply with all of those requirements until we have
	been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
	for a specified period of time. Accordingly, our internal
	controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of
	the standards contemplated by Section 404 that we will
	eventually be required to meet. We are in the process of
	addressing our internal controls over financial reporting and
	are establishing formal policies, processes and practices
	related to financial reporting and to the identification of key
	financial reporting risks, assessment of their potential impact
	and linkage of those risks to specific areas and activities
	within our organization.


	 


	Additionally, we have begun the process of documenting our
	internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of
	Section 404, which requires annual management assessments
	of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
	reporting and a report by our independent registered public
	accounting firm addressing these assessments. Because we do not
	currently have comprehensive documentation of our internal
	controls and have not yet tested our internal controls in
	accordance with Section 404, we cannot conclude in
	accordance with Section 404 that we do not have a material
	weakness in our internal controls or a combination of
	significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion
	that we have a material weakness in our internal controls. As a
	public entity, we will be required to complete our initial
	assessment in a timely manner. If we are not able to implement
	the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with
	adequate compliance, our operations, financial reporting or
	financial results could be adversely affected, and our
	independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to
	certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over
	financial reporting. Matters impacting our internal controls may
	cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a
	timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory
	consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of
	applicable stock exchange listing rules, and result in a breach
	of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our
	financing arrangements. There could also be a negative reaction
	in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in
	us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence
	in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer
	if our independent registered public accounting firm were to
	report a material weakness in our internal controls over
	financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us
	and lead to a decline in our common unit price.


	 





	Operational
	risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our
	growth.





	 


	We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, information and
	other data processing systems. If any of these systems do not
	operate properly or are disabled or if there is any unauthorized
	disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach
	of our network security systems, a cyber incident or attack or
	otherwise, we could suffer substantial financial loss, increased
	costs, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds
	and fund investors regulatory intervention or reputational
	damage. In addition, we operate in businesses that are highly
	dependent on information systems and technology. Our information
	systems and technology may not continue to be able to
	accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems
	may increase from its current level. Such a failure to
	accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such
	information systems, could have a material adverse effect on us.


	 


	Furthermore, we depend on our headquarters in
	Washington, D.C., where most of our administrative and
	operations personnel are located, and our office in Arlington,
	Virginia, which houses our treasury and finance functions, for
	the continued operation of our business. A disaster or a
	disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses,
	including a disruption involving electronic communications or
	other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct
	business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a
	material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate
	our business without interruption. Our disaster recovery
	programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may
	result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition,
	insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us
	for our losses, if at all.




	36








	 






	In addition, sustaining our growth will also require us to
	commit additional management, operational and financial
	resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to
	maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to
	adequately support expansion. Due to the fact that the market
	for hiring talented professionals is competitive, we may not be
	able to grow at the pace we desire.


	 





	Extensive
	regulation in the United States and abroad affects our
	activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities
	and penalties.





	 


	Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including
	periodic examinations, by governmental agencies and
	self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we
	operate around the world. Many of these regulators are empowered
	to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that
	can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other
	sanctions, including censure, the issuance of

	cease-and-desist

	orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or
	investment adviser from registration or memberships. Even if an
	investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the
	sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were
	small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the
	investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could
	harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing fund investors
	or fail to gain new investors or discourage others from doing
	business with us. Some of our investment funds invest in
	businesses that operate in highly regulated industries,
	including in businesses that are regulated by the
	U.S. Federal Communications Commission and
	U.S. federal and state banking authorities. The regulatory
	regimes to which such businesses are subject may, among other
	things, condition our funds ability to invest in those
	businesses upon the satisfaction of applicable ownership
	restrictions or qualification requirements. Moreover, our
	failure to obtain or maintain any regulatory approvals necessary
	for our funds to invest in such industries may disqualify our
	funds from participating in certain investments or require our
	funds to divest themselves of certain assets. In addition, we
	regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
	Act), the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act of
	1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), and the
	U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
	amended (ERISA), in conducting our asset management
	activities in the United States. Similarly, in conducting our
	asset management activities outside the United States, we rely
	on available exemptions from the regulatory regimes of various
	foreign jurisdictions. These exemptions from regulation within
	the United States and abroad are sometimes highly complex and
	may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third
	parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these
	exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become
	subject to regulatory action or third-party claims and our
	business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover,
	the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed
	primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and
	to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to
	protect our common unitholders. Consequently, these regulations
	often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome
	compliance requirements. See Business 
	Regulatory and Compliance Matters.


	 


	We may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance
	burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment
	platform. For example, if we were to sponsor a registered
	investment company under the 1940 Act, such registered
	investment company and our subsidiary that serves as its
	investment adviser would be subject to the 1940 Act and the
	rules thereunder, which, among other things, regulate the
	relationship between a registered investment company and its
	investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal
	transactions and joint transactions. This could increase our
	compliance costs and create the potential for additional
	liabilities and penalties.


	 





	Regulatory
	changes in the United States could adversely affect our business
	and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result
	in additional burdens and expenses on our
	business.





	 


	As a result of the financial crisis and highly publicized
	financial scandals, investors have exhibited concerns over the
	integrity of the U.S. financial markets and the domestic
	regulatory environment in which we operate in the United States.
	There has been an active debate over the





	37








	 






	appropriate extent of regulation and oversight of private
	investment funds and their managers. We may be adversely
	affected as a result of new or revised legislation or
	regulations imposed by the SEC or other U.S. governmental
	regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that
	supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely
	affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of
	existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and
	self-regulatory organizations. Regulatory focus on our industry
	is likely to intensify if, as has happened from time to time,
	the alternative asset management industry falls into disfavor in
	popular opinion or with state and federal legislators, as the
	result of negative publicity or otherwise.


	 


	On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
	Dodd-Frank Act), which imposes significant new
	regulations on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial
	services industry, including aspects of our business. Among
	other things, the Dodd-Frank Act includes the following
	provisions, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to
	conduct our business:


	 












	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act establishes the Financial Stability Oversight
	Council (the FSOC), an interagency body acting as
	the financial systems systemic risk regulator with the
	authority to review the activities of nonbank financial
	companies predominantly engaged in financial activities that are
	designated as systemically important. Such
	designation is applicable to companies where material financial
	distress could pose risk to the financial stability of the
	United States or if the nature, scope, size, scale,
	concentration, interconnectedness or mix of their activities
	could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. On
	April 3, 2012, the FSOC issued a final rule and
	interpretive guidance regarding the process by which it will
	designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important.
	The final rule and interpretive guidance detail a three-stage
	process, with the level of scrutiny increasing at each stage.
	During Stage 1, the FSOC will apply a broad set of uniform
	quantitative metrics to screen out financial companies that do
	not warrant additional review. The FSOC will consider whether a
	company has at least $50 billion in total consolidated
	assets and whether it meets other thresholds relating to credit
	default swaps outstanding, derivative liabilities, total debt
	outstanding, a threshold leverage ratio of total consolidated
	assets (excluding separate accounts) to total equity of 15 to 1,
	and a short-term debt ratio of debt (with maturities of less
	than 12 months) to total consolidated assets (excluding
	separate accounts) of 10%. A company that meets or exceeds both
	the asset threshold and one of the other thresholds will be
	subject to additional review. Although it is unlikely that we
	would be designated as systemically important under the process
	outlined in the final rule and interpretive guidance, the
	designation criteria could, and is expected to, evolve over
	time. While the FSOC will use the Stage 1 thresholds in
	identifying nonbank financial companies for further evaluation,
	it may initially evaluate any nonbank financial company based on
	other firm-specific quantitative or qualitative factors,
	irrespective of whether such company meets the thresholds in
	Stage 1. If the FSOC were to determine that we were a
	systemically important nonbank financial company, we would be
	subject to a heightened degree of regulation, which could
	include a requirement to adopt heightened standards relating to
	capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, credit exposure
	reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions
	and being subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.




	 




	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act, under what has become known as the
	Volcker Rule, generally prohibits depository
	institution holding companies (including foreign banks with
	U.S. branches and insurance companies with U.S. depository
	institution subsidiaries), insured depository institutions and
	subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities from investing in
	or sponsoring private equity funds or hedge funds. The Volcker
	Rule will become effective on July 21, 2012 and is subject
	to certain transition periods and exceptions for certain
	permitted activities that would enable certain
	institutions subject to the Volcker Rule to continue investing
	in private equity funds under certain conditions. Although we do
	not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely
	affect our fundraising to any significant extent, there is
	uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and
	its practical







	38








	 
















	 




	implications and there could be adverse implications on our
	ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned
	above as a result of this prohibition. On October 11, 2011, the
	Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies issued a
	proposed rule implementing the Volcker Rule; a final rule may
	not be issued until after the effective date.




	 












	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act requires many private equity and hedge fund
	advisers to register with the SEC under the Advisers Act, to
	maintain extensive records and to file reports with information
	that the regulators identify as necessary for monitoring
	systemic risk. Although a Carlyle subsidiary has been registered
	as an investment adviser for over 15 years, the Dodd-Frank
	Act will affect our business and operations, including
	increasing regulatory costs, imposing additional burdens on our
	staff and potentially requiring the disclosure of sensitive
	information.




	 




	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to
	review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements
	at financial institutions that give employees incentives to
	engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking
	by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit
	our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and
	senior management executives.




	 




	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to adopt and
	disclose policies requiring, in the event the company is
	required to issue an accounting restatement, the clawback of
	related incentive compensation from current and former executive
	officers.




	 




	 


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to compensate and
	protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original
	information to the SEC and establishes a fund to be used to pay
	whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal
	to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in
	a successful government action resulting from the information
	provided by the whistleblower.




	 


	Many of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and
	to the discretion of regulatory bodies, such as the FSOC and the
	Federal Reserve.


	 


	In June 2010, the SEC approved

	Rule 206(4)-5

	under the Advisers Act regarding pay to play
	practices by investment advisers involving campaign
	contributions and other payments to government clients and
	elected officials able to exert influence on such clients. The
	rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory
	services for compensation to a government client for two years,
	subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment
	adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in
	soliciting investments from government entities make
	contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to
	influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government
	client. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies
	designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain
	of the advisers employees and engagement of third parties
	that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in
	order to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule.
	Any failure on our part to comply with the rule could expose us
	to significant penalties and reputational damage. In addition,
	there have been similar rules on a

	state-level

	regarding pay to play practices by investment
	advisers. For example, in May 2009, we reached resolution with
	the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the
	NYAG) regarding its inquiry into the use of
	placement agents by various asset managers, including Carlyle,
	to solicit New York public pension funds for private equity and
	hedge fund investment commitments. We made a $20 million
	payment to New York State as part of this resolution in November
	2009 and agreed to adopt the NYAGs Code of Conduct.


	 


	In September 2010, California enacted legislation, which became
	effective in January 2011, requiring placement agents who
	solicit funds from the California state retirement systems, such
	as CalPERS and the California State Teachers Retirement
	System, to register as lobbyists. In addition to increased
	reporting requirements, the legislation prohibits placement
	agents from receiving contingent compensation for soliciting
	investments from California state retirement systems. New York
	City has enacted similar measures, which became effective on
	January 1, 2011, that require asset management firms and
	their employees that solicit investments from New York
	Citys five public pension systems





	39








	 






	to register as lobbyists. Like the California legislation, the
	New York City measures impose significant compliance obligations
	on registered lobbyists and their employers, including annual
	registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal
	recordkeeping, and also prohibit the acceptance of contingent
	fees. Moreover, other states or municipalities may consider
	similar legislation as that enacted in California and New York
	City or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect.
	These types of measures could materially and adversely impact
	our business.


	 


	It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact on us of
	the Dodd-Frank Act or any other new laws, regulations or
	initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals
	will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework
	applicable to our business, including the changes described
	above, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention
	of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner
	in which we conduct our business. Moreover, as calls for
	additional regulation have increased, there may be a related
	increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other
	investment activities of alternative asset management funds,
	including our funds. Compliance with any new laws or regulations
	could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the
	manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our
	profitability.


	 





	Recent
	regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States
	could adversely affect our business.





	 


	Similar to the environment in the United States, the current
	environment in jurisdictions outside the United States in which
	we operate, in particular Europe, has become subject to further
	regulation. Governmental regulators and other authorities in
	Europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and
	additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our
	business.


	 


	In October 2010, the EU Council of Ministers adopted a directive
	to amend the revised Capital Requirements Directive (CRD
	III), which, among other things, requires European Union
	(EU) member states to introduce stricter control on
	remuneration of key employees and risk takers within specific
	credit institutions and investment firms. The Financial Services
	Authority (the FSA) has implemented CRD III by
	amending its remuneration code although the extent of the
	regulatory impact will differ depending on a firms size
	and the nature of its activities.


	 


	In addition, in November 2010, the European Parliament voted to
	approve the EU Directive on Alternative Investment
	Fund Managers (the EU Directive), which
	establishes a new EU regulatory regime for alternative
	investment fund managers, including private equity and hedge
	fund managers. The EU Directive generally applies to managers
	with a registered office in the EU (or managing an EU-based fund
	vehicle), as well as non-EU-based managers that market
	securities of alternative investment funds in the European
	Union. In general, the EU Directive will have a staged
	implementation over a period of years beginning in mid-2013 for
	EU-based managers (or EU-based funds) and no later than 2018 for
	non-EU-based managers marketing non-EU-based funds into the
	European Union. Compliance with the EU Directive will subject us
	to a number of additional requirements, including rules relating
	to the remuneration of certain personnel (principally adopting
	the provisions of CRD III referred to above), certain capital
	requirements for alternative investment fund managers, leverage
	oversight for each investment fund, liquidity management and
	retention of depositories for each investment fund. Compliance
	with the requirements of the EU Directive will impose additional
	compliance expense for us and could reduce our operating
	flexibility and fund raising opportunities.


	 


	In December 2011, Chinas National Development and Reform
	Commission issued a new circular regulating the activities of
	private equity funds established in China. The circular includes
	new rules relating to the establishment, fundraising and
	investment scope of such funds; risk control mechanisms; basic
	responsibilities and duties of fund managers; information
	disclosure systems; and record filing. Compliance with these
	requirements may impose additional expense, affect the manner in
	which we conduct our business and adversely affect our
	profitability.


	 


	Our investment businesses are subject to the risk that similar
	measures might be introduced in other countries in which our
	funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the
	future, or that





	40








	 






	other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect
	their respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in
	any of the countries in which they invest. The reporting related
	to such initiatives may divert the attention of our personnel
	and the management teams of our portfolio companies. Moreover,
	sensitive business information relating to us or our portfolio
	companies could be publicly released.


	 


	See Risks Related to Our Business Operations 
	Our funds make investments in companies that are based outside
	of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks
	not typically associated with investments in companies that are
	based in the United States and
	Busin

	e

	ss  Regulatory and Compliance
	Matters for more information.


	 





	We are
	subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant
	liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a
	result of litigation allegations and negative
	publicity.





	 


	The investment decisions we make in our asset management
	business and the activities of our investment professionals on
	behalf of portfolio companies of our carry funds may subject
	them and us to the risk of third-party litigation arising from
	investor dissatisfaction with the performance of those
	investment funds, the activities of our portfolio companies and
	a variety of other litigation claims and regulatory inquiries
	and actions. From time to time we and our portfolio companies
	have been and may be subject to regulatory actions and
	shareholder class action suits relating to transactions in which
	we have agreed to acquire public companies.


	 


	For example, on February 14, 2008, a private class action
	lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged
	anti-competitive business practices was filed in the
	U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The
	complaint alleges, among other things, that certain private
	equity firms, including Carlyle, violated Section 1 of the
	Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (the Sherman Act) by
	forming multi-sponsor consortiums for the purpose of bidding
	collectively in corporate buyout auctions in certain going
	private transactions, which the plaintiffs allege constitutes a
	conspiracy in restraint of trade. It is difficult to
	determine what impact, if any, this litigation (and any future
	related litigation), together with any increased governmental
	scrutiny or regulatory initiatives, will have on the private
	equity industry generally or on us and our funds specifically.
	As a result, the foregoing could have an adverse impact on us or
	otherwise impede our ability to effectively achieve our asset
	management objectives. See Business  Legal
	Proceedings for more information on this and other
	proceedings.


	 


	In addition, to the extent that investors in our investment
	funds suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence,
	willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may
	have remedies against us, our investment funds, our principals
	or our affiliates under the federal securities laws

	and/or

	state
	law. The general partners and investment advisers to our
	investment funds, including their directors, officers, other
	employees and affiliates, are generally indemnified with respect
	to their conduct in connection with the management of the
	business and affairs of our private equity funds. For example,
	we have agreed to indemnify directors and officers of Carlyle
	Capital Corporation Limited in connection with the matters
	involving that fund discussed under Business 
	Legal Proceedings. However, such indemnity generally does
	not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud, gross
	negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct.


	 


	If any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a
	finding of substantial legal liability, the lawsuit could
	materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
	or financial condition or cause significant reputational harm to
	us, which could materially impact our business. We depend to a
	large extent on our business relationships and our reputation
	for integrity and

	high-caliber

	professional services to attract and retain investors and to
	pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result,
	allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or
	regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or
	unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press
	speculation about us, our investment activities or the private
	equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our
	reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to
	other types of businesses.




	41








	 






	In addition, with a workforce composed of many highly paid
	professionals, we face the risk of litigation relating to claims
	for compensation, which may, individually or in the aggregate,
	be significant in amount. The cost of settling any such claims
	could negatively impact our business, results of operations and
	financial condition.


	 





	Employee
	misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and
	retain investors in our funds and subjecting us to significant
	legal liability and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive
	practices or other misconduct at our portfolio companies could
	harm performance.





	 


	There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct
	that adversely affects our business. Our ability to attract and
	retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our
	funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals,
	especially our senior Carlyle professionals. We are subject to a
	number of obligations and standards arising from our asset
	management business and our authority over the assets managed by
	our asset management business. The violation of these
	obligations and standards by any of our employees would
	adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires
	that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to
	companies in which our funds may invest. If our employees were
	to use or disclose confidential information improperly, we could
	suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and
	current and future business relationships, as well as face
	potentially significant litigation. It is not always possible to
	detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive
	precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not
	be effective in all cases. If any of our employees were to
	engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct,
	whether or not substantiated, our business and our reputation
	could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence
	could result, which would adversely impact our ability to raise
	future funds.


	 


	We will also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by
	senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds
	invest. Such misconduct might undermine our due diligence
	efforts with respect to such companies and it might negatively
	affect the valuation of a funds investments.


	 


	In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice (the
	DOJ) and the SEC have devoted greater resources to
	enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the
	FCPA). In addition, the United Kingdom has recently
	significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. While
	we have developed and implemented policies and procedures
	designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel
	with the FCPA, such policies and procedures may not be effective
	in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that
	we have violated the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption
	laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal
	penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on
	future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of
	investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our
	business prospects, financial position or the market value of
	our common units.


	 





	Certain
	policies and procedures implemented to mitigate potential
	conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory
	requirements may reduce the synergies across our various
	businesses and inhibit our ability to maintain our collaborative
	culture.





	 


	We consider our One Carlyle philosophy and the
	ability of our professionals to communicate and collaborate
	across funds, industries and geographies one of our significant
	competitive strengths. As a result of the expansion of our
	platform into various lines of business in the alternative asset
	management industry we are currently, and as we continue to
	develop our managed account business and expand we will be,
	subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of
	interest and subject to greater regulatory oversight than that
	to which we would otherwise be subject if we had just one line
	of business. In addition, as we expand our platform, the
	allocation of investment opportunities among our investment
	funds may become more complex. In addressing these conflicts and
	regulatory requirements across our various businesses, we have
	and may continue to implement certain policies and procedures
	(for example, information barriers) that may reduce the positive
	synergies that we cultivate across these businesses through our
	One





	42








	 






	Carlyle approach. For example, although we maintain
	ultimate control over AlpInvest, AlpInvests historical
	management team (who are our employees) will continue to
	exercise independent investment authority without involvement by
	other Carlyle personnel. See  Risks Related to
	Our Business Operations  Our Fund of Funds Solutions
	business is subject to additional risks. In addition, we
	may come into possession of material

	non-public

	information with respect to issuers in which we may be
	considering making an investment. As a consequence, we may be
	precluded from providing such information or other ideas to our
	other businesses that benefit from such information.



	 




	Risks
	Related to Our Business Operations





	 





	Poor
	performance of our investment funds would cause a decline in our
	revenue, income and cash flow, may obligate us to repay carried
	interest previously paid to us, and could adversely affect our
	ability to raise capital for future investment
	funds.





	 


	In the event that any of our investment funds were to perform
	poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow could decline. In some
	of our funds, such as our hedge funds, a reduction in the value
	of our AUM in such funds could result in a reduction in
	management fees and incentive fees we earn. In other funds
	managed by us, such as our private equity funds, a reduction in
	the value of the portfolio investments held in such funds could
	result in a reduction in the carried interest we earn. Moreover,
	we could experience losses on our investments of our own capital
	as a result of poor investment performance by our investment
	funds. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later
	investments in a carry funds or fund of funds
	vehicles life, the fund does not achieve certain
	investment returns for the fund over its life, we will be
	obligated to repay the amount by which carried interest that was
	previously distributed to us exceeds the amount to which we are
	ultimately entitled. These repayment obligations may be related
	to amounts previously distributed to our senior Carlyle
	professionals prior to the completion of this offering, with
	respect to which our common unitholders did not receive any
	benefit. See  We may need to pay
	giveback obligations if and when they are triggered
	under the governing agreements with our investors.


	 


	Poor performance of our investment funds could make it more
	difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in carry funds
	and fund of funds vehicles might decline to invest in future
	investment funds we raise and investors in hedge funds or other
	investment funds might withdraw their investments as a result of
	the poor performance of the investment funds in which they are
	invested. Investors and potential investors in our funds
	continually assess our investment funds performance, and
	our ability to raise capital for existing and future investment
	funds and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our
	investment funds continued satisfactory performance.
	Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment
	in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our
	funds and ultimately, our management fee income. Alternatively,
	in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand
	lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which
	would likewise decrease our revenue.


	 





	Our
	asset management business depends in large part on our ability
	to raise capital from

	third-party

	investors. If we are unable to raise capital from third-party
	investors, we would be unable to collect management fees or
	deploy their capital into investments and potentially collect
	transaction fees or carried interest, which would materially
	reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our
	financial condition.





	 


	Our ability to raise capital from third-party investors depends
	on a number of factors, including certain factors that are
	outside our control. Certain factors, such as the performance of
	the stock market, the pace of distributions from our funds and
	from the funds of other asset managers or the asset allocation
	rules or regulations or investment policies to which such
	third-party investors are subject, could inhibit or restrict the
	ability of third-party investors to make investments in our
	investment funds. For example, during 2008 and 2009, many
	third-party investors that invest in alternative assets and have
	historically invested in our investment funds experienced
	significant volatility in valuations of their





	43








	 






	investment portfolios, including a significant decline in the
	value of their overall private equity, real assets, venture
	capital and hedge fund portfolios, which affected our ability to
	raise capital from them. Coupled with a lack of distributions
	from their existing private equity and real assets portfolios,
	many of these investors were left with disproportionately
	outsized remaining commitments to, and invested capital in, a
	number of investment funds, which significantly limited their
	ability to make new commitments to third-party managed
	investment funds such as those advised by us. Although economic
	conditions have improved and many investors have increased the
	amount of commitments they are making to alternative investment
	funds, there can be no assurance that this will continue.
	Moreover, as some existing investors cease or significantly
	curtail making commitments to alternative investment funds, we
	may need to identify and attract new investors in order to
	maintain or increase the size of our investment funds. There can
	be no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from
	those new investors. Our ability to raise new funds could
	similarly be hampered if the general appeal of private equity
	and alternative investments were to decline. An investment in a
	limited partner interest in a private equity fund is more
	illiquid and the returns on such investment may be more volatile
	than an investment in securities for which there is a more
	active and transparent market. Private equity and alternative
	investments could fall into disfavor as a result of concerns
	about liquidity and short-term performance. Such concerns could
	be exhibited, in particular, by public pension funds, which have
	historically been among the largest investors in alternative
	assets. Many public pensions are significantly underfunded and
	their funding problems have been exacerbated by the recent
	economic downturn. Concerns with liquidity could cause such
	public pension funds to reevaluate the appropriateness of
	alternative investments. In addition, the evolving preferences
	of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the
	traditional investment fund structure, such as managed accounts,
	smaller funds and co-investment vehicles, become a larger part
	of our business going forward. This could increase our cost of
	raising capital at the scale we have historically achieved.


	 


	The failure to successfully raise capital commitments to new
	investment funds may also expose us to credit risk in respect of
	financing that we may provide such funds. When existing capital
	commitments to a new investment fund are insufficient to fund in
	full a new investment funds participation in a
	transaction, we may lend money to or borrow money from financial
	institutions on behalf of such investment funds to bridge this
	difference and repay this financing with capital from subsequent
	investors to the fund. Our inability to identify and secure
	capital commitments from new investors to these funds may expose
	us to losses (in the case of money that we lend directly to such
	funds) or adversely impact our ability to repay such borrowings
	or otherwise have an adverse impact on our liquidity position.
	Finally, if we seek to expand into other business lines, we may
	also be unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital to
	adequately support such businesses.


	 


	The failure of our investment funds to raise capital in
	sufficient amounts could result in a decrease in our AUM as well
	as management fee and transaction fee revenue, or could result
	in a decline in the rate of growth of our AUM and management fee
	and transaction fee revenue, any of which could have a material
	adverse impact on our revenues and financial condition. Our past
	experience with growth of AUM provides no assurance with respect
	to the future. For example, our next generation of large buyout
	and other funds could be smaller in overall size than our
	current large buyout and other funds. There can be no assurance
	that any of our business segments will continue to experience
	growth in AUM.


	 


	Some of our fund investors may have concerns about the prospect
	of our becoming a publicly traded company, including concerns
	that as a public company we will shift our focus from the
	interests of our fund investors to those of our common
	unitholders. Some of our fund investors may believe that we will
	strive for near-term profit instead of superior risk-adjusted
	returns for our fund investors over time or grow our AUM for the
	purpose of generating additional management fees without regard
	to whether we believe there are sufficient investment
	opportunities to effectively deploy the additional capital.
	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our
	efforts to address such concerns or to convince fund investors
	that our decision to pursue this offering will not affect our
	longstanding priorities or the way we conduct our business. A
	decision by a significant number of our fund investors not to
	commit additional





	44








	 






	capital to our funds or to cease doing business with us
	altogether could inhibit our ability to achieve our investment
	objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our
	business and financial condition.


	 





	Our
	investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower
	management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may
	be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which
	could adversely affect our revenues.





	 


	In connection with raising new funds or securing additional
	investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds
	and investments with existing and potential investors. The
	outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to
	terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of
	prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors.
	Such terms could restrict our ability to raise investment funds
	with investment objectives or strategies that compete with
	existing funds, reduce fee revenues we earn, reduce the
	percentage of profits on

	third-party

	capital that we share in or add expenses and obligations for us
	in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities, all
	of which could ultimately reduce our profitability. For
	instance, we have confronted and expect to continue to confront
	requests from a variety of investors and groups representing
	investors to increase the percentage of transaction fees we
	share with our investors (or to decline to receive any
	transaction fees from portfolio companies owned by our funds).
	To the extent we accommodate such requests, it would result in a
	decrease in the amount of fee revenue we earn. Moreover, certain
	institutional investors have publicly criticized certain fund
	fee and expense structures, including management fees. We have
	confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a
	variety of investors and groups representing investors to
	decrease fees and to modify our carried interest and incentive
	fee structures, which could result in a reduction in or delay in
	the timing of receipt of the fees and carried interest and
	incentive fees we earn. Any modification of our existing fee or
	carry arrangements or the fee or carry structures for new
	investment funds could adversely affect our results of
	operations. See  The alternative asset
	management business is intensely competitive.


	 


	In addition, we believe that certain institutional investors,
	including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, could
	in the future demonstrate an increased preference for
	alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such
	as managed accounts, smaller funds and co-investment vehicles.
	There can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as
	efficient as the traditional investment fund structure, or as to
	the impact such a trend could have on the cost of our operations
	or profitability if we were to implement these alternative
	investment structures. Moreover, certain institutional investors
	are demonstrating a preference to in-source their own investment
	professionals and to make direct investments in alternative
	assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like
	us. Such institutional investors may become our competitors and
	could cease to be our clients.


	 





	Valuation
	methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve
	subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established
	pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could
	result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued
	performance fees.





	 


	There are often no readily ascertainable market prices for a
	substantial majority of illiquid investments of our investment
	funds. We determine the fair value of the investments of each of
	our investment funds at least quarterly based on the fair value
	guidelines set forth by generally accepted accounting principles
	in the United States. The fair value measurement accounting
	guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that
	ranks the observability of market inputs used in measuring
	financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs
	is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of
	financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the
	financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including
	the existence and transparency of transactions between market
	participants. Financial instruments with readily quoted prices,
	or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in
	active markets, generally will have a higher degree of market
	price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in
	determining fair value.




	45








	 






	Investments for which market prices are not observable include
	private investments in the equity of operating companies or real
	estate properties. Fair values of such investments are
	determined by reference to projected net earnings, earnings
	before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
	(EBITDA), the discounted cash flow method,
	comparable values in public market or private transactions,
	valuations for comparable companies and other measures which, in
	many cases, are unaudited at the time received. Valuations may
	be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for
	comparable companies or transactions (for example, multiplying a
	key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as
	EBITDA, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range
	of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management
	for differences between the investment and the referenced
	comparables, and in some instances by reference to option
	pricing models or other similar models. In determining fair
	values of real estate investments, we also consider projected
	operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, replacement
	costs and capitalization rates (cap rates) analysis.
	Additionally, where applicable, projected distributable cash
	flow through debt maturity will also be considered in support of
	the investments carrying value. The fair values of
	credit-oriented investments are generally determined on the
	basis of prices between market participants provided by
	reputable dealers or pricing services. Specifically, for
	investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds,
	the fair values are generally determined by valuations of
	comparable investments. In some instances, other valuation
	techniques, including the discounted cash flow method, may be
	used to value illiquid investments.


	 


	The determination of fair value using these methodologies takes
	into consideration a range of factors including but not limited
	to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of
	the investment, local market conditions, trading values on
	public exchanges for comparable securities, current and
	projected operating performance and financing transactions
	subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation
	methodologies involve a significant degree of management
	judgment. For example, as to investments that we share with
	another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology
	than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the
	other sponsor has derived on the same investment, which could
	cause some investors to question our valuations.


	 


	Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or
	in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair
	values of such investments as reflected in an investment
	funds net asset value do not necessarily reflect the
	prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment
	fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values
	significantly lower than the values at which investments have
	been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in
	reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund, the loss of
	potential carried interest and incentive fees and in the case of
	our hedge funds, management fees. Changes in values attributed
	to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility
	in the net asset values and results of operations that we report
	from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn
	out to be materially different than values reflected in prior
	fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence
	in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising
	additional funds.


	 





	The
	historical returns attributable to our funds, including those
	presented in this prospectus, should not be considered as
	indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future
	results or of any returns expected on an investment in our
	common units.





	 


	We have presented in this prospectus information relating to the
	historical performance of our investment funds. The historical
	and potential future returns of the investment funds that we
	advise are not directly linked to returns on our common units.
	Therefore, any continued positive performance of the investment
	funds that we advise will not necessarily result in positive
	returns on an investment in our common units. However, poor
	performance of the investment funds that we advise would cause a
	decline in our revenue from such investment funds, and could
	therefore have a negative effect on our performance, our ability
	to raise future funds and in all likelihood the returns on an
	investment in our common units.




	46








	 






	Moreover, with respect to the historical returns of our
	investment funds:


	 












	 


	 


	market conditions at times were significantly more favorable for
	generating positive performance, particularly in our Corporate
	Private Equity and Real Assets businesses, than the market
	conditions we experienced in recent years and may continue to
	experience for the foreseeable future;




	 




	 


	 


	the rates of returns of our carry funds reflect unrealized gains
	as of the applicable measurement date that may never be
	realized, which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized
	from those funds investments;




	 




	 


	 


	unitholders will not benefit from any value that was created in
	our funds prior to your investment in our common units to the
	extent such value has been realized;




	 




	 


	 


	in recent years, there has been increased competition for
	private equity investment opportunities resulting from the
	increased amount of capital invested in alternative investment
	funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased
	competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future;




	 




	 


	 


	the rates of returns of some of our funds in certain years have
	been positively influenced by a number of investments that
	experienced rapid and substantial increases in value following
	the dates on which those investments were made, which may not
	occur with respect to future investments;




	 




	 


	 


	our investment funds returns in some years have benefited
	from investment opportunities and general market conditions that
	may not repeat themselves (including, for example, particularly
	favorable borrowing conditions in the debt markets during 2005,
	2006 and early 2007), and our current or future investment funds
	might not be able to avail themselves of comparable investment
	opportunities or market conditions; and




	 




	 


	 


	we may create new funds in the future that reflect a different
	asset mix and different investment strategies, as well as a
	varied geographic and industry exposure as compared to our
	present funds, and any such new funds could have different
	returns than our existing or previous funds.




	 


	In addition, future returns will be affected by the applicable
	risks described elsewhere in this prospectus, including risks
	related to the industries and businesses in which our funds may
	invest. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
	Segment Analysis  Fund Performance Metrics
	for additional information.


	 





	Dependence
	on significant leverage in investments by our funds could
	adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of
	return on those investments.





	 


	Many of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles
	investments rely heavily on the use of leverage, and our ability
	to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend
	on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at
	attractive rates. For example, in many private equity
	investments, indebtedness may constitute and historically has
	constituted up to 70% or more of a portfolio companys or
	real estate assets total debt and equity capitalization,
	including debt that may be incurred in connection with the
	investment. The absence of available sources of sufficient debt
	financing for extended periods of time could therefore
	materially and adversely affect our Corporate Private Equity and
	Real Assets businesses. In addition, an increase in either the
	general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded
	by sources of indebtedness, such as the increase we experienced
	during 2009, would make it more expensive to finance those
	businesses investments. Increases in interest rates could
	also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private
	equity investments because other potential buyers, including
	operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to
	bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost
	of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of
	cost savings following the acquisition of





	47








	 






	the asset. In addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to
	finance private equity investments often includes high-yield
	debt securities issued in the capital markets. Availability of
	capital from the high-yield debt markets is subject to
	significant volatility, and there may be times when we might not
	be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all,
	when completing an investment. Finally, the interest payments on
	the indebtedness used to finance our carry funds and fund
	of funds vehicles investments are generally deductible
	expenses for income tax purposes, subject to limitations under
	applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or
	policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax
	deductions, as has been discussed from time to time in various
	jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the
	affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our
	business and financial results. See  Our funds
	make investments in companies that are based outside of the
	United States, which may expose us to additional risks not
	typically associated with investing in companies that are based
	in the United States.


	 


	Investments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently
	more sensitive to declines in revenue, increases in expenses and
	interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry
	developments. The incurrence of a significant amount of
	indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:


	 












	 


	 


	subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms
	and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by
	creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our
	ability to realize value from the investment;




	 




	 


	 


	allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render
	the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a
	bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of
	part or all of the equity investment in it;




	 




	 


	 


	give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt
	using excess cash flow, which might limit the entitys
	ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent
	additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned
	but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of
	growth opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	limit the entitys ability to adjust to changing market
	conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage
	compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;




	 




	 


	 


	limit the entitys ability to engage in strategic
	acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive
	returns or further growth; and




	 




	 


	 


	limit the entitys ability to obtain additional financing
	or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for
	capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate
	purposes.




	 


	As a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity
	is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less
	debt. For example, a number of investments consummated by
	private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized
	significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe
	economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt
	obligations due to a decrease in revenue and cash flow
	precipitated by the subsequent downturn during 2008 and 2009.
	Similarly, the leveraged nature of the investments of our Real
	Assets funds increases the risk that a decline in the fair value
	of the underlying real estate or tangible assets will result in
	their abandonment or foreclosure. For example, in 2009 and 2010,
	several investments of our real estate funds were foreclosed,
	resulting in aggregate write-offs of approximately
	$198 million in 2009 and $19 million in 2010.


	 


	When our private equity funds existing portfolio
	investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those
	investments matures in significant amounts and must be either
	repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if
	they have not generated sufficient cash flow to repay maturing
	debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the
	financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on
	satisfactory terms, or at all. If a limited availability of





	48








	 






	financing for such purposes were to persist for an extended
	period of time, when significant amounts of the debt incurred to
	finance our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets funds
	existing portfolio investments came due, these funds could be
	materially and adversely affected.


	 


	Many of our Global Market Strategies funds may choose to use
	leverage as part of their respective investment programs and
	regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use
	of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the
	possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment
	portfolio. A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase
	or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions
	(such as total return swaps) with counterparties that have
	embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred
	in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by
	appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be
	lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be
	accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the
	market value of such securities. Gains realized with borrowed
	funds may cause the funds net asset value to increase at a
	faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However,
	if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the
	funds net asset value could also decrease faster than if
	there had been no borrowings. Increases in interest rates could
	also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investment that our
	investment funds make.


	 


	Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse
	effect on our results of operations, financial condition and
	cash flow.


	 





	A
	decline in the pace or size of investments by our carry funds or
	fund of funds vehicles could result in our receiving less
	revenue from transaction fees.





	 


	The transaction fees that we earn are driven in part by the pace
	at which our funds make investments and the size of those
	investments. Any decline in that pace or the size of such
	investments could reduce our transaction fees and could make it
	more difficult for us to raise capital on our anticipated
	schedule. Many factors could cause such a decline in the pace of
	investment, including:


	 












	 


	 


	the inability of our investment professionals to identify
	attractive investment opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	competition for such opportunities among other potential
	acquirers;




	 




	 


	 


	decreased availability of capital on attractive terms; and




	 




	 


	 


	our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities
	because of business, regulatory or legal complexities and
	adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy or
	financial markets.




	 


	For example, the more limited financing options for large
	Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets investments resulting
	from the credit market dislocations in 2008 and 2009 reduced the
	pace and size of investments by our Corporate Private Equity and
	Real Assets funds.


	 


	In addition, we have confronted and expect to continue to
	confront requests from a variety of investors and groups
	representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction
	fees we share with our investors (or to decline to receive
	transaction fees from portfolio companies held by our funds). To
	the extent we accommodate such requests, it would result in a
	decrease in the amount of fee revenue we earn. See
	 Our investors in future funds may negotiate to
	pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our
	future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our
	existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.


	 





	The
	alternative asset management business is intensely
	competitive.





	 


	The alternative asset management business is intensely
	competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors,
	including investment performance, business relationships,
	quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and
	willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand
	recognition and business reputation. Our alternative asset
	management business competes with a





	49








	 






	number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds,
	hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional asset managers, real
	estate development companies, commercial banks, investment banks
	and other financial institutions (as well as sovereign wealth
	funds). For instance, Carlyle and Riverstone have mutually
	decided not to pursue another jointly managed fund as
	co-sponsors. Accordingly, we expect that our future energy and
	renewable funds will compete with Riverstone, among other
	alternative asset managers, for investment opportunities and
	fund investors in the energy and renewable space. A number of
	factors serve to increase our competitive risks:


	 












	 


	 


	a number of our competitors in some of our businesses have
	greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and
	more personnel than we do;




	 




	 


	 


	some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors
	funds or other available investment products;




	 




	 


	 


	a significant number of investors have materially decreased or
	temporarily suspended making new fund investments recently
	because of the global economic downturn and poor returns in
	their overall investment portfolios in 2008 and 2009;




	 




	 


	 


	several of our competitors have significant amounts of capital,
	and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours,
	which may create additional competition for investment
	opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing
	inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;




	 




	 


	 


	some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital
	and access to funding sources that are not available to us,
	which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect
	to investment opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances,
	different risk assessments or lower return thresholds than us,
	which could allow them to consider a wider variety of
	investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments
	that we want to make;




	 




	 


	 


	some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and
	accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute
	certain businesses or investments than we do

	and/or

	bear
	less compliance expense than we do;




	 




	 


	 


	some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in
	raising certain types of investment funds under the investment
	management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;




	 




	 


	 


	some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded
	by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset
	class or geographic region than we do;




	 




	 


	 


	our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve
	synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may
	provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an
	investment;




	 




	 


	 


	there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding the
	formation of new alternative asset management firms, and the
	successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses,
	including former star portfolio managers at large
	diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions
	themselves, is expected to continue to result in increased
	competition;




	 




	 


	 


	some investors may prefer to invest with an asset manager that
	is not publicly traded or is smaller with only one or two
	investment products that it manages; and




	 




	 


	 


	other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to
	recruit our investment professionals and other employees away
	from us.




	 


	We may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not
	match investment prices, structures and terms offered by our
	competitors. Alternatively, we may experience decreased rates of
	return and increased risks of loss if we match investment
	prices, structures and terms offered by our





	50








	 






	competitors. Moreover, if we are forced to compete with other
	alternative asset managers on the basis of price, we may not be
	able to maintain our current fund fee and carried interest
	terms. We have historically competed primarily on the
	performance of our funds, and not on the level of our fees or
	carried interest relative to those of our competitors. However,
	there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the
	alternative asset management industry will decline, without
	regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee or
	carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds,
	without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would
	adversely affect our revenues and profitability. See
	 Our investors in future funds may negotiate to
	pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our
	future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our
	existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.


	 


	In addition, the attractiveness of our investment funds relative
	to investments in other investment products could decrease
	depending on economic conditions. This competitive pressure
	could adversely affect our ability to make successful
	investments and limit our ability to raise future investment
	funds, either of which would adversely impact our business,
	revenue, results of operations and cash flow. See
	 Our investors in future funds may negotiate to
	pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our
	future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our
	existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.


	 





	The
	due diligence process that we undertake in connection with
	investments by our investment funds may not reveal all facts
	that may be relevant in connection with an
	investment.





	 


	Before making private equity and other investments, we conduct
	due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on
	the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The
	objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive
	investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances
	surrounding an investment and, in the case of private equity
	investments, prepare a framework that may be used from the date
	of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value
	creation. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to
	evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax,
	accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants,
	legal advisors, accountants and investment banks may be involved
	in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the
	type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence
	and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on the
	resources available to us, including information provided by the
	target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party
	investigations. The due diligence process may at times be
	subjective with respect to newly-organized companies for which
	only limited information is available. Accordingly, we cannot be
	certain that the due diligence investigation that we carry out
	with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or
	highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in
	evaluating such investment opportunity. Instances of fraud,
	accounting irregularities and other deceptive practices can be
	difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can
	be widespread in certain jurisdictions. Several of our funds
	invest in emerging market countries that may not have
	established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in
	more developed nations, or where existing laws and regulations
	may not be consistently enforced. For example, our funds invest
	throughout China, Latin America and MENA, and we have recently
	hired investment professionals to facilitate investment in

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa. Due diligence on investment opportunities in these
	jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent
	and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have
	developed. Fraud, accounting irregularities and deceptive
	practices can be especially difficult to detect in such
	locations. For example, two Chinese companies in which we have
	minority investments have recently been made the subject of
	internal investigations in connection with allegations of
	financial or accounting irregularities, and a purported class
	action has been brought against one of the Chinese companies and
	certain of its present and former officers and directors,
	including a Carlyle employee who is a former director of such
	entity. We do not have sufficient information at this time to
	give an assessment of the likely outcome of these matters or as
	to the ultimate impact these allegations, if true, may have on
	the value of our investments.




	51








	 






	We cannot be certain that our due diligence investigations will
	result in investments being successful or that the actual
	financial performance of an investment will not fall short of
	the financial projections we used when evaluating that
	investment. Failure to identify risks associated with our
	investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.


	 





	Our
	funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we
	may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a
	considerable period of time or lose some or all of our principal
	investments.





	 


	Many of our investment funds invest in securities that are not
	publicly traded. In many cases, our investment funds may be
	prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from
	selling such securities for a period of time. Our investment
	funds will not be able to sell these securities publicly unless
	their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or
	unless an exemption from such registration is available. The
	ability of many of our investment funds, particularly our
	private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily
	dependent on the public equity markets. For example, the ability
	to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the
	ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio
	company in which such investment is held. Even if the securities
	are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be
	disposed of only over a substantial length of time, exposing the
	investment returns to risks of downward movement in market
	prices during the intended disposition period. Accordingly,
	under certain conditions, our investment funds may be forced to
	either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to
	realize or defer, potentially for a considerable period of time,
	sales that they had planned to make. We have made and expect to
	continue to make significant principal investments in our
	current and future investment funds. Contributing capital to
	these investment funds is subject to significant risks, and we
	may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments.


	 





	The
	investments of our private equity funds are subject to a number
	of inherent risks.





	 


	Our results are highly dependent on our continued ability to
	generate attractive returns from our investments. Investments
	made by our private equity funds involve a number of significant
	risks inherent to private equity investing, including the
	following:


	 












	 


	 


	we advise funds that invest in businesses that operate in a
	variety of industries that are subject to extensive domestic and
	foreign regulation, such as the telecommunications industry, the
	aerospace, defense and government services industry and the
	healthcare industry (including companies that supply equipment
	and services to governmental agencies), that may involve greater
	risk due to rapidly changing market and governmental conditions
	in those sectors;




	 




	 


	 


	significant failures of our portfolio companies to comply with
	laws and regulations applicable to them could affect the ability
	of our funds to invest in other companies in certain industries
	in the future and could harm our reputation;




	 




	 


	 


	companies in which private equity investments are made may have
	limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their
	obligations, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the
	value of their equity securities or any collateral or guarantees
	provided with respect to their debt;




	 




	 


	 


	companies in which private equity investments are made are more
	likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a
	small group of persons and, as a result, the death, disability,
	resignation or termination of one or more of those persons could
	have a material adverse impact on their business and prospects
	and the investment made;




	 




	 


	 


	companies in which private equity investments are made may from
	time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly
	changing businesses with products subject to a







	52








	 
















	 




	substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial
	additional capital to support their operations, finance
	expansion or maintain their competitive position;




	 












	 


	 


	companies in which private equity investments are made generally
	have less predictable operating results;




	 




	 


	 


	instances of fraud and other deceptive practices committed by
	senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds
	invest may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to
	such companies and, upon the discovery of such fraud, negatively
	affect the valuation of a funds investments as well as
	contribute to overall market volatility that can negatively
	impact a funds investment program;




	 




	 


	 


	our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously
	dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved,
	either by expiration of such funds term or otherwise,
	resulting in a lower than expected return on the investments
	and, potentially, on the fund itself;




	 




	 


	 


	our funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio
	companies on the basis of the financial projections based
	primarily on management judgments and assumptions, and general
	economic conditions and other factors may cause actual
	performance to fall short of these financial projections, which
	could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity
	holdings in the portfolio company and cause our funds
	performance to fall short of our expectations; and




	 




	 


	 


	executive officers, directors and employees of an equity sponsor
	may be named as defendants in litigation involving a company in
	which a private equity investment is made or is being made.




	 





	Our
	real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the
	ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and
	development of real estate.





	 


	Investments in our real estate funds will be subject to the
	risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and
	real estate-related businesses and assets. These risks include
	the following:


	 












	 


	 


	those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property;




	 




	 


	 


	general and local economic conditions;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an
	area (as a result, for instance, of overbuilding);




	 




	 


	 


	fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel
	properties;




	 




	 


	 


	the financial resources of tenants;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in building, environmental and other laws;




	 




	 


	 


	energy and supply shortages;




	 




	 


	 


	various uninsured or uninsurable risks;




	 




	 


	 


	natural disasters;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in government regulations (such as rent control);




	 




	 


	 


	changes in real property tax rates;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in interest rates;




	 




	 


	 


	the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the
	sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable;




	 




	 


	 


	negative developments in the economy that depress travel
	activity;






	53








	 






	 












	 


	 


	environmental liabilities;




	 




	 


	 


	contingent liabilities on disposition of assets; and




	 




	 


	 


	terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our
	control.




	 


	During 2008 and 2009, real estate markets in the United States,
	Europe and Japan generally experienced increases in
	capitalization rates and declines in value as a result of the
	overall economic decline and the limited availability of
	financing. As a result, the value of investments in our real
	estate funds declined significantly. In addition, if our real
	estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped
	land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be
	non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally
	associated with such assets and development activities,
	including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt
	of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the
	cost and timely completion of construction (including risks
	beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor
	conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both
	construction and permanent financing on favorable terms.
	Additionally, our funds properties may be managed by a
	third party, which makes us dependent upon such third parties
	and subjects us to risks associated with the actions of such
	third parties. Any of these factors may cause the value of the
	investments in our real estate funds to decline, which may have
	a material impact on our results of operations.


	 





	We
	often pursue investment opportunities that involve business,
	regulatory, legal or other complexities.





	 


	As an element of our investment style, we may pursue unusually
	complex investment opportunities. This can often take the form
	of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that
	would deter other asset managers. Our tolerance for complexity
	presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult,
	expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it can be
	more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets
	acquired in such transactions; and such transactions sometimes
	entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk
	of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm the
	performance of our funds.


	 





	Our
	investment funds make investments in companies that we do not
	control.





	 


	Investments by many of our investment funds will include debt
	instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not
	control. Such instruments and securities may be acquired by our
	investment funds through trading activities or through purchases
	of securities from the issuer. In addition, our funds may
	acquire minority equity interests in large transactions, which
	may be structured as consortium transactions due to
	the size of the investment and the amount of capital required to
	be invested. A consortium transaction involves an equity
	investment in which two or more private equity firms serve
	together or collectively as equity sponsors. We participated in
	a number of consortium transactions in prior years due to the
	increased size of many of the transactions in which we were
	involved. Consortium transactions generally entail a reduced
	level of control by our firm over the investment because
	governance rights must be shared with the other consortium
	sponsors. Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions
	relating to a consortium investment, including decisions
	relating to the management and operation of the company and the
	timing and nature of any exit. Our funds may also dispose of a
	portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio
	companies over time in a manner that results in the funds
	retaining a minority investment. Those investments may be
	subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is
	made may make business, financial or management decisions with
	which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the
	management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a
	manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the
	foregoing were to occur, the value of investments by our funds
	could decrease and our financial condition, results of
	operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.

	Our
	funds make investments in companies that are based outside of
	the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not
	typically associated with investing in companies that are based
	in the United States.





	 


	Many of our investment funds generally invest a significant
	portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other
	securities of issuers that are based outside of the United
	States. A substantial amount of these investments consist of
	investments made by our carry funds. For example, as of December
	31, 2011, approximately 41% of the equity invested by our carry
	funds was attributable to foreign investments. Investments in

	non-U.S. securities

	involve risks not typically associated with investing in
	U.S. securities, including:


	 












	 


	 


	certain economic and political risks, including potential
	exchange control regulations and restrictions on our

	non-U.S. investments

	and repatriation of profits on investments or of capital
	invested, the risks of political, economic or social
	instability, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory
	taxation and adverse economic and political developments;




	 




	 


	 


	the imposition of

	non-U.S. taxes

	on gains from the sale of investments by our funds;




	 




	 


	 


	the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial
	reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and
	less government supervision and regulation;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could
	impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact
	the returns on our investments;




	 




	 


	 


	differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced
	legal and regulatory compliance;




	 




	 


	 


	limitations on borrowings to be used to fund acquisitions or
	dividends;




	 




	 


	 


	political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity
	investors;




	 




	 


	 


	less liquid markets;




	 




	 


	 


	reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service
	providers

	and/or

	distribution mechanisms;




	 




	 


	 


	adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs
	associated with conversion of investment principal and income
	from one currency into another;




	 




	 


	 


	higher rates of inflation;




	 




	 


	 


	higher transaction costs;




	 




	 


	 


	less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers;




	 




	 


	 


	less developed bankruptcy, corporate, partnership and other laws;




	 




	 


	 


	difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations;




	 




	 


	 


	less stringent requirements relating to fiduciary duties;




	 




	 


	 


	fewer investor protections; and




	 




	 


	 


	greater price volatility.




	 


	We operate in numerous national and subnational jurisdictions
	throughout the world and are subject to complex taxation
	requirements that could result in the imposition of taxes upon
	us that exceed the amounts we reserve for such purposes. In
	addition, the portfolio companies of our funds are typically
	subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
	In Denmark, Germany and France, for example, the deductibility
	of interest and other financing expenses in companies in which
	our funds have invested or may invest in the future may be
	limited. This could adversely affect portfolio companies that
	operate in those countries and limit the benefit of additional
	investments in those countries.




	55








	 






	Our funds investments that are denominated in a foreign
	currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a
	particular currency will change in relation to one or more other
	currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values
	are trade balances, levels of short-term interest rates,
	differences in relative values of similar assets in different
	currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital
	appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging
	techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no
	assurance that such strategies will be effective. If we engage
	in hedging transactions, we may be exposed to additional risks
	associated with such transactions. See  Risks
	Related to Our Business Operations  Risk management
	activities may adversely affect the return on our funds
	investments.


	 





	We may
	need to pay giveback obligations if and when they
	are triggered under the governing agreements with our
	investors.





	 


	If, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with
	respect to certain of our real estate funds), the carry fund has
	not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the
	preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner
	receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its
	allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we
	will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to
	which carried interest that was previously distributed to us
	exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. These
	repayment obligations may be related to amounts previously
	distributed to our senior Carlyle professionals prior to the
	completion of this offering, with respect to which our common
	unitholders did not receive any benefit. This obligation is
	known as a giveback obligation. As of
	December 31, 2011, we had accrued a giveback obligation of
	$136.5 million, representing the giveback obligation that
	would need to be paid if the carry funds were liquidated at
	their current fair values at that date. If, as of
	December 31, 2011, all of the investments held by our carry
	funds were deemed worthless, the amount of realized and
	distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would
	have been $856.7 million, on an after-tax basis where
	applicable. Although a giveback obligation is several to each
	person who received a distribution, and not a joint obligation,
	the governing agreements of our funds generally provide that to
	the extent a recipient does not fund his or her respective
	share, then we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond
	the amount of carried interest we retained, although we
	generally will retain the right to pursue any remedies that we
	have under such governing agreements against those carried
	interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We have
	historically withheld a portion of the cash from carried
	interest distributions to individual senior Carlyle
	professionals and other employees as security for their
	potential giveback obligations. However, we have not at this
	time set aside cash reserves relating to our secondary liability
	for such giveback obligations or in respect of giveback
	obligations related to carried interest we may receive and
	retain in the future. We intend to monitor our giveback
	obligations and may need to use or reserve cash to repay such
	giveback obligations instead of using the cash for other
	purposes. See Business  Structure and Operation
	of Our Investment Funds  Incentive
	Arrangements / Fee Structure and
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual
	Obligations  Contingent Obligations (Giveback)
	and Notes 2 and 10 to the combined and consolidated
	financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 





	Our
	investment funds often make common equity investments that rank
	junior to preferred equity and debt in a companys capital
	structure.





	 


	In most cases, the companies in which our investment funds
	invest have, or are permitted to have, outstanding indebtedness
	or equity securities that rank senior to our funds
	investment. By their terms, such instruments may provide that
	their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends,
	interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments
	are to be made in respect of our investment. Also, in the event
	of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or
	bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders
	of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically
	be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions
	could be made in respect of our investment. After repaying
	senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining
	assets to use for





	56








	 






	repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment. To the
	extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank
	equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an
	equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of
	those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or
	following an insolvency, the ability of our funds to influence a
	companys affairs and to take actions to protect their
	investments may be substantially less than that of the senior
	creditors.


	 





	Third-party
	investors in substantially all of our carry funds have the right
	to remove the general partner of the fund for cause, to
	accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without
	cause by a simple majority vote and to terminate the investment
	period under certain circumstances and investors in certain of
	the investment funds we advise may redeem their investments.
	These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which
	could be substantial.





	 


	The governing agreements of substantially all of our carry funds
	provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party
	investors in those funds have the right to remove the general
	partner of the fund for cause (other than the AlpInvest fund of
	funds vehicles) or to accelerate the liquidation date of the
	investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote,
	resulting in a reduction in management fees we would earn from
	such investment funds and a significant reduction in the
	expected amounts of total carried interest and incentive fees
	from those funds. Carried interest and incentive fees could be
	significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize
	the value of investments by an investment fund during the
	liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a
	giveback obligation. Finally, the applicable funds
	would cease to exist after completion of liquidation and

	winding-up.

	In addition, the governing agreements of our investment funds
	provide that in the event certain key persons in our
	investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with
	regard to managing the fund (for example, Messrs. Conway,
	DAniello and Rubenstein, in the case of our private equity
	funds), then investors in certain funds have the right to vote
	to terminate the investment period by a simple majority vote in
	accordance with specified procedures, accelerate the withdrawal
	of their capital on an

	investor-by-investor

	basis, or the funds investment period will automatically
	terminate and the vote of a simple majority of investors is
	required to restart it. In addition to having a significant
	negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the
	occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our
	investment funds would likely result in significant reputational
	damage to us and could negatively impact our future fundraising
	efforts.


	 


	The AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles generally provide for
	suspension or termination of investment commitments in the event
	of cause, key person or regulatory events, changes in control of
	Carlyle or of majority ownership of AlpInvest, and, in some
	cases, other performance metrics, but generally have not
	provided for liquidation without cause. Where AlpInvest fund of
	funds vehicles include key person provisions, they
	are focused on specific existing AlpInvest personnel. While we
	believe that existing AlpInvest management have appropriate
	incentives to remain at AlpInvest, based on equity ownership,
	profit participation and other contractual provisions, we are
	not able to guarantee the ongoing participation of AlpInvest
	management team members in respect of the AlpInvest fund of
	funds vehicles. In addition, AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles
	have historically had few or even a single investor. In such
	cases, an individual investor may hold disproportionate
	authority over decisions reserved for

	third-party

	investors.


	 


	Investors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their
	investments on an annual,

	semi-annual

	or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified
	period of time when capital may not be withdrawn (typically
	between one and three years), subject to the applicable
	funds specific redemption provisions. In a declining
	market, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our
	AUM could accelerate. The decrease in revenues that would result
	from significant redemptions in our hedge funds could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow.


	 


	In addition, because our investment funds generally have an
	adviser that is registered under the Advisers Act, the
	management agreements of all of our investment funds would be
	terminated upon





	57








	 






	an assignment of these agreements without investor
	consent, which assignment may be deemed to occur in the event
	these advisers were to experience a change of control. We cannot
	be certain that consents required to assignments of our
	investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of
	control occurs. Assignment of these agreements
	without investor consent could cause us to lose the fees we earn
	from such investment funds.


	 





	Third-party
	investors in our investment funds with commitment-based
	structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund
	capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect
	a funds operations and performance.





	 


	Investors in our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles make
	capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call
	from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We
	depend on investors fulfilling their commitments when we call
	capital from them in order for those funds to consummate
	investments and otherwise pay their obligations (for example,
	management fees) when due. Any investor that did not fund a
	capital call would generally be subject to several possible
	penalties, including having a significant amount of its existing
	investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the
	penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital
	previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an
	investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early
	in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be
	as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or
	reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby inhibiting
	our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. If
	investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of
	capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation
	and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely
	affected.


	 





	Our
	failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in our
	investment business could damage our reputation and adversely
	affect our businesses.





	 


	As we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and
	scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential
	conflicts of interest relating to our funds investment
	activities. Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment
	objectives, including funds that have different fee structures,
	and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions
	regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those
	funds. For example, a decision to acquire material non-public
	information about a company while pursuing an investment
	opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential
	conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict
	the ability of other funds to take any action. We may also cause
	different private equity funds to invest in a single portfolio
	company, for example where the fund that made an initial
	investment no longer has capital available to invest. We may
	also cause different funds that we manage to purchase different
	classes of securities in the same portfolio company. For
	example, one of our CLO funds could acquire a debt security
	issued by the same company in which one of our buyout funds owns
	common equity securities. A direct conflict of interest could
	arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a
	company were to develop insolvency concerns, and that conflict
	would have to be carefully managed by us. In addition, conflicts
	of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and
	regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment
	opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees
	and costs among us, our funds and their portfolio companies.
	Lastly, in certain infrequent instances we may purchase an
	investment alongside one of our investment funds or sell an
	investment to one of our investment funds and conflicts may
	arise in respect of the allocation, pricing and timing of such
	investments and the ultimate disposition of such investments. To
	the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such
	conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability
	to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties
	to do business with us or result in potential litigation against
	us.




	58








	 









	Risk
	management activities may adversely affect the return on our
	funds investments.





	 


	When managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own
	behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward
	contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors or pursue
	other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to
	limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of
	investments that may result from market developments, including
	changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates
	and commodity prices. The scope of risk management activities
	undertaken by us varies based on the level and volatility of
	interest rates, prevailing foreign currency exchange rates, the
	types of investments that are made and other changing market
	conditions. The use of hedging transactions and other derivative
	instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a
	position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in
	the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the
	position declines. Such transactions may also limit the
	opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases.
	Moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a
	market development that is so generally anticipated that a
	hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into
	at an acceptable price. The success of any hedging or other
	derivative transaction generally will depend on our ability to
	correctly predict market changes, the degree of correlation
	between price movements of a derivative instrument and the
	position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty
	and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into such a
	transaction in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, the
	transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance
	than if it had not been executed.


	 





	Certain
	of our fund investments may be concentrated in particular asset
	types or geographic regions, which could exacerbate any negative
	performance of those funds to the extent those concentrated
	investments perform poorly.





	 


	The governing agreements of our investment funds contain only
	limited investment restrictions and only limited requirements as
	to diversification of fund investments, either by geographic
	region or asset type. For example, we advise funds that invest
	predominantly in the United States, Europe, Asia, Japan or MENA;
	and we advise funds that invest in a single industry sector,
	such as financial services. During periods of difficult market
	conditions or slowdowns in these sectors or geographic regions,
	decreased revenue, difficulty in obtaining access to financing
	and increased funding costs experienced by our funds may be
	exacerbated by this concentration of investments, which would
	result in lower investment returns for our funds. Such
	concentration may increase the risk that events affecting a
	specific geographic region or asset type will have an adverse or
	disparate impact on such investment funds, as compared to funds
	that invest more broadly.


	 





	Certain
	of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies
	that are experiencing significant financial or business
	difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or
	other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Such
	investments may be subject to a greater risk of poor performance
	or loss.





	 


	Certain of our investment funds, especially our distressed and
	corporate opportunities funds, may invest in business
	enterprises involved in work-outs, liquidations,
	reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions and may
	purchase high risk receivables. An investment in such business
	enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such
	business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful,
	will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of
	cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the
	purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial
	instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. In
	addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur,
	the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss.
	Investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected
	by U.S. federal and state laws relating to, among other
	things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender
	liability and a bankruptcy courts discretionary power to
	disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims.
	Investments in securities and private claims of troubled
	companies made in connection with an





	59








	 






	attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of
	reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial
	litigation. Because there is substantial uncertainty concerning
	the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled
	companies, there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its
	entire investment in such company.


	 





	Our
	private equity funds performance, and our performance, may
	be adversely affected by the financial performance of our
	portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds
	invest.





	 


	Our performance and the performance of our private equity funds
	is significantly impacted by the value of the companies in which
	our funds have invested. Our funds invest in companies in many
	different industries, each of which is subject to volatility
	based upon economic and market factors. Over the last few years,
	the credit crisis has caused significant fluctuations in the
	value of securities held by our funds and the global economic
	recession had a significant impact in overall performance
	activity and the demands for many of the goods and services
	provided by portfolio companies of the funds we advise. Although
	the U.S. economy has begun to improve, there remain many
	obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as high
	unemployment, global geopolitical events, risks of inflation and
	high deficit levels for governments in the United
	States and abroad. These factors and other general economic
	trends are likely to impact the performance of portfolio
	companies in many industries and in particular, industries that
	are more impacted by changes in consumer demand, such as the
	consumer products sector and real estate. In addition, the value
	of our investments in portfolio companies in the financial
	services industry is impacted by the overall health and
	stability of the credit markets. For example, the recent
	speculation regarding the inability of Greece and certain other
	European countries to pay their national debt, the response by
	Eurozone policy makers to mitigate this sovereign debt crisis
	and the concerns regarding the stability of the Eurozone
	currency have created uncertainty in the credit markets. As a
	result, there has been a strain on banks and other financial
	services participants, including our portfolio companies in the
	financial services industry, which could have a material adverse
	impact on such portfolio companies. The performance of our
	private equity funds, and our performance, may be adversely
	affected to the extent our fund portfolio companies in these
	industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure
	due to downward trends. In respect of real estate, various
	factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and
	have an adverse effect on investment performance, including, but
	not limited to, continued high unemployment, a low level of
	consumer confidence in the economy

	and/or

	the
	residential real estate market and rising mortgage interest
	rates.


	 





	The
	financial projections of our portfolio companies could prove
	inaccurate.





	 


	Our funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio
	companies on the basis of financial projections prepared by the
	management of such portfolio companies. These projected
	operating results will normally be based primarily on judgments
	of the management of the portfolio companies. In all cases,
	projections are only estimates of future results that are based
	upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are
	developed. General economic conditions, which are not
	predictable, along with other factors may cause actual
	performance to fall short of the financial projections that were
	used to establish a given portfolio companys capital
	structure. Because of the leverage that we typically employ in
	our investments, this could cause a substantial decrease in the
	value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company. The
	inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our
	funds performance to fall short of our expectations.


	 





	Contingent
	liabilities could harm fund performance.





	 


	We may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject
	to contingent liabilities. Such contingent liabilities could be
	unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known
	to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks
	that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus
	result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in
	connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio
	company, a fund may be required to make





	60








	 






	representations about the business and financial affairs of such
	portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the
	sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the
	purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such
	representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in
	the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after
	the disposition of an investment. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of
	representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such
	funds performance.


	 





	We and
	our investment funds are subject to risks in using prime
	brokers, custodians, administrators and other
	agents.





	 


	We and many of our investment funds depend on the services of
	prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents to
	carry out certain securities transactions. The counterparty to
	one or more of our or our funds contractual arrangements
	could default on its obligations under the contract. If a
	counterparty defaults, we and our funds may be unable to take
	action to cover the exposure and we or one or more of our funds
	could incur material losses. The consolidation and elimination
	of counterparties resulting from the disruption in the financial
	markets has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and
	has decreased the number of potential counterparties. Our funds
	generally are not restricted from dealing with any particular
	counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their
	transactions with one counterparty. In the event of the
	insolvency of a party that is holding our assets or those of our
	funds as collateral, we and our funds may not be able to recover
	equivalent assets in full as we and our funds will rank among
	the counterpartys unsecured creditors. In addition, our
	and our funds cash held with a prime broker, custodian or
	counterparty may not be segregated from the prime brokers,
	custodians or counterpartys own cash, and we and our
	funds therefore may rank as unsecured creditors in relation
	thereto. The inability to recover our or our investment
	funds assets could have a material impact on us or on the
	performance of our funds.


	 





	Our
	Fund of Funds Solutions business is subject to additional
	risks.





	 


	We established our Fund of Funds Solutions business on
	July 1, 2011 at the time we completed our acquisition of
	AlpInvest. Our Fund of Funds Solutions business is subject to
	additional risks, including the following:


	 












	 


	 


	The AlpInvest business is subject to business and other risks
	and uncertainties generally consistent with our business as a
	whole, including without limitation legal and regulatory risks,
	the avoidance or management of conflicts of interest and the
	ability to attract and retain investment professionals and other
	personnel.




	 




	 


	 


	We will restrict our

	day-to-day

	participation in the AlpInvest business, which may in turn limit
	our ability to address risks arising from the AlpInvest business
	for so long as AlpInvest maintains separate investment
	operations. Although we maintain ultimate control over
	AlpInvest, AlpInvests historical management team (who are
	our employees) will continue to exercise independent investment
	authority without involvement by other Carlyle personnel. For so
	long as these arrangements are in place, Carlyle representatives
	will serve on the board of AlpInvest but we will observe
	substantial restrictions on our ability to access investment
	information or engage in

	day-to-day

	participation in the AlpInvest investment business, including a
	restriction that AlpInvest investment decisions are made and
	maintained without involvement by other Carlyle personnel and
	that no specific investment data, other than data on the
	investment performance of its client mandates, will be shared.
	As such, we will have a reduced ability to identify or respond
	to investment and other operational issues that may arise within
	the AlpInvest business, relative to other Carlyle investment
	funds.




	 




	 


	 


	AlpInvest is currently subject to capital requirements which may
	limit our ability to withdraw cash from AlpInvest, or require
	additional investments of capital in order for AlpInvest to
	maintain certain licenses to operate its business.






	61








	 






	 












	 


	 


	Historically, the main part of AlpInvest capital commitments
	have been obtained from its initial co-owners, with such owners
	thereby holding highly concentrated voting rights with respect
	to potential suspension or termination of investment commitments
	made to AlpInvest.




	 




	 


	 


	AlpInvest is expected to seek to broaden its client base by
	advising separate accounts for investors on an

	account-by-account

	basis. AlpInvest has only limited experience in attracting new
	clients and may not be successful in this strategy.




	 




	 


	 


	AlpInvests co-investment business is subject to the risk
	that other private equity sponsors, alongside whom AlpInvest has
	historically invested in leveraged buyouts and growth capital
	transactions throughout Europe, North America and Asia, will no
	longer be willing to provide AlpInvest with investment
	opportunities as favorable as in the past, if at all, as a
	result of our ownership of AlpInvest.




	 




	 


	 


	AlpInvests secondary investments business is subject to
	the risk that opportunities in the secondary investments market
	may not be as favorable as the recent past.




	 





	Our
	hedge fund investments are subject to additional
	risks.





	 


	Investments by the hedge funds we advise are subject to
	additional risks, including the following:


	 












	 


	 


	Generally, there are few limitations on the execution of these
	hedge funds investment strategies, which are subject to
	the sole discretion of the management company or the general
	partner of such funds.




	 




	 


	 


	These funds may engage in short-selling, which is subject to a
	theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit
	on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the
	short position is closed out. A fund may be subject to losses if
	a security lender demands return of the lent securities and an
	alternative lending source cannot be found or if the fund is
	otherwise unable to borrow securities that are necessary to
	hedge its positions.




	 




	 


	 


	These funds may be limited in their ability to engage in short
	selling or other activities as a result of regulatory mandates.
	Such regulatory actions may limit our ability to engage in
	hedging activities and therefore impair our investment
	strategies. In addition, these funds may invest in securities
	and other assets for which appropriate market hedges do not
	exist or cannot be acquired on attractive terms.




	 




	 


	 


	These funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not
	settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions
	because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or
	not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus
	causing the fund to suffer a loss.




	 




	 


	 


	Credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large
	institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their
	liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one
	institution causes a series of defaults by the other
	institutions. This systemic risk could have a
	further material adverse effect on the financial intermediaries
	(such as prime brokers, clearing agencies, clearing houses,
	banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which these funds
	transact on a daily basis.




	 




	 


	 


	The efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely
	on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market
	position in a combination of financial instruments, which can be
	difficult to execute.




	 




	 


	 


	These funds may make investments or hold trading positions in
	markets that are volatile and may become illiquid.




	 




	 


	 


	These funds investments are subject to risks relating to
	investments in commodities, futures, options and other
	derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be
	subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain
	circumstances. In addition, the funds assets are







	62








	 
















	 




	subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on
	which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or
	counterparties.




	 












	 


	 


	These funds may make investments that they do not advantageously
	dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved,
	either by expiration of such funds term or otherwise.
	Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed
	of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution
	at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds have a
	limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent
	of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as
	applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise
	dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of
	dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return
	on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.





	 




	Risks
	Related to Our Organizational Structure





	 





	Our
	common unitholders do not elect our general partner or, except
	in limited circumstances, vote on our general partners
	directors and will have limited ability to influence decisions
	regarding our business.





	 


	Our general partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., which is
	owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, will manage all of
	our operations and activities. The limited liability company
	agreement of Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. establishes a board
	of directors that will be responsible for the oversight of our
	business and operations. Unlike the holders of common stock in a
	corporation, our common unitholders will have only limited
	voting rights and will have no right to remove our general
	partner or, except in the limited circumstances described below,
	elect the directors of our general partner. Our common
	unitholders will have no right to elect the directors of our
	general partner unless, as determined on January 31 of each
	year, the total voting power held by holders of the special
	voting units in The Carlyle Group L.P. (including voting units
	held by our general partner and its affiliates) in their
	capacity as such, or otherwise held by then-current or former
	Carlyle personnel (treating voting units deliverable to such
	persons pursuant to outstanding equity awards as being held by
	them), collectively, constitutes less than 10% of the voting
	power of the outstanding voting units of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	Unless and until the foregoing voting power condition is
	satisfied, our general partners board of directors will be
	elected in accordance with its limited liability company
	agreement, which provides that directors may be appointed and
	removed by members of our general partner holding a majority in
	interest of the voting power of the members, which voting power
	is allocated to each member ratably according to his or her
	aggregate relative ownership of our common units and partnership
	units. Immediately following this offering our existing owners
	will collectively have 90.0% of the voting power of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. limited partners, or 88.7% if the underwriters
	exercise in full their option to purchase additional common
	units. As a result, our common unitholders will have limited
	ability to influence decisions regarding our business. See
	Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement  Election of Directors of General
	Partner.


	 





	Our
	senior Carlyle professionals will be able to determine the
	outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of
	the limited partners.





	 


	Immediately following this offering, our existing owners will
	beneficially own 90.0% of the equity in our business, or 88.7%
	if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units. TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an
	entity wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, will
	hold a special voting unit that provides it with a number of
	votes on any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our
	common unitholders (voting together as a single class on all
	such matters) that is equal to the aggregate number of vested
	and unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, immediately
	following this offering our existing owners generally will have
	sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few
	matters that may be submitted for a vote of the limited partners
	of The Carlyle Group L.P. See Material Provisions of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership





	63








	 






	Agreement  Withdrawal or Removal of the General
	Partner,  Meetings; Voting and
	 Election of Directors of General Partner.


	 


	Our common unitholders voting rights will be further
	restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement stating
	that any common units held by a person that beneficially owns
	20% or more of any class of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units
	then outstanding (other than our general partner and its
	affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of
	our general partner or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any
	matter. In addition, our partnership agreement will contain
	provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to
	call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as
	well as other provisions limiting the ability of our common
	unitholders to influence the manner or direction of our
	management. Our partnership agreement also will not restrict our
	general partners ability to take actions that may result
	in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes.
	Furthermore, the common unitholders will not be entitled to
	dissenters rights of appraisal under our partnership
	agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a merger or
	consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets or any
	other transaction or event.


	 


	As a result of these matters and the provisions referred to
	under  Our common unitholders do not elect our
	general partner or, except in limited circumstances, vote on our
	general partners directors and will have limited ability
	to influence decisions regarding our business, our common
	unitholders may be deprived of an opportunity to receive a
	premium for their common units in the future through a sale of
	The Carlyle Group L.P., and the trading prices of our common
	units may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a
	takeover premium in the trading price.


	 





	We are
	permitted to repurchase all of the outstanding common units
	under certain circumstances, and this repurchase may occur at an
	undesirable time or price.





	 


	We have the right to acquire all of our then-outstanding common
	units at the then-current trading price either if 10% or less of
	our common units are held by persons other than our general
	partner and its affiliates or if we are required to register as
	an investment company under the 1940 Act. As a result of our
	general partners right to purchase outstanding common
	units, a holder of common units may have his common units
	purchased at an undesirable time or price.


	 





	We are
	a limited partnership and as a result will qualify for and
	intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance
	and other requirements under the rules of the NASDAQ Global
	Select Market and the Securities and Exchange
	Commission.





	 


	We are a limited partnership and will qualify for exceptions
	from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the
	rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Pursuant to these
	exceptions, limited partnerships may elect not to comply with
	certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global
	Select Market, including the requirements (1) that a
	majority of the board of directors of our general partner
	consist of independent directors, (2) that we have
	independent director oversight of executive officer compensation
	and director nominations and (3) that we obtain unitholder
	approval for (a) certain private placements of units that
	equal or exceed 20% of the outstanding common units or voting
	power, (b) certain acquisitions of stock or assets of
	another company or (c) a change of control transaction. In
	addition, we will not be required to hold annual meetings of our
	common unitholders. Following this offering, we intend to avail
	ourselves of these exceptions. Accordingly, you will not have
	the same protections afforded to equityholders of entities that
	are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of
	the NASDAQ Global Select Market.


	 


	In addition, on March 30, 2011, the SEC proposed rules to
	implement provisions of the

	Dodd-Frank

	Act pertaining to compensation committee independence and the
	role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other
	advisers to the compensation committee. The SECs proposed





	64








	 






	rules, if adopted, would direct each of the national securities
	exchanges (including the NASDAQ Global Select Market) to develop
	listing standards requiring, among other things, that:


	 












	 


	 


	compensation committees be composed of fully independent
	directors, as determined pursuant to new independence
	requirements;




	 




	 


	 


	compensation committees be explicitly charged with hiring and
	overseeing compensation consultants, legal counsel and other
	committee advisors; and






	 












	 


	 


	compensation committees be required to consider, when engaging
	compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors,
	certain independence factors, including factors that examine the
	relationship between the consultant or advisors employer
	and the company.




	 


	As a limited partnership, we will not be subject to these
	compensation committee independence requirements if and when
	they are adopted by the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the
	SECs proposed rules.


	 





	Potential
	conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner, its
	affiliates and us. Our general partner and its affiliates have
	limited fiduciary duties to us and our common unitholders, which
	may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of
	us and our common unitholders.





	 


	Conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner and
	its affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our common
	unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts,
	our general partner may favor its own interests and the
	interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common
	unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the
	following:


	 












	 


	 


	our general partner determines the amount and timing of our
	investments and dispositions, indebtedness, issuances of
	additional partnership interests and amounts of reserves, each
	of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for
	distribution to you;




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner is allowed to take into account the
	interests of parties other than us and the common unitholders in
	resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of
	limiting its duties (including fiduciary duties) to our common
	unitholders. For example, our subsidiaries that serve as the
	general partners of our investment funds have certain duties and
	obligations to those funds and their investors as a result of
	which we expect to regularly take actions in a manner consistent
	with such duties and obligations but that might adversely affect
	our near-term results of operations or cash flow;




	 




	 


	 


	because our senior Carlyle professionals hold their Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units directly or through entities that are
	not subject to corporate income taxation and The Carlyle Group
	L.P. holds Carlyle Holdings partnership units through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, some of which are subject to
	corporate income taxation, conflicts may arise between our
	senior Carlyle professionals and The Carlyle Group L.P. relating
	to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and
	other matters. For example, the earlier disposition of assets
	following an exchange or acquisition transaction by a senior
	Carlyle professional generally will accelerate payments under
	the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of
	such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange
	or acquisition transaction will increase an existing
	owners tax liability without giving rise to any rights of
	an existing owner to receive payments under the tax receivable
	agreement;




	 




	 


	 


	our partnership agreement does not prohibit affiliates of the
	general partner, including its owners, from engaging in other
	businesses or activities, including those that might directly
	compete with us;




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner has limited its liability and reduced or
	eliminated its duties (including fiduciary duties) under the
	partnership agreement, while also restricting the remedies
	available to our common unitholders for actions that, without
	these limitations, might constitute breaches of duty (including
	fiduciary duty). In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our
	general







	65








	 
















	 




	partner and its affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by
	law, except with respect to conduct involving bad faith, fraud
	or willful misconduct.

	By purchasing our common units, you
	will have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in
	our partnership agreement, including the provisions regarding
	conflicts of interest situations that, in the absence of such
	provisions, might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other
	duties under applicable state law;





	 












	 


	 


	our partnership agreement will not restrict our general partner
	from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services
	rendered, or from entering into additional contractual
	arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long
	as our general partner agrees to the terms of any such
	additional contractual arrangements in good faith as determined
	under the partnership agreement;




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner determines how much debt we incur and that
	decision may adversely affect our credit ratings;




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and
	its affiliates are reimbursable by us;




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed
	to us by it and its affiliates; and




	 




	 


	 


	our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel,
	accountants or others to perform services for us.




	 


	See Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions and Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary
	Responsibilities.


	 





	Our
	partnership agreement will contain provisions that reduce or
	eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our general
	partner and limit remedies available to common unitholders for
	actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty. It
	will be difficult for a common unitholder to successfully
	challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our general
	partner or by its conflicts committee.





	 


	Our partnership agreement will contain provisions that waive or
	consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates
	that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with
	fiduciary duties or applicable law. For example, our partnership
	agreement will provide that when our general partner is acting
	in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our
	general partner, it may act without any fiduciary obligations to
	us or our common unitholders whatsoever. When our general
	partner, in its capacity as our general partner, is permitted to
	or required to make a decision in its sole
	discretion or discretion or pursuant to any
	provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express
	standard of good faith, then our general partner
	will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as
	it desires, including its own interests, and will have no duty
	or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration
	to any interest of or factors affecting us or any limited
	partners and will not be subject to any different standards
	imposed by the partnership agreement, otherwise existing at law,
	in equity or otherwise.


	 


	The modifications of fiduciary duties contained in our
	partnership agreement are expressly permitted by Delaware law.
	Hence, we and our common unitholders will only have recourse and
	be able to seek remedies against our general partner if our
	general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our
	partnership agreement. Unless our general partner breaches its
	obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement, we and our
	common unitholders will not have any recourse against our
	general partner even if our general partner were to act in a
	manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties.
	Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of the obligations
	set forth in our partnership agreement, our partnership
	agreement will provide that our general partner and its officers
	and directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders
	for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there
	has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of
	competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or
	its officers and directors acted in bad





	66








	 






	faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. These
	modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because
	they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for
	actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches
	of duty (including fiduciary duty).


	 


	Whenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us, any
	of our subsidiaries or any of our partners, and our general
	partner or its affiliates, our general partner may resolve such
	conflict of interest. Our general partners resolution of
	the conflict of interest will conclusively be deemed approved by
	the partnership and all of our partners, and not to constitute a
	breach of the partnership agreement or any duty, unless the
	general partner subjectively believes such determination or
	action is opposed to the best interests of the partnership. A
	common unitholder seeking to challenge this resolution of the
	conflict of interest would bear the burden of proving that the
	general partner subjectively believed that such resolution was
	opposed to the best interests of the partnership. This is
	different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a
	conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to
	be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of
	demonstrating that the resolution was fair.


	 


	Also, if our general partner obtains the approval of the
	conflicts committee of our general partner, any determination or
	action by the general partner will be conclusively deemed to be
	made or taken in good faith and not a breach by our general
	partner of the partnership agreement or any duties it may owe to
	us or our common unitholders. This is different from the
	situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict
	resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent
	directors may, in certain circumstances, merely shift the burden
	of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff.

	By purchasing
	our common units, you will have agreed and consented to the
	provisions set forth in our partnership agreement, including the
	provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in
	the absence of such provisions, might constitute a breach of
	fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.

	As a
	result, common unitholders will, as a practical matter, not be
	able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the
	conflicts committee. See Certain Relationships and Related
	Person Transactions and Conflicts of Interest and
	Fiduciary Responsibilities.


	 





	The
	control of our general partner may be transferred to a third
	party without common unitholder consent.





	 


	Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to
	a third party in a merger or consolidation without the consent
	of our common unitholders. Furthermore, at any time, the members
	of our general partner may sell or transfer all or part of their
	limited liability company interests in our general partner
	without the approval of the common unitholders, subject to
	certain restrictions as described elsewhere in this prospectus.
	A new general partner may not be willing or able to form new
	investment funds and could form funds that have investment
	objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those
	of our current investment funds. A new owner could also have a
	different investment philosophy, employ investment professionals
	who are less experienced, be unsuccessful in identifying
	investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as
	successful as Carlyles track record. If any of the
	foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in
	making new investments, and the value of our existing
	investments, our business, our results of operations and our
	financial condition could materially suffer.


	 





	Our
	ability to pay periodic distributions to our common unitholders
	may be limited by our holding partnership structure, applicable
	provisions of Delaware law and contractual restrictions and
	obligations.





	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and has no
	material assets other than the ownership of the partnership
	units in Carlyle Holdings held through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries. The Carlyle Group L.P. has no independent means of
	generating revenue. Accordingly, we intend to cause Carlyle
	Holdings to make distributions to its partners, including The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries, to fund any
	distributions The Carlyle Group L.P. may declare on the





	67








	 






	common units. If Carlyle Holdings makes such distributions, the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings will be entitled to receive
	equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership
	interests in Carlyle Holdings. Because Carlyle Holdings I GP
	Inc. must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable
	agreement, the amounts ultimately distributed by The Carlyle
	Group L.P. to common unitholders are expected to be less, on a
	per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships to the limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships in respect of their Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units.


	 


	The declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the
	sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our
	distribution policy at any time and there can be no assurance
	that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, will or
	can be paid. Our ability to make cash distributions to our
	common unitholders will depend on a number of factors, including
	among other things, general economic and business conditions,
	our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment
	opportunities, our financial condition and operating results,
	working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs,
	contractual restrictions and obligations, including fulfilling
	our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and
	regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on
	the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or
	by our subsidiaries to us, payments required pursuant to the tax
	receivable agreement and such other factors as our general
	partner may deem relevant.


	 


	Under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a
	distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our
	liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of
	their partnership interests and liabilities for which the
	recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the
	partnership, would exceed the fair value of our assets. If we
	were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited
	partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the
	distribution that the distribution was in violation of the
	Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to us for the
	amount of the distribution for three years. In addition, the
	terms of our credit facility or other financing arrangements may
	from time to time include covenants or other restrictions that
	could constrain our ability to make distributions.


	 




	We will be required to pay our existing owners for most of
	the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or
	amortization deductions that we may claim as a result of the tax
	basis

	step-up

	we
	receive in connection with subsequent sales or exchanges of
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units and related transactions. In
	certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement with
	our existing owners may be accelerated

	and/or

	significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize and our
	ability to make payments under the tax receivable agreement may
	be limited by our structure.




	 


	Holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings (other than The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s

	wholly-owned

	subsidiaries), subject to the vesting and minimum retained
	ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to
	such holders as set forth in the partnership agreements of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships, may on a quarterly basis, from
	and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of
	this offering (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement),
	exchange their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for The
	Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis. In addition, subject to certain requirements, CalPERS
	will generally be permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for common units from and after the closing of
	this offering and Mubadala will generally be entitled to
	exchange Carlyle Holdings partnerships units for common units
	following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering.
	Any common units received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such
	exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in
	Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. The exchanges are expected to result in
	increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets
	of Carlyle Holdings. These





	68








	 






	increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes)
	depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce
	the amount of tax that Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and any other
	entity which may in the future pay taxes and become obligated to
	make payments under the tax receivable agreement as described in
	the fourth succeeding paragraph below, which we refer to as the
	corporate taxpayers, would otherwise be required to
	pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of
	that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a
	challenge.


	 


	We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our
	existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate
	taxpayers to our existing owners of 85% of the amount of cash
	savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income
	tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers
	realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of
	certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax
	receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to
	payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment
	obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not
	of Carlyle Holdings. While the actual increase in tax basis, as
	well as the amount and timing of any payments under this
	agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors,
	including the timing of exchanges, the price of our common units
	at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges
	are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect
	that as a result of the size of the transfers and increases in
	the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle
	Holdings, the payments that we may make to our existing owners
	will be substantial. The payments under the tax receivable
	agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners
	continued ownership of us. In the event that The Carlyle Group
	L.P. or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not
	treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, these entities will also be obligated to
	make payments under the tax receivable agreement on the same
	basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers.


	 


	The tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes
	of control, or if, at any time, the corporate taxpayers elect an
	early termination of the tax receivable agreement, the corporate
	taxpayers obligations under the tax receivable agreement
	(with respect to all Carlyle Holdings partnership units whether
	or not previously exchanged) would be calculated by reference to
	the value of all future payments that our existing owners would
	have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement
	using certain valuation assumptions, including that the
	corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income to
	fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax
	deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering
	into the tax receivable agreement and, in the case of an early
	termination election, that any Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the
	market value of the common units at the time of termination. In
	addition, our existing owners will not reimburse us for any
	payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if
	such tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the IRS.
	The corporate taxpayers ability to achieve benefits from
	any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under this
	agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the
	timing and amount of our future income. As a result, even in the
	absence of a change of control or an election to terminate the
	tax receivable agreement, payments to our existing owners under
	the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate
	taxpayers actual cash tax savings.


	 


	Accordingly, it is possible that the actual cash tax savings
	realized by the corporate taxpayers may be significantly less
	than the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments. There
	may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the
	payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual
	cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers realize in respect
	of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement

	and/or

	distributions to the corporate taxpayers by Carlyle Holdings are
	not sufficient to permit the corporate taxpayers to make
	payments under the tax receivable agreement after they have paid
	taxes and other expenses. Based upon certain assumptions
	described in greater detail below under Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Tax
	Receivable Agreement, we estimate that if the corporate
	taxpayers were to exercise their





	69








	 






	termination right immediately following this offering, the
	aggregate amount of these termination payments would be
	approximately $915.2 million. The foregoing number is
	merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ
	materially. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under
	the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources
	are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax
	receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or
	otherwise.


	 


	In the event that The Carlyle Group L.P. or any of its
	wholly-owned subsidiaries become taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, these entities will also
	be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement
	on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate
	taxpayers.


	 


	See Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Tax Receivable Agreement.


	 





	Our
	GAAP financial statements will reflect increased compensation
	and benefits expense and significant non-cash equity-based
	compensation charges following this offering.





	 


	Prior to this offering, our compensation and benefits expense
	has reflected compensation (primarily salary and bonus) solely
	to our employees who are not senior Carlyle professionals.
	Historically, all payments for services rendered by our senior
	Carlyle professionals have been accounted for as partnership
	distributions rather than as compensation and benefits expense.
	As a result, our consolidated financial statements have not
	reflected compensation and benefits expense for services
	rendered by these individuals. Following this offering, all of
	our senior Carlyle professionals and other employees will
	receive a base salary that will be paid by us and accounted for
	as compensation and benefits expense. Our senior Carlyle
	professionals and other employees are also eligible to receive
	discretionary cash bonuses based on the performance of Carlyle
	and the investments of the funds that we advise and other
	matters. The base salaries and any discretionary cash bonuses
	paid to our senior Carlyle professionals will be represented as
	compensation and benefits expense on our GAAP financials
	following the offering. In addition, as part of the
	Reorganization, our founders, CalPERS and Mubadala received
	177,238,323 Carlyle Holdings partnership units, all of which are
	vested, and our other existing owners received 96,761,677
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units, of which 56,760,336 are
	unvested and 40,001,341 are vested. In addition, we have granted
	unvested deferred restricted common units to our employees at
	the time of this offering with an aggregate value based on the
	initial public offering price per common unit of
	$375.3 million (17,056,935 deferred restricted common
	units). See Management  IPO Date Equity
	Awards. The grant date fair value of the unvested Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units and deferred restricted common units
	(which will be the initial public offering price per common unit
	in this offering) will be charged to expense as such units vest
	over the assumed service periods, which range up to six years,
	on a straight-line basis. The amortization of this non-cash
	equity-based compensation will increase our GAAP expenses
	substantially during the relevant periods and, as a result, we
	may record significant net losses for a number of years
	following this offering. See Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information and Managements Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
	for additional information.


	 





	If The
	Carlyle Group L.P. were deemed to be an investment
	company under the 1940 Act, applicable restrictions could
	make it impractical for us to continue our business as
	contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our
	business.





	 


	An entity generally will be deemed to be an investment
	company for purposes of the 1940 Act if:


	 












	 


	 


	it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or
	proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing,
	reinvesting or trading in securities; or




	 




	 


	 


	absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire
	investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value
	of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government
	securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.






	70








	 






	 


	We believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of
	providing asset management services and not in the business of
	investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We hold
	ourselves out as an asset management firm and do not propose to
	engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or
	trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that The
	Carlyle Group L.P. is, or following this offering will be, an
	orthodox investment company as defined in
	section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act and described in the
	first bullet point above. Furthermore, following this offering,
	The Carlyle Group L.P. will have no material assets other than
	its interests in certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, which in
	turn will have no material assets other than general partner
	interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. These
	wholly-owned subsidiaries will be the sole general partners of
	the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and will be vested with all
	management and control over the Carlyle Holdings partnerships.
	We do not believe that the equity interests of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. in its wholly-owned subsidiaries or the general partner
	interests of these wholly-owned subsidiaries in the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships are investment securities. Moreover,
	because we believe that the capital interests of the general
	partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither
	securities nor investment securities, we believe that less than
	40% of The Carlyle Group L.P.s total assets (exclusive of
	U.S. government securities and cash items) on an
	unconsolidated basis after this offering will be composed of
	assets that could be considered investment securities.
	Accordingly, we do not believe that The Carlyle Group L.P. is,
	or following this offering will be, an inadvertent investment
	company by virtue of the 40% test in section 3(a)(1)(C) of
	the 1940 Act as described in the second bullet point above. In
	addition, we believe that The Carlyle Group L.P. is not an
	investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 Act
	because it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company
	business.


	 


	The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed
	parameters for the organization and operation of investment
	companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules
	thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates,
	impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity
	securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and
	impose certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our
	operations so that The Carlyle Group L.P. will not be deemed to
	be an investment company under the 1940 Act. If anything were to
	happen which would cause The Carlyle Group L.P. to be deemed to
	be an investment company under the 1940 Act, requirements
	imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital
	structure, ability to transact business with affiliates
	(including us) and ability to compensate key employees, could
	make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently
	conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and
	among The Carlyle Group L.P., Carlyle Holdings and our senior
	Carlyle professionals, or any combination thereof, and
	materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
	and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to
	limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or
	otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject
	us to the registration and other requirements of the 1940 Act.


	 





	Changes
	in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) or other standard-setting
	bodies may adversely affect our financial
	statements.





	 


	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP as
	defined in the Accounting Standards Codification
	(ASC) of the FASB. From time to time, we are
	required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or
	guidance that are incorporated into the ASC. It is possible that
	future accounting standards we are required to adopt could
	change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our
	combined and consolidated financial statements and that such
	changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
	condition and results of operations.


	 


	In addition, the FASB is working on several projects with the
	International Accounting Standards Board, which could result in
	significant changes as GAAP converges with International
	Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including how
	our financial statements are presented. Furthermore, the SEC is
	considering whether and how to incorporate IFRS into the
	U.S. financial reporting system. The accounting changes
	being proposed by the FASB will be a complete change to how we
	account for and report significant areas of our business. The
	effective dates and transition





	71








	 






	methods are not known; however, issuers may be required to or
	may choose to adopt the new standards retrospectively. In this
	case, the issuer will report results under the new accounting
	method as of the effective date, as well as for all periods
	presented. The changes to GAAP and ultimate conversion to IFRS
	will impose special demands on issuers in the areas of
	governance, employee training, internal controls and disclosure
	and will likely affect how we manage our business, as it will
	likely affect other business processes such as the design of
	compensation plans.



	 




	Risks
	Related to Our Common Units and this Offering





	 





	There
	may not be an active trading market for our common units, which
	may cause our common units to trade at a discount from the
	initial offering price and make it difficult to sell the common
	units you purchase.





	 


	Prior to this offering, there has not been a public trading
	market for our common units. It is possible that after this
	offering an active trading market will not develop or continue
	or, if developed, that any market will not be sustained, which
	would make it difficult for you to sell your common units at an
	attractive price or at all. The initial public offering price
	per common unit will be determined by agreement among us and the
	representatives of the underwriters, and may not be indicative
	of the price at which our common units will trade in the public
	market after this offering.


	 





	The
	market price of our common units may decline due to the large
	number of common units eligible for exchange and future
	sale.





	 


	The market price of our common units could decline as a result
	of sales of a large number of common units in the market after
	the offering or the perception that such sales could occur.
	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also
	might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the
	future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. See
	Common Units Eligible for Future Sale. Subject to
	the

	lock-up

	restrictions described below, we may issue and sell in the
	future additional common units.


	 


	In addition, upon completion of this offering our existing
	owners will own an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units. Prior to this offering we have entered into
	an exchange agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships so that these holders, subject to the
	vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer
	restrictions applicable to such limited partners as set forth in
	the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships,
	may on a quarterly basis, from and after the first anniversary
	of the date of the closing of this offering (subject to the
	terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. The common units we issue upon such exchanges
	would be restricted securities, as defined in
	Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless we register such
	issuances. However, we will enter into one or more registration
	rights agreements with the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings
	that would require us to register these common units under the
	Securities Act. See Common Units Eligible for Future
	Sale  Registration Rights and Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
	Registration Rights Agreements. While the partnership
	agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and related





	72








	 






	agreements will contractually restrict our existing owners
	ability to transfer the Carlyle Holdings partnership units or
	The Carlyle Group L.P. common units they hold, these contractual
	provisions may lapse over time or be waived, modified or amended
	at any time. See Management  Vesting; Minimum
	Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer Restrictions.


	 


	Mubadala will have the ability to sell its equity interests
	(whether held in the form of common units, partnership units or
	otherwise) subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the
	subscription agreement described under Common Units
	Eligible for Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions.
	Except for the restrictions described under Common Units
	Eligible for Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer Restrictions,
	the Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by CalPERS are not
	subject to transfer restrictions. We have also agreed to provide
	Mubadala and CalPERS with registration rights to effect certain
	sales. See Common Units Eligible for Future
	Sale  Registration Rights.


	 


	Under our Equity Incentive Plan, we have granted to our
	employees at the time of this offering deferred restricted
	common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public
	offering price per common unit in this offering of
	$375.3 million (17,056,935 deferred restricted common
	units) and phantom deferred restricted common units with an
	aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per
	common unit in this offering of $8.0 million (362,875
	phantom deferred restricted common units). Additional common
	units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units will be available
	for future grant under our Equity Incentive Plan, which plan
	provides for automatic annual increases in the number of units
	available for future issuance. See Management 
	Equity Incentive Plan and  IPO Date Equity
	Awards. We have filed a registration statement and intend
	to file additional registration statements on

	Form S-8

	under the Securities Act to register common units or securities
	convertible into or exchangeable for common units issued or
	available for future grant under our Equity Incentive Plan
	(including pursuant to automatic annual increases). Any such

	Form S-8

	registration statement will automatically become effective upon
	filing. Accordingly, common units registered under such
	registration statement will be available for sale in the open
	market. The initial registration statement on

	Form S-8

	covered 30,450,000 common units.


	 


	In addition, our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an
	unlimited number of additional partnership securities and
	options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to
	partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms
	and conditions established by our general partner in its sole
	discretion without the approval of any limited partners. In
	accordance with the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the
	provisions of our partnership agreement, we may also issue
	additional partnership interests that have certain designations,
	preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from,
	and may be senior to, those applicable to common units.
	Similarly, the Carlyle Holdings partnership agreements authorize
	the wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P. which
	are the general partners of those partnerships to issue an
	unlimited number of additional partnership securities of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships with such designations,
	preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from,
	and may be senior to, those applicable to the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units, and which may be exchangeable for our common
	units.


	 





	If
	securities or industry analysts do not publish research or
	reports about our business, or if they downgrade their
	recommendations regarding our common units, our stock price and
	trading volume could decline.





	 


	The trading market for our common units will be influenced by
	the research and reports that industry or securities analysts
	publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who
	cover us downgrades our common units or publishes inaccurate or
	unfavorable research about our business, our common unit stock
	price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to
	regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the
	financial markets, which in turn could cause our common unit
	stock price or trading volume to decline and our common units to
	be less liquid.




	73








	 









	The
	market price of our common units may be volatile, which could
	cause the value of your investment to decline.





	 


	Even if a trading market develops, the market price of our
	common units may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide
	fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience
	significant price and volume fluctuations. This market
	volatility, as well as general economic, market or political
	conditions, could reduce the market price of common units in
	spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating
	results could be below the expectations of public market
	analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors,
	including variations in our quarterly operating results or
	distributions to unitholders, additions or departures of key
	management personnel, failure to meet analysts earnings
	estimates, publication of research reports about our industry,
	litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed
	changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or
	enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market
	reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may
	issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar
	companies or speculation in the press or investment community,
	announcements by our competitors of significant contracts,
	acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint
	ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the
	industries in which we participate or individual scandals, and
	in response the market price of our common units could decrease
	significantly. You may be unable to resell your common units at
	or above the initial public offering price.


	 


	In the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme
	price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of
	volatility in the overall market and the market price of a
	companys securities, securities class action litigation
	has often been instituted against public companies. This type of
	litigation, if instituted against us, could result in
	substantial costs and a diversion of our managements
	attention and resources.


	 





	You
	will suffer dilution in the net tangible book value of the
	common units you purchase.





	 


	The initial public offering price per common unit is
	substantially higher than our pro forma net tangible book value
	per common unit immediately after this offering. As a result,
	you will pay a price per common unit that substantially exceeds
	the book value of our total tangible assets after subtracting
	our total liabilities. At the initial public offering price of
	$22.00 per common unit, you will incur immediate dilution in an
	amount of $19.82 per common unit, assuming that the underwriters
	do not exercise their option to purchase additional common
	units. See Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Exchange Agreement and
	Dilution.



	 




	Risks
	Related to U.S. Taxation





	 





	Our
	structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax
	law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available.
	Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial
	or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly
	on a retroactive basis.





	 


	The U.S. federal income tax treatment of common unitholders
	depends in some instances on determinations of fact and
	interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal
	income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be
	available. You should be aware that the U.S. federal income
	tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the
	legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury
	Department, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of
	established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to
	regulations and other modifications and interpretations. The IRS
	pays close attention to the proper application of tax laws to
	partnerships. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment
	of an investment in our common units may be modified by
	administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any
	time, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such action may
	affect investments and commitments previously made. Changes to
	the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations
	thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the
	exception for us to be treated as a partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a
	corporation (referred to as the Qualifying Income
	Exception), affect or cause us to change our investments
	and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment
	in us,





	74








	 






	change the character or treatment of portions of our income
	(including, for instance, the treatment of carried interest as
	ordinary income rather than capital gain) and adversely affect
	an investment in our common units. For example, as discussed
	above under  Risks Related to Our
	Company Although not enacted, the U.S. Congress
	has considered legislation that would have: (i) in some
	cases after a ten-year transition period, precluded us from
	qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	or required us to hold carried interest through taxable
	subsidiary corporations; and (ii) taxed certain income and
	gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be
	enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related
	to our business, as well as our distributions to you and the
	market price of our common units, could be reduced, the
	U.S. Congress has considered various legislative proposals
	to treat all or part of the capital gain and dividend income
	that is recognized by an investment partnership and allocable to
	a partner affiliated with the sponsor of the partnership (i.e.,
	a portion of the carried interest) as ordinary income to such
	partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	 


	Our organizational documents and governing agreements will
	permit our general partner to modify our limited partnership
	agreement from time to time, without the consent of the common
	unitholders, to address certain changes in U.S. federal
	income tax regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some
	circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse
	impact on some or all common unitholders. For instance, our
	general partner could elect at some point to treat us as an
	association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and
	applicable state) income tax purposes. If our general partner
	were to do this, the U.S. federal income tax consequences
	of owning our common units would be materially different.
	Moreover, we will apply certain assumptions and conventions in
	an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income,
	gain, deduction, loss and credit to common unitholders in a
	manner that reflects such common unitholders beneficial
	ownership of partnership items, taking into account variation in
	ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading
	activity. As a result, a common unitholder transferring units
	may be allocated income, gain, loss and deductions realized
	after the date of transfer. However, those assumptions and
	conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of
	applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the IRS will
	assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by
	us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal
	Revenue Code

	and/or

	Treasury regulations and could require that items of income,
	gain, deductions, loss or credit, including interest deductions,
	be adjusted, reallocated or disallowed in a manner that
	adversely affects common unitholders.


	 





	If we
	were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax or
	state tax purposes or otherwise became subject to additional
	entity level taxation (including as a result of changes to
	current law), then our distributions to you would be
	substantially reduced and the value of our common units would be
	adversely affected.





	 


	The value of your investment in us depends in part on our being
	treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, which requires that 90% or more of our gross income
	for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined
	in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code and that our
	partnership not be registered under the 1940 Act. Qualifying
	income generally includes dividends, interest, capital gains
	from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities and
	certain other forms of investment income. We may not meet these
	requirements or current law may change so as to cause, in either
	event, us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes or otherwise subject to U.S. federal
	income tax. Moreover, the anticipated after-tax benefit of an
	investment in our common units depends largely on our being
	treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a
	ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us.


	 


	If we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our
	taxable income at the applicable tax rates. In addition, we
	would likely be liable for state and local income

	and/or

	franchise tax on all our income. Distributions to you would
	generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no
	income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would otherwise
	flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon





	75








	 






	us as a corporation, our distributions to you would be
	substantially reduced which would cause a reduction in the value
	of our common units.


	 


	Current law may change, causing us to be treated as a
	corporation for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes
	or otherwise subjecting us to additional entity level taxation.
	See  Risks Related to Our
	Company Although not enacted, the U.S. Congress
	has considered legislation that would have: (i) in some
	cases after a ten-year transition period, precluded us from
	qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	or required us to hold carried interest through taxable
	subsidiary corporations; and (ii) taxed certain income and
	gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be
	enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related
	to our business, as well as our distributions to you and the
	market price of our common units, could be reduced. For
	example, because of widespread state budget deficits, several
	states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity
	level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise
	or other forms of taxation. If any state were to impose a tax
	upon us as an entity, our distributions to you would be reduced.


	 





	You
	will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on your share of our
	taxable income, regardless of whether you receive any cash
	distributions from us.





	 


	As long as 90% of our gross income for each taxable year
	constitutes qualifying income as defined in Section 7704 of
	the Internal Revenue Code and we are not required to register as
	an investment company under the 1940 Act on a continuing basis,
	and assuming there is no change in law, we will be treated, for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not
	as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
	corporation. Accordingly, you will be required to take into
	account your allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss
	and deduction. Distributions to you generally will be taxable
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent the
	amount distributed exceeds your tax basis in the common unit.
	That treatment contrasts with the treatment of a shareholder in
	a corporation. For example, a shareholder in a corporation who
	receives a distribution of earnings from the corporation
	generally will report the distribution as dividend income for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. In contrast, a holder of
	our common units who receives a distribution of earnings from us
	will not report the distribution as dividend income (and will
	treat the distribution as taxable only to the extent the amount
	distributed exceeds the unitholders tax basis in the
	common units), but will instead report the holders
	allocable share of items of our income for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. As a result, you may be subject to
	U.S. federal, state, local and possibly, in some cases,
	foreign income taxation on your allocable share of our items of
	income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including our
	allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest
	that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax
	on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending
	with or within your taxable years, regardless of whether or not
	you receive cash distributions from us. See Material
	U.S. Federal Tax Considerations. See also
	 Risks Related to Our
	Company Although not enacted, the U.S. Congress
	has considered legislation that would have: (i) in some
	cases after a ten-year transition period, precluded us from
	qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	or required us to hold carried interest through taxable
	subsidiary corporations; and (ii) taxed certain income and
	gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be
	enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related
	to our business, as well as our distributions to you and the
	market price of our common units, could be reduced.


	 


	You may not receive cash distributions equal to your allocable
	share of our net taxable income or even the tax liability that
	results from that income. In addition, certain of our holdings,
	including holdings, if any, in a controlled foreign corporation
	(CFC) and a passive foreign investment company
	(PFIC) may produce taxable income prior to the
	receipt of cash relating to such income, and common unitholders
	that are U.S. taxpayers will be required to take such
	income into account in determining their taxable income. In the
	event of an inadvertent termination of our partnership status
	for which the IRS has granted us limited relief, each holder of
	our common units may be obligated to make such adjustments as
	the IRS may require to maintain our status as a partnership.





	76








	 






	Such adjustments may require persons holding our common units to
	recognize additional amounts in income during the years in which
	they hold such units.


	 





	The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s interest in certain of our businesses
	will be held through Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which will be
	treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
	such corporation may be liable for significant taxes and may
	create other adverse tax consequences, which could potentially
	adversely affect the value of your investment.





	 


	In light of the publicly-traded partnership rules under
	U.S. federal income tax law and other requirements, The
	Carlyle Group L.P. will hold its interest in certain of our
	businesses through Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which will be
	treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. Such corporation could be liable for significant
	U.S. federal income taxes and applicable state, local and
	other taxes that would not otherwise be incurred, which could
	adversely affect the value of your investment. Those additional
	taxes have not applied to our existing owners in our
	organizational structure in effect before this offering and will
	not apply to our existing owners following this offering to the
	extent they own equity interests directly or indirectly in the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships.


	 





	Complying
	with certain tax-related requirements may cause us to invest
	through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate
	income tax or enter into acquisitions, borrowings, financings or
	arrangements we may not have otherwise entered
	into.





	 


	In order for us to be treated as a partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as an association
	or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, we must
	meet the Qualifying Income Exception discussed above on a
	continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an
	investment company under the 1940 Act. In order to effect such
	treatment, we (or our subsidiaries) may be required to invest
	through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate
	income tax, forgo attractive investment opportunities or enter
	into acquisitions, borrowings, financings or other transactions
	we may not have otherwise entered into. This may adversely
	affect our ability to operate solely to maximize our cash flow.


	 


	Our structure also may impede our ability to engage in certain
	corporate acquisitive transactions because we generally intend
	to hold all of our assets through the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships. In addition, we may be unable to participate in
	certain corporate reorganization transactions that would be
	tax-free to our common unit holders if we were a corporation.


	 





	Tax
	gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or
	less than expected.





	 


	If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss
	equal to the difference between the amount realized and the
	adjusted tax basis in those common units. Prior distributions to
	you in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to you,
	which decreased the tax basis in your common units, will in
	effect become taxable income to you if the common units are sold
	at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units,
	even if the price is less than the original cost. A portion of
	the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be
	ordinary income to you.


	 





	Because
	we do not intend to make, or cause to be made, an otherwise
	available election under Section 754 of the Internal
	Revenue Code to adjust our asset basis or the asset basis of
	certain of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, a holder of common
	units could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those
	common units prior to disposition than if we had made such an
	election.





	 


	We currently do not intend to make, or cause to be made, an
	election to adjust asset basis under Section 754 of the
	Internal Revenue Code with respect to us or Carlyle
	Holdings II L.P. If no such election is made, there
	generally will be no adjustment to the basis of the assets of
	Carlyle Holdings II L.P. upon our acquisition of interests
	in Carlyle Holdings II L.P. in connection with this
	offering, or to our assets or to the assets of Carlyle
	Holdings II L.P. upon a subsequent transferees
	acquisition of common units from a prior holder of such common
	units, even if the purchase price for those interests or units,
	as applicable, is greater than the share of the aggregate tax
	basis of our





	77








	 






	assets or the assets of Carlyle Holdings II L.P.
	attributable to those interests or units immediately prior to
	the acquisition. Consequently, upon a sale of an asset by us,
	Carlyle Holdings II L.P., gain allocable to a holder of
	common units could include built-in gain in the asset existing
	at the time we acquired those interests, or such holder acquired
	such units, which built-in gain would otherwise generally be
	eliminated if we had made a Section 754 election. See
	Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations 
	Consequences to U.S. Holders of Common Units 
	Section 754 Election.


	 






	Non-U.S.

	persons face unique U.S. tax issues from owning common units
	that may result in adverse tax consequences to
	them.





	 


	In light of our intended investment activities, we generally do
	not expect to generate significant amounts of income treated as
	effectively connected income with respect to

	non-U.S. holders

	of our common units (ECI). However, there can be no
	assurance that we will not generate ECI currently or in the
	future and, subject to the qualifying income rules described
	under Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations  Taxation of our Partnership and the
	Carlyle Holdings Partnerships, we are under no obligation
	to minimize ECI. To the extent our income is treated as ECI,

	non-U.S. holders

	generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable
	shares of such income, would be required to file a
	U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting
	their allocable shares of income effectively connected with such
	trade or business and any other income treated as ECI, and would
	be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular
	U.S. tax rates on any such income (state and local income
	taxes and filings may also apply in that event). In addition,
	certain income of

	non-U.S. holders

	from U.S. sources not connected to any such U.S. trade
	or business conducted by us could be treated as ECI.

	Non-U.S. holders

	that are corporations may also be subject to a 30% branch
	profits tax on their allocable share of such income. In
	addition, certain income from U.S. sources that is not ECI
	allocable to

	non-U.S. holders

	will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest
	effective applicable tax rate. A portion of any gain recognized
	by a

	non-U.S. holder

	on the sale or exchange of common units could also be treated as
	ECI.


	 





	Tax-exempt
	entities face unique tax issues from owning common units that
	may result in adverse tax consequences to them.





	 


	In light of our intended investment activities, we generally do
	not expect to make investments directly in operating businesses
	that generate significant amounts of unrelated business taxable
	income for tax-exempt holders of our common units
	(UBTI). However, certain of our investments may be
	treated as debt-financed investments, which may give rise to
	debt-financed UBTI. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
	we will not generate UBTI currently or in the future and,
	subject to the qualifying income rules described under
	Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations 
	Taxation of our Partnership and the Carlyle Holdings
	Partnerships, we are under no obligation to minimize UBTI.
	Consequently, a holder of common units that is a tax-exempt
	organization may be subject to unrelated business income
	tax to the extent that its allocable share of our income
	consists of UBTI. A tax-exempt partner of a partnership could be
	treated as earning UBTI if the partnership regularly engages in
	a trade or business that is unrelated to the exempt function of
	the tax-exempt partner, if the partnership derives income from
	debt-financed property or if the partnership interest itself is

	debt-financed.



	 





	We
	cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, and we
	will therefore adopt certain income tax accounting positions
	that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax
	requirements. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could
	adversely affect the value of our common units.





	 


	Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common
	units, we will adopt depreciation, amortization and other tax
	accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of
	existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to
	those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax
	benefits available to our common unitholders. It also could
	affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on
	the sale of common units and could have a negative





	78








	 






	impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of
	and adjustments to our common unitholders tax returns.


	 


	In addition, our taxable income and losses will be determined
	and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as
	consistent with applicable law. As a result, if you transfer
	your common units, you may be allocated income, gain, loss and
	deduction realized by us after the date of transfer. Similarly,
	a transferee may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction
	realized by us prior to the date of the transferees
	acquisition of our common units. A transferee may also bear the
	cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated
	to a transferor through a reduction in the cash distributed to
	the transferee.


	 


	The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit
	interests will result in the termination of our partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to
	have been terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total
	interests in our capital and profits within a

	twelve-month

	period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the
	closing of our taxable year for all common unitholders and could
	result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in
	computing our taxable income. See Material
	U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for a description of
	the consequences of our termination for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes.


	 





	Common
	unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return
	filing requirements as a result of investing in our common
	units.





	 


	In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our common
	unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and
	local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate,
	inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various
	jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in
	the future, even if our common unitholders do not reside in any
	of those jurisdictions. Our common unitholders may also be
	required to file state and local income tax returns and pay
	state and local income taxes in some or all of these
	jurisdictions. Further, common unitholders may be subject to
	penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is
	the responsibility of each common unitholder to file all
	U.S. federal, state and local tax returns that may be
	required of such common unitholder. Our counsel has not rendered
	an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an
	investment in our common units.


	 





	We may
	not be able to furnish to each unitholder specific tax
	information within 90 days after the close of each calendar
	year, which means that holders of common units who are U.S.
	taxpayers should anticipate the need to file annually a request
	for an extension of the due date of their income tax return. In
	addition, it is possible that common unitholders may be required
	to file amended income tax returns.





	 


	As a publicly traded partnership, our operating results,
	including distributions of income, dividends, gains, losses or
	deductions and adjustments to carrying basis, will be reported
	on

	Schedule K-1

	and distributed to each unitholder annually. Although we
	currently intend to distribute

	Schedule K-1s

	on or around 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, it
	may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal
	year to obtain the requisite information from all lower-tier
	entities so that K-1s may be prepared for us. For this reason,
	holders of common units who are U.S. taxpayers should
	anticipate that they may need to file annually with the IRS (and
	certain states) a request for an extension past April 15 or the
	otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the
	taxable year. See Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations  Administrative Matters 
	Information Returns.


	 


	In addition, it is possible that a common unitholder will be
	required to file amended income tax returns as a result of
	adjustments to items on the corresponding income tax returns of
	the partnership. Any obligation for a common unitholder to file
	amended income tax returns for that or





	79








	 






	any other reason, including any costs incurred in the
	preparation or filing of such returns, are the responsibility of
	each common unitholder.


	 





	We may
	hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified
	as a PFIC or CFC for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes.





	 


	Certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may
	be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be
	classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. Such an entity may be a PFIC or a CFC for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. U.S. holders of common units
	indirectly owning an interest in a PFIC or a CFC may experience
	adverse U.S. tax consequences. See Material
	U.S. Federal Tax Considerations  Consequences to
	U.S. Holders of Common

	Units  Passive Foreign Investment Companies and
	 Consequences to U.S. Holders of Common Units
	Controlled Foreign Companies for additional information
	regarding such consequences.


	 





	Changes
	in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise
	funds from certain foreign investors.





	 


	Under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
	(FATCA), following the expiration of an initial
	phase in-period, a broadly defined class of foreign financial
	institutions are required to comply with a complicated and
	expansive reporting regime or be subject to certain
	U.S. withholding taxes. The reporting obligations imposed
	under FATCA require foreign financial institutions to enter into
	agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about
	certain account holders and investors to the IRS. Additionally,
	certain

	non-U.S. entities

	that are not foreign financial institutions are required to
	provide certain certifications or other information regarding
	their U.S. beneficial ownership or be subject to certain
	U.S. withholding taxes. Although administrative guidance
	and proposed regulations have been issued, regulations
	implementing FATCA have not yet been finalized and it is
	difficult to determine at this time what impact any such
	guidance may have. Thus, some foreign investors may hesitate to
	invest in U.S. funds until there is more certainty around
	FATCA implementation. In addition, the administrative and
	economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some
	foreign investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could
	adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors.

	ORGANIZATIONAL
	STRUCTURE






	 




	Our
	Current Organizational Structure





	 


	Our business has historically been owned by four holding
	entities: TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group
	Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment
	Holdings, L.P. We refer to these four holding entities
	collectively as the Parent Entities. The Parent
	Entities have been under the common ownership and control of the
	partners of our firm (who we refer to as our senior
	Carlyle professionals) and two strategic investors that
	own minority interests in our business  entities
	affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, an Abu-Dhabi based
	strategic development and investment company
	(Mubadala), and California Public Employees
	Retirement System (CalPERS). In addition, certain
	individuals engaged in our businesses own interests in the
	general partners of our existing carry funds. Certain of these
	individuals have contributed a portion of these interests to
	Carlyle Holdings as part of the reorganization. We refer to
	these individuals, together with the owners of the Parent
	Entities prior to this offering, collectively as our
	existing owners.


	 


	The diagram below depicts our historical organizational
	structure.


	 





	 




	 













	(1)






	Certain individuals engaged in our
	business own interests directly in selected subsidiaries of the
	Parent Entities.






	 




	Our
	Organizational Structure Following this Offering





	 


	Following the reorganization and this offering, The Carlyle
	Group L.P. is a holding partnership and, through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries, holds equity interests in three Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships (which we refer to collectively as Carlyle
	Holdings), which in turn own the four Parent Entities. The
	Carlyle Group L.P. was formed as a Delaware limited partnership
	on July 18, 2011. The Carlyle Group L.P. has not engaged in
	any other business or other activities except in connection with
	the Reorganization and the Offering Transactions described
	below. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The Carlyle Group
	L.P. is the sole general partner of each of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships. Accordingly, The Carlyle Group L.P. will operate
	and control all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings
	and will consolidate the financial results of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the
	ownership interest of the limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships will be reflected as a non-controlling
	interest in The Carlyle Group L.P.s consolidated financial
	statements. At the time of this offering, our existing owners
	are the only limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships.




	82








	 






	The diagram below (which omits certain wholly-owned intermediate
	holding companies) depicts our organizational structure
	immediately following this offering. As discussed in greater
	detail below and in this section, The Carlyle Group L.P. will
	hold, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units that is equal to the number of common
	units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued and will benefit
	from the income of Carlyle Holdings to the extent of its equity
	interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. While the
	holders of common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. will be
	entitled to all of the economic rights in The Carlyle Group L.P.
	immediately following this offering, our existing owners will,
	like the wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P.,
	hold Carlyle Holdings partnership units that entitle them to
	economic rights in Carlyle Holdings to the extent of their
	equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Public
	investors will not directly hold equity interests in the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships.


	 





	 




	 













	(1)






	The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	unitholders will have only limited voting rights and will have
	no right to remove our general partner or, except in limited
	circumstances, elect the directors of our general partner. TCG
	Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly-owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals, will hold a special voting unit in
	The Carlyle Group L.P. that will entitle it, on those few
	matters that may be submitted for a vote of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. common unitholders, to participate in the vote on the same
	basis as the common unitholders and provide it with a number of
	votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and
	unvested partnership units in Carlyle Holdings held by the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings on the relevant record
	date. See Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	Partnership Agreement  Withdrawal or Removal of the
	General Partner,  Meetings; Voting
	and  Election of Directors of General
	Partner.





	 





	(2)






	Certain individuals engaged in our
	business will continue to own interests directly in selected
	operating subsidiaries including, in certain instances, entities
	that receive management fees from funds that we advise. The
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships will also directly own interests
	in selected operating subsidiaries. For additional information
	concerning these interests see  Our Organizational
	Structure Following this Offering  Certain
	Non-controlling Interests in Operating Subsidiaries.







	83








	 






	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. intends to conduct all of its material
	business activities through Carlyle Holdings. Each of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships was formed to hold our interests
	in different businesses. We expect that Carlyle Holdings I L.P.
	will own all of our U.S. fee-generating businesses and many
	of our

	non-U.S. fee-generating

	businesses, as well as our carried interests (and other
	investment interests) that are expected to derive income that
	would not be qualifying income for purposes of the
	U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules
	and certain of our carried interests (and other investment
	interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of
	corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities
	that are pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	We anticipate that Carlyle Holdings II L.P. will hold a
	variety of assets, including our carried interests in many of
	the investments by our carry funds in entities that are treated
	as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes and in certain

	non-U.S. entities.

	Certain of our

	non-U.S. fee-generating

	businesses, as well as our non-U.S. carried interests (and other
	investment interests) that are expected to derive income that
	would not be qualifying income for purposes of the U.S. federal
	income tax publicly-traded partnership rules and certain of our
	non-U.S. carried interests (and other investment interests) that
	do not relate to investments in stock of corporations or in
	debt, such as equity investments in entities that are
	pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be held
	by Carlyle Holdings III L.P.


	 


	Accordingly, following the reorganization, subsidiaries of
	Carlyle Holdings generally will be entitled to:


	 












	 


	 


	all management fees payable in respect of all current and future
	investment funds that we advise, as well as the fees for
	transaction advisory and oversight services that may be payable
	by these investment funds portfolio companies (subject to
	certain third-party interests, as described below);




	 




	 


	 


	all carried interest earned in respect of all current and future
	carry funds that we advise (subject to certain third-party
	interests, including those described below and to the allocation
	to our investment professionals who work in these operations of
	a portion of this carried interest as described below);




	 




	 


	 


	all incentive fees (subject to certain interests in Claren Road
	and ESG and, with respect to other funds earning incentive fees,
	any performance-related allocations to investment
	professionals); and




	 




	 


	 


	all returns on investments of our own balance sheet capital that
	we make following this offering (as well as on existing
	investments with an aggregate value of approximately
	$249.3 million as of December 31, 2011).




	 



	Certain Non-controlling Interests in Operating
	Subsidiaries.

	  In certain cases, the entities that
	receive management fees from our investment funds are owned by
	Carlyle together with other persons. For example, management
	fees from our energy and renewables funds are received by an
	entity we own together with Riverstone, and the Claren Road, ESG
	and AlpInvest management companies are partially owned by the
	respective founders and managers of these businesses. We may
	have similar arrangements with respect to the ownership of the
	entities that advise our funds in the future. In addition, in
	order to better align the interests of our senior Carlyle
	professionals and the other individuals who manage our carry
	funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in
	these funds, such individuals are allocated directly a portion
	of the carried interest in our carry funds. Prior to the
	reorganization, the level of such allocations vary by fund, but
	generally are at least 50% of the carried interests in the fund.
	As a result of the reorganization, the allocations to these
	individuals will be approximately 45% of all carried interest,
	on a blended average basis, earned in respect of investments
	made prior to the date of the reorganization and approximately
	45% of any carried interest that we earn in respect of
	investments made from and after the date of the reorganization,
	in each case with the exception of the Riverstone funds, where
	we will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are
	entitled under our arrangements for those funds. In addition,
	under our arrangements with the historical owners and management
	team of AlpInvest, such persons are allocated all carried
	interest in respect of the historical investments and
	commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of
	December 31, 2010, 85% of the carried





	84








	 






	interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of
	AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 60% of the
	carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including
	all future commitments from third parties). See
	Business  Structure and Operation of Our
	Investment Funds  Incentive Arrangements/Fee
	Structure.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. has formed wholly-owned subsidiaries to
	serve as the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships: Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., Carlyle
	Holdings II GP L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P.
	We refer to Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., Carlyle Holdings II
	GP L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. collectively as
	the Carlyle Holdings General Partners. Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc. is a newly-formed Delaware corporation that
	is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes; Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. is a newly-formed
	Delaware limited liability company that is a disregarded entity
	and not an association taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes; and Carlyle
	Holdings III GP L.P. is a newly-formed Québec

	société en commandite

	that is a foreign
	corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. will serve
	as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and Carlyle
	Holdings III L.P., respectively, indirectly through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries that are disregarded for federal income tax
	purposes. See Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations  Taxation of our Partnership and the
	Carlyle Holdings Partnerships for more information about
	the tax treatment of The Carlyle Group L.P. and Carlyle Holdings.


	 


	Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will have an identical
	number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms
	Carlyle Holdings partnership unit or
	partnership unit in/of Carlyle Holdings to refer
	collectively to a partnership unit in each of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. will hold, through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units equal to the number of common units that The
	Carlyle Group L.P. has issued. The Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units that will be held by The Carlyle Group L.P.s
	wholly-owned subsidiaries will be economically identical in all
	respects to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units that will be
	held by our existing owners. Accordingly, the income of Carlyle
	Holdings will benefit The Carlyle Group L.P. to the extent of
	its equity interest in Carlyle Holdings.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. is managed and operated by our general
	partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., to whom we refer as
	our general partner, which is in turn wholly-owned
	by our senior Carlyle professionals. Our general partner will
	not have any business activities other than managing and
	operating us. We will reimburse our general partner and its
	affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us,
	and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner
	will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. Although
	there are no ceilings on the expenses for which we will
	reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, the expenses
	to which they may be entitled to reimbursement from us, such as
	director fees, are not expected to be material.


	 


	Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our common
	unitholders will have only limited voting rights and will have
	no right to remove our general partner or, except in the limited
	circumstances described below, elect the directors of our
	general partner. In addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners
	L.L.C., an entity wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle
	professionals, will hold a special voting unit that provides it
	with a number of votes on any matter that may be submitted for a
	vote of our common unitholders that is equal to the aggregate
	number of vested and unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	held by the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings. We refer to
	our common units (other than those held by any person whom our
	general partner may from time to time with such persons
	consent designate as a non-voting common unitholder) and our
	special voting units as voting units. Our common
	unitholders voting rights will be further restricted by
	the provision in our partnership agreement stating that any
	common units held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more
	of any class of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then
	outstanding (other than our general partner and its affiliates,
	or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general
	partner or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any matter.




	85








	 






	In general, our common unitholders will have no right to elect
	the directors of our general partner. However, when our Senior
	Carlyle professionals and other

	then-current

	or former Carlyle personnel hold less than 10% of the limited
	partner voting power, our common unitholders will have the right
	to vote in the election of the directors of our general partner.
	This voting power condition will be measured on January 31 of
	each year, and will be triggered if the total voting power held
	by holders of the special voting units in The Carlyle Group L.P.
	(including voting units held by our general partner and its
	affiliates) in their capacity as such, or otherwise held by
	then-current or former Carlyle personnel (treating voting units
	deliverable to such persons pursuant to outstanding equity
	awards as being held by them), collectively, constitutes less
	than 10% of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. See Material Provisions of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership Agreement  Election of
	Directors of General Partner. Unless and until the
	foregoing voting power condition is satisfied, our general
	partners board of directors will be elected in accordance
	with its limited liability company agreement, which provides
	that directors may be appointed and removed by members of our
	general partner holding a majority in interest of the voting
	power of the members, which voting power is allocated to each
	member ratably according to his or her aggregate ownership of
	our common units and partnership units. See Material
	Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement  Election of Directors of General
	Partner.



	 




	Reorganization





	 



	Restructuring of Certain Third Party
	Interests

	.  Certain existing and former owners of
	the Parent Entities (including CalPERS and former and current
	senior Carlyle professionals) have beneficial interests in
	investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such
	persons indirectly through the Parent Entities. In order to
	minimize the extent of

	third-party

	ownership interests in firm assets, prior to the completion of
	the offering we have (i) distributed a portion of these
	interests (approximately $118.5 million as of
	December 31, 2011) to the beneficial owners so that
	they are held directly by such persons and are no longer
	consolidated in our financial statements and
	(ii) restructured the remainder of these interests
	(approximately $84.8 million as of December 31,
	2011) so that they are reflected as non-controlling
	interests in our financial statements. In addition, prior to the
	offering the Parent Entities have restructured ownership of
	certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior
	Carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will
	be reflected as non-controlling interests in our financial
	statements. Such restructured carried interest rights accounted
	for approximately $42.3 million of our performance fee
	revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. See
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.


	 



	Distribution of Earnings.

	  During 2012, in the
	ordinary course of business, we have made distributions to our
	existing owners, including distributions sourced from realized
	carried interest and incentive fees. Prior to the date of the
	offering the Parent Entities have also made to their owners a
	cash distribution of previously undistributed earnings totaling
	$28.0 million. This distribution enabled the existing
	owners to realize, in part, the earnings accumulated by our
	business during the period of their ownership prior to this
	offering.


	 



	Contribution of the Parent Entities and Other Interests to
	Carlyle Holdings.

	  Prior to the completion of this
	offering:


	 












	 


	 


	our senior Carlyle professionals, Mubadala and CalPERS
	contributed all of their interests in:




	 












	 


	

	our senior Carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged
	in our business contributed to the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	a portion of the equity interests they own in the general
	partners of our existing carry funds.






	86








	 






	 


	In consideration of these contributions our existing owners
	received an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units.


	 


	Under the terms of the partnership agreements of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships, all of the Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units received by our existing owners in the reorganization are
	subject to restrictions on transfer and, with the exception of
	Mubadala and CalPERS, minimum retained ownership requirements.
	All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units received by our
	founders, CalPERS and Mubadala as part of the Reorganization are
	fully vested. All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	received by our other existing owners in exchange for their
	interests in carried interest owned at the fund level relating
	to investments made by our carry funds prior to the date of
	Reorganization are fully vested. Of the remaining Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units received as part of the
	Reorganization by our other existing owners, 26.2% are fully
	vested and 73.8% are not vested and, with specified exceptions,
	will be subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be
	employed by us prior to vesting. Holders of our Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units (other than Mubadala and CalPERS), including
	our founders and our other senior Carlyle professionals, will be
	prohibited from transferring or exchanging any such units until
	the fifth anniversary of this offering without our consent. See
	Management  Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership
	Requirements and Transfer Restrictions. The Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units held by Mubadala and CalPERS will be
	subject to transfer restrictions as described below under
	Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements.


	 


	We refer to the above-described restructuring and purchase of
	third-party interests, distribution of earnings and contribution
	of the Parent Entities and other interests to Carlyle Holdings,
	collectively, as the Reorganization.


	 





	Exchange
	Agreement; Tax Receivable Agreement





	 


	At the time of this offering, we have entered into an exchange
	agreement with limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships so that these holders, subject to the vesting and
	minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer
	restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships, will have the right on a
	quarterly basis, from and after the first anniversary date of
	the closing of this offering (subject to the terms of the
	exchange agreement), to exchange their Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale  Lock-Up
	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. As the number of Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships declines, the number of votes to which TCG Carlyle
	Global Partners L.L.C. is entitled as a result of its ownership
	of the special voting unit will be correspondingly reduced. See
	Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Exchange Agreement.


	 


	Future exchanges of Carlyle Holdings partnership units are
	expected to result in transfers of and increases in the tax
	basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings,
	primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in
	our business. These transfers and increases in tax basis will
	increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and
	therefore reduce the amount of tax that certain of our
	subsidiaries, including Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which we
	refer to as the corporate taxpayers, would otherwise
	be required to pay in the future. This increase in





	87








	 






	tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future
	dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis
	is allocated to those capital assets. We entered into a tax
	receivable agreement with our existing owners whereby the
	corporate taxpayers have agreed to pay to our existing owners
	85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in
	U.S. federal, state and local income tax or foreign or
	franchise tax that it realizes as a result of these increases in
	tax basis and, in limited cases, transfers or prior increases in
	tax basis. See Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Tax Receivable Agreement.



	 




	Offering
	Transactions





	 


	We estimate that the net proceeds to The Carlyle Group L.P. from
	this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts,
	will be approximately $639.1 million, or
	$735.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their
	option to purchase additional common units. The Carlyle Group
	L.P. intends to use all of these proceeds to purchase newly
	issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units from Carlyle Holdings.
	See Use of Proceeds. Accordingly, The Carlyle Group
	L.P. will hold, through the Carlyle Holdings general partners, a
	number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units equal to the
	aggregate number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has
	issued in connection with this offering from Carlyle Holdings.


	 


	At the time of this offering, we have granted to our employees
	deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based
	on the initial public offering price per common unit in this
	offering of approximately $375.3 million (17,056,935
	deferred restricted common units) and phantom deferred
	restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the
	initial public offering price per common unit in this offering
	of approximately $8.0 million (362,875 phantom deferred
	restricted common units). In addition, at the time of this
	offering, we have granted to our directors who are not employees
	of or advisors to Carlyle deferred restricted common units with
	an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price
	per common unit in this offering of approximately
	$1.3 million (56,820 deferred restricted common units). See
	Management  Director Compensation.
	Additional common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	will be available for future grant under our Equity Incentive
	Plan, which plan provides for automatic annual increases in the
	number of units available for future issuance. See
	Management  IPO Date Equity Awards.


	 


	We refer to the above described transactions as the
	Offering Transactions.


	 


	As a result, immediately following the Offering Transactions:


	 












	 


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
	will hold 30,500,000 partnership units in Carlyle Holdings (or
	35,075,000 partnership units if the underwriters exercise in
	full their option to purchase additional common units) and will,
	through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, be the sole general
	partner of each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and,
	through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, operate the
	Contributed Businesses;




	 




	 


	 


	our existing owners will hold 217,239,664 vested partnership
	units and 56,760,336 unvested partnership units in Carlyle
	Holdings, and more specifically:




	 












	 


	 


	our founders, CalPERS and Mubadala will hold 177,238,323 vested
	partnership units; and




	 




	 


	 


	our other existing owners will hold 40,001,341 vested
	partnership units and 56,760,336 unvested partnership units;




	 












	 


	 


	investors in this offering will hold 30,500,000 common units (or
	35,075,000 common units if the underwriters exercise in full
	their option to purchase additional common units); and




	 




	 


	 


	on those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the
	limited partners of The Carlyle Group L.P., such as the approval
	of amendments to the limited partnership agreement of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. that the limited partnership agreement does
	not authorize our general







	88








	 
















	 




	partner to approve without the consent of the limited partners
	and the approval of certain mergers or sales of all or
	substantially all of our assets:




	 












	 


	 


	investors in this offering will collectively have 10.0% of the
	voting power of The Carlyle Group L.P. limited partners (or
	11.3% if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
	purchase additional common units) and




	 




	 


	 


	our existing owners will collectively have 90.0% of the voting
	power of The Carlyle Group L.P. limited partners (or 88.7% if
	the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
	additional common units).




	 


	These percentages correspond with the percentages of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units that will be held by The Carlyle
	Group L.P. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, on the one
	hand, and by our existing owners, on the other hand.



	 




	Holding
	Partnership Structure





	 


	As discussed in Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations, The Carlyle Group L.P. will be treated as
	a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. An entity that is treated as a partnership
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a taxable
	entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability.
	Instead, each partner is required to take into account its
	allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of
	the partnership in computing its U.S. federal income tax
	liability, regardless of whether or not cash distributions are
	made. Investors in this offering will become partners in The
	Carlyle Group L.P. Distributions of cash by a partnership to a
	partner are generally not taxable unless the amount of cash
	distributed to a partner is in excess of the partners
	adjusted basis in its partnership interest. However, our
	partnership agreement does not restrict our ability to take
	actions that may result in our being treated as an entity
	taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable
	state) income tax purposes. See Material U.S. Federal
	Tax Considerations for a summary discussing certain
	U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the
	purchase, ownership and disposition of our common units as of
	the date of this prospectus.


	 


	We believe that the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will also be
	treated as partnerships and not as corporations for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the holders
	of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings, including The Carlyle
	Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries, will incur
	U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their
	proportionate share of any net taxable income of Carlyle
	Holdings. Net profits and net losses of Carlyle Holdings
	generally will be allocated to its partners (including The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries) pro rata in
	accordance with the percentages of their respective partnership
	interests. Because The Carlyle Group L.P. will indirectly own
	10.0% of the total partnership units in Carlyle Holdings (or
	11.3% if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
	purchase additional common units), The Carlyle Group L.P. will
	indirectly be allocated 10.0% of the net profits and net losses
	of Carlyle Holdings (or 11.3% if the underwriters exercise in
	full their option to purchase additional common units). The
	remaining net profits and net losses will be allocated to the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings. These percentages are
	subject to change, including upon an exchange of Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	units and upon issuance of additional The Carlyle Group L.P.
	common units to the public. The Carlyle Group L.P. will hold,
	through wholly-owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units equal to the number of common units that The
	Carlyle Group L.P. has issued.


	 


	After this offering, we intend to cause Carlyle Holdings to make
	distributions to its partners, including The Carlyle Group
	L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries, in order to fund any
	distributions The Carlyle Group L.P. may declare on the common
	units. If Carlyle Holdings makes such distributions, the limited
	partners of Carlyle Holdings will be entitled to receive
	equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership
	interests in Carlyle Holdings. Because Carlyle Holdings I GP
	Inc. must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable
	agreement, the amounts ultimately distributed by The Carlyle
	Group L.P. to common unitholders are expected to be





	89








	 






	less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships to the limited partners of Carlyle
	Holdings in respect of their Carlyle Holdings partnership units.


	 


	The partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	will provide for cash distributions, which we refer to as
	tax distributions, to the partners of such
	partnerships if the

	wholly-owned

	subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P. which are the general
	partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships determine that the
	taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to
	taxable income for its partners. Generally, these tax
	distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net
	taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a
	partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest
	effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate
	resident in New York, New York (taking into account the
	non-deductibility of certain expenses and the character of our
	income). If we had effected the Reorganization on
	January 1, 2011, the assumed effective tax rate for 2011
	would have been approximately 46%. The Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent
	distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were
	otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities. The
	Carlyle Group L.P. is not required to distribute to its common
	unitholders any of the cash that its wholly-owned subsidiaries
	may receive as a result of tax distributions by the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships.

	USE OF
	PROCEEDS





	 


	We estimate that the net proceeds to The Carlyle Group L.P. from
	this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts,
	will be approximately $639.1 million, or
	$735.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their
	option to purchase additional common units.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. intends to use all of these proceeds to
	purchase newly issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units from
	Carlyle Holdings, as described under Organizational
	Structure  Offering Transactions. We intend to
	cause Carlyle Holdings to use substantially all of these
	proceeds to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under
	the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured
	credit facility. We intend to cause Carlyle Holdings to use any
	proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of their option
	to purchase additional common units from us to repay
	indebtedness under a loan agreement we entered into in
	connection with the acquisition of Claren Road and any remainder
	for general corporate purposes, including general operational
	needs, growth initiatives, acquisitions and strategic
	investments and to fund capital commitments to, and other
	investments in and alongside of, our investment funds. We
	anticipate that the acquisitions we may pursue will be those
	that would broaden our platform where we believe we can provide
	investors with differentiated products to meet their needs.
	Carlyle Holdings will also bear or reimburse The Carlyle Group
	L.P. for all of the expenses of this offering, which we estimate
	will be approximately $19.2 million.


	 


	Outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were
	$310.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and
	$618.1 million as of May 2, 2012. Our revolving
	credit facility matures on September 30, 2016 and currently
	bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) at
	an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed
	0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed
	1.75%. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility have been
	used to fund the redemption of the subordinated notes payable to
	Mubadala, portions of the consideration and/or related
	transaction expenses in connection with our recent acquisitions,
	and for other general corporate purposes. For additional
	information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis
	of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
	Recent Transactions and Notes 3, 9 and 15 to the
	combined and consolidated financial statements included
	elsewhere in this prospectus. Affiliates of some of the
	underwriters are lenders under the revolving credit facility and
	will receive proceeds to the extent their currently outstanding
	loans under that facility are repaid as described above. See
	Underwriting. The Claren Road loan matures on
	December 31, 2015 and bears interest at an adjustable
	annual rate, currently 6.0%.

	CASH
	DISTRIBUTION POLICY





	 


	Our general partner currently intends to cause The Carlyle Group
	L.P. to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders
	of its share of distributions from Carlyle Holdings, net of
	taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as
	described below. We currently anticipate that we will cause
	Carlyle Holdings to make quarterly distributions to its
	partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly owned
	subsidiaries, that will enable The Carlyle Group L.P. to pay a
	quarterly distribution of $0.16 per common unit, with
	the first such quarterly distribution being ratably reduced to
	reflect the portion of the quarter following the completion of
	this offering. In addition, we currently anticipate that we will
	cause Carlyle Holdings to make annual distributions to its
	partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly owned
	subsidiaries, in an amount that, taken together with the other
	above-described quarterly distributions, represents
	substantially all of our Distributable Earnings in excess of the
	amount determined by our general partner to be necessary or
	appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make
	appropriate investments in our business and our funds or to
	comply with applicable law or any of our financing agreements.
	We anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for
	most years will be less than our Distributable Earnings for that
	year due to these funding requirements.


	 


	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the declaration and payment of
	any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general
	partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time.
	Our general partner will take into account:


	 












	 


	 


	general economic and business conditions;




	 




	 


	 


	our strategic plans and prospects;




	 




	 


	 


	our business and investment opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	our financial condition and operating results, including our
	cash position, our net income and our realizations on
	investments made by our investment funds;




	 




	 


	 


	working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs;




	 




	 


	 


	contractual restrictions and obligations, including payment
	obligations pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and
	restrictions pursuant to our credit facility;




	 




	 


	 


	legal, tax and regulatory restrictions;




	 




	 


	 


	other constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our
	common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us; and




	 




	 


	 


	such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.




	 


	Because The Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and has
	no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units
	in Carlyle Holdings held through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we
	will fund distributions by The Carlyle Group L.P., if any, in
	three steps:


	 












	 


	 


	first, we will cause Carlyle Holdings to make distributions to
	its partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s
	wholly-owned subsidiaries. If Carlyle Holdings makes such
	distributions, the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings will be
	entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on
	their partnership interests in Carlyle Holdings;




	 




	 


	 


	second, we will cause The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned
	subsidiaries to distribute to The Carlyle Group L.P. their share
	of such distributions, net of taxes and amounts payable under
	the tax receivable agreement by such wholly-owned
	subsidiaries; and




	 




	 


	 


	third, The Carlyle Group L.P. will distribute its net share of
	such distributions to our common unitholders on a pro rata basis.




	 


	Because our wholly-owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make
	payments under the tax receivable agreement, the amounts
	ultimately distributed by us to our common unitholders are





	92








	 






	expected to be less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts
	distributed by the Carlyle Holdings partnerships to the limited
	partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships in respect of
	their Carlyle Holdings partnership units.


	 


	In addition, the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships will provide for cash distributions, which we refer
	to as tax distributions, to the partners of such
	partnerships if the wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. which are the general partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the
	relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its
	partners. Generally, these tax distributions will be computed
	based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant
	partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax
	rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined
	U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed
	for an individual or corporate resident in New York, New York
	(taking into account the non-deductibility of certain expenses
	and the character of our income). The Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent
	distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were
	otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities. The
	Carlyle Group L.P. is not required to distribute to its common
	unitholders any of the cash that its wholly-owned subsidiaries
	may receive as a result of tax distributions by the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships.


	 


	Under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a
	distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our
	liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of
	their partnership interests and liabilities for which the
	recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the
	partnership, would exceed the fair value of our assets. If we
	were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited
	partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the
	distribution that the distribution was in violation of the
	Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to us for the
	amount of the distribution for three years. In addition, the
	terms of our credit facility provide certain limits on our
	ability to make distributions. See Managements
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operation  Liquidity and Capital Resources.


	 


	In addition, Carlyle Holdings cash flow from operations
	may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax
	distributions to its partners, in which case Carlyle Holdings
	may have to borrow funds or sell assets, and thus our liquidity
	and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
	Furthermore, by paying cash distributions rather than investing
	that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of
	our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund
	our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital
	expenditures, should the need arise.


	 


	Our historical cash distributions include compensatory payments
	to our senior Carlyle professionals, which we have historically
	accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as
	employee compensation, and also include distributions in respect
	of co-investments made by the owners of the Parent Entities
	indirectly through the Parent Entities. Distributions related to
	co-investments are allocable solely to the individuals that
	funded those co-investments and would not be distributable to
	our common unitholders. Additionally, the 2010 Mubadala
	investment was a non-recurring transaction that resulted in a
	distribution to the existing owners of the Parent Entities in
	2010. Cash distributions, net of compensatory payments,

	DILUTION





	 


	If you invest in our common units, your interest will be diluted
	to the extent of the difference between the initial public
	offering price per common unit of our common units and the pro
	forma net tangible book value per common unit of our common
	units after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that
	the per common unit offering price of the common units is
	substantially in excess of the pro forma net tangible book value
	per common unit attributable to our existing owners.


	 


	Our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31,
	2011 was approximately $83.2 million, or $0.30 per common unit.
	Pro forma net tangible book value represents the amount of total
	tangible assets less total liabilities, after giving effect to
	the Reorganization, and pro forma net tangible book value per
	common unit represents pro forma net tangible book value divided
	by the number of common units outstanding, after giving effect
	to the Reorganization and treating as outstanding common units
	issuable upon exchange of outstanding partnership units in
	Carlyle Holdings (other than those held by The Carlyle Group
	L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries) on a

	one-for-one

	basis.


	 


	After giving effect to the transactions described under
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, including
	the repayment of indebtedness with a portion of the proceeds
	from this offering as described in Use of Proceeds,
	our adjusted pro forma net tangible book value as of
	December 31, 2011 would have been $665.2 million, or
	$2.18 per common unit. This represents an immediate increase in
	net tangible book value of $1.88 per common unit to our existing
	owners and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of
	$19.82 per common unit to investors in this offering.


	 


	The following table illustrates this dilution on a per common
	unit basis assuming the underwriters do not exercise their
	option to purchase additional common units:

	Because our existing owners do not own any of our common units,
	in order to present more meaningfully the dilutive impact on the
	investors in this offering we have calculated dilution in pro
	forma net tangible book value per common unit to investors in
	this offering by dividing pro forma net tangible book value by a
	number of common units that includes common units issuable upon
	exchange of outstanding partnership units in Carlyle Holdings
	(other than those held by The Carlyle Group L.P.s
	wholly-owned subsidiaries) on a

	one-for-one

	basis.


	 


	The following table summarizes, on the same pro forma basis as
	of December 31, 2011, the total number of common units
	purchased from us, the total cash consideration paid to us and
	the average price per common unit paid by our existing owners
	and by new investors purchasing common units in this offering,
	assuming that all of the holders of partnership units in Carlyle
	Holdings (other than





	96








	 






	The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries)
	exchanged their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for our
	common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis.

	SELECTED
	HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA





	 


	The following selected historical combined financial and other
	data of Carlyle Group, which comprises TC Group, L.L.C., TC
	Group Cayman L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC
	Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P., as well as their
	majority-owned subsidiaries, which are under common ownership
	and control by our individual senior Carlyle professionals,
	CalPERS and entities affiliated with Mubadala, should be read
	together with Organizational Structure,
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information,
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations and the historical
	financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
	this prospectus. Carlyle Group is considered our predecessor for
	accounting purposes, and its combined financial statements will
	be our historical financial statements following this offering.


	 


	We derived the selected historical combined and consolidated
	statements of operations data of Carlyle Group for each of the
	years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the
	selected historical combined and consolidated balance sheet data
	as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 from our audited combined
	and consolidated financial statements which are included
	elsewhere in this prospectus. We derived the selected historical
	condensed combined and consolidated statements of operations
	data of Carlyle Group for the years ended December 31, 2008
	and 2007 and the selected condensed combined and consolidated
	balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
	from our audited combined and consolidated financial statements
	which are not included in this prospectus. The combined and
	consolidated financial statements of Carlyle Group have been
	prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical
	periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the
	same entities in all periods shown due to changes in
	U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and
	termination of funds.


	 


	Net income (loss) is determined in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP for partnerships and is not comparable to net
	income of a corporation. All distributions and compensation for
	services rendered by Carlyles individual partners have
	been reflected as distributions from equity rather than
	compensation expense in the historical combined and consolidated
	financial statements.


	 


	The selected historical combined and consolidated financial data
	is not indicative of the expected future operating results of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. following the Reorganization and the
	Offering Transactions. Prior to this offering, we completed a
	series of transactions pursuant to which our business was
	reorganized into a holding partnership structure as described in
	Organizational Structure whereby, among other
	things, the Parent Entities have distributed to our existing
	owners certain investments and equity interests that will not be
	contributed to Carlyle Holdings. See Organizational
	Structure and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information.


	 


	The selected unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of
	operations data for the year ended December 31, 2011
	presents our consolidated results of operations giving pro forma
	effect to the Reorganization and Offering Transactions described
	under Organizational Structure, and the other
	transactions described in Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information, as if such transactions had occurred on
	January 1, 2011. The selected unaudited pro forma
	consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011
	presents our consolidated financial position giving pro forma
	effect to the Reorganization and Offering Transactions described
	under Organizational Structure, and the other
	transactions described in Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information, as if such transactions had occurred on
	December 31, 2011. The pro forma adjustments are based on
	available information and upon assumptions that our management
	believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma
	basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical
	combined and consolidated financial information of Carlyle
	Group. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial
	information is included for informational purposes only and does
	not purport to reflect the results of operations or financial
	position of Carlyle Group that would have occurred had the
	transactions described above occurred on the dates indicated or
	had we operated as a public company during the periods presented
	or for any future period or date. The unaudited condensed
	consolidated pro





	98








	 






	forma financial information should not be relied upon as being
	indicative of our results of operations or financial position
	had the transactions described under Organizational
	Structure and the use of the estimated net proceeds from
	this offering as described under Use of Proceeds
	occurred on the dates assumed. The unaudited pro forma
	consolidated financial information also does not project our
	results of operations or financial position for any future

	The entities comprising our
	Consolidated Funds are not the same entities for all periods
	presented. In February 2007, we formed a hedge fund which we
	consolidated into our financial statements and included in our
	Consolidated Funds prospectively from that date. In December
	2007, we amended most of the co-investment entities so that the
	presumption of control by the general partner had been overcome,
	and therefore we ceased to consolidate those entities
	prospectively from that date. In 2008, the hedge fund that we
	had formed in February 2007 began an orderly liquidation and
	ceased operations. Pursuant to revised consolidation guidance
	that became effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated the
	existing and any subsequently acquired CLOs where we hold a
	controlling financial interest. The consolidation or
	deconsolidation of funds generally has the effect of grossing up
	or down, respectively, reported assets, liabilities, and cash
	flows, and has no effect on net income attributable to Carlyle
	Group or members equity.

	MANAGEMENTS
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 



	The following discussion and analysis should be read in
	conjunction with the historical financial statements and related
	notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and with the
	discussions under Organizational Structure and
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. This
	discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject
	to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those
	described under the section entitled Risk Factors,
	contained elsewhere in this prospectus describing key risks
	associated with our business, operations and industry. Actual
	results may differ materially from those contained in our
	forward-looking statements. Percentages presented in the tables
	throughout our discussion and analysis of financial condition
	and results of operations may reflect rounding adjustments and
	consequently totals may not appear to sum.



	 



	The historical combined and consolidated financial data
	discussed below reflect the historical results of operations and
	financial position of Carlyle Group, which comprises TC Group,
	L.L.C., TC Group Cayman L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P.
	and TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P. (collectively, the
	Parent Entities), as well as their controlled
	subsidiaries, which are under common ownership and control by
	our individual senior Carlyle professionals, entities affiliated
	with Mubadala Development Company, the

	Abu-Dhabi

	based strategic development and investment company
	(Mubadala) and California Public Employees
	Retirement System (CalPERS). Senior Carlyle

	Overview





	 


	We conduct our operations through four reportable segments:
	Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Market Strategies
	and Fund of Funds Solutions. We launched operations in our Fund
	of Funds Solutions segment with the acquisition of a 60% equity
	interest in AlpInvest on July 1, 2011.


	 












	 


	 



	Corporate Private Equity

	 Our Corporate
	Private Equity segment advises our buyout and growth capital
	funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different
	sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2011, our
	Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately
	$51 billion in AUM and approximately $38 billion in
	fee-earning AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Real Assets

	 Our Real Assets segment advises
	our U.S. and internationally focused real estate and
	infrastructure funds, as well as our energy and renewable
	resources funds. As of December 31, 2011, our Real Assets
	segment had approximately $31 billion in AUM and
	approximately $22 billion in fee-earning AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Global Market Strategies

	 Our Global Market
	Strategies segment advises a group of funds that pursue
	investment opportunities across various types of credit,
	equities and alternative instruments, and (as regards to certain
	macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities and interest
	rate products and their derivatives. As of December 31,
	2011, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately
	$24 billion in AUM and approximately $23 billion in
	fee-earning AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Fund of Funds Solutions

	 Our Fund of Funds
	Solutions segment was launched upon our acquisition of a 60%
	equity interest in AlpInvest on July 1, 2011 and advises a
	global private equity fund of funds program and related
	co-investment and secondary activities. As of December 31,
	2011, AlpInvest had approximately $41 billion in AUM and
	approximately $28 billion in fee-earning AUM.




	 


	We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements
	with the investment funds that we manage and fees for
	transaction advisory and oversight services provided to
	portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a
	performance fee from an investment fund, which may be





	101








	 






	either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of
	income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event
	that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund.
	Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we are
	required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we
	advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present
	revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these
	investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily
	consist of fund management and related advisory fees,
	performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried
	interest allocations), investment income, including realized and
	unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other
	trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our
	segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits
	expenses, including salaries, bonuses and performance payment
	arrangements, and general and administrative expenses.



	 




	Trends
	Affecting our Business





	 


	Our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors
	including global economic and market conditions, particularly in
	the United States, Europe and Asia. We believe that our
	investment philosophy and broad diversity of investments across
	industries, asset classes and geographies enhances the stability
	of our distributable earnings and management fee streams,
	reduces the volatility of our carried interest and performance
	fees and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated
	with any specific fund, investment or vintage. In general, a
	climate of low and stable interest rates and high levels of
	liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a
	positive environment for us to generate attractive investment
	returns. We also believe that periods of volatility and
	dislocation in the capital markets present us with opportunities
	to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future
	revenue growth and to utilize investment strategies, such as our
	distressed debt strategies, which tend to benefit from such
	market conditions.


	 


	In addition to these global macro-economic and market factors,
	our future performance is also heavily dependent on our ability
	to attract new capital and investors, generate strong returns
	from our existing investments, deploy our funds capital in
	appropriate and successful investments and meet evolving
	investor needs.


	 












	 


	 



	The attractiveness of the alternative asset management
	industry

	.  Our ability to attract new capital and
	investors is driven in part by the extent to which investors
	continue to see the alternative asset management industry as an
	attractive vehicle for capital preservation and growth. While
	our recent fundraising has resulted in new capital commitments
	at levels that remain below the historically high volume
	achieved during 2007 and early 2008, we believe our fundraising
	efforts will benefit from certain fundamental trends that
	include: (i) institutional investors pursuit of
	higher relative investment returns which have historically been
	provided by top quartile alternative asset management funds;
	(ii) distributions to existing investors from historical
	commitments which could be used to fund new allocations;
	(iii) the entrance of new institutional investors from
	developing markets, including sovereign wealth funds and other
	entities; and (iv) increasing interest from high net worth
	individuals.




	 




	 


	 



	Our ability to generate strong returns.

	  The
	strength of our investment performance affects investors
	willingness to commit capital to our funds. The capital we are
	able to attract drives the growth of our AUM and the management
	fees we earn. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and
	December 31, 2011, we have distributed approximately
	$27 billion from our carry funds to our investors. Although
	we have recently exited several investments at attractive
	returns and the fair value of our funds net assets has
	increased significantly with the economic recovery, there can be
	no assurance that these trends will continue. In addition,
	valuations in many of our funds experienced volatility during
	2011, a trend which could occur again in the near- to
	medium-term.




	 












	 


	  


	During 2008 and 2009, many economies around the world, including
	the U.S. economy, experienced significant declines in
	employment, household wealth and lending. Those events led to a
	significantly diminished availability of credit and an increase
	in the cost of financing.







	102








	 
















	 




	The lack of credit in 2008 and 2009 materially hindered the
	initiation of new, large-sized transactions for our Corporate
	Private Equity and Real Assets segments and adversely impacted
	our operating results in those periods. While we continued to
	experience some capital markets volatility in 2011, in contrast
	to 2008 and 2009 credit remains available selectively for high
	quality corporate transactions, though financing costs remain
	elevated from pre-recession levels. Finally, a significant
	portion of our revenues are derived from performance fees, the
	size of which is dependent on the success of our fund
	investments. A decrease in valuations of our fund investments
	will result in a reduction of accrued performance fees which we
	would expect to be most significant in Corporate Private Equity,
	our largest business segment.




	 












	 


	 



	Our successful deployment of capital.

	  Our
	ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon
	our ability to successfully deploy the capital that our
	investors have committed to our funds. During the years ended
	December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, we have
	invested more than $21 billion in new and existing
	investments representing an investment pace that is comparable
	to our investment pace during the peak of private equity capital
	deployment during 2006 through 2008. As of December 31,
	2011, we had approximately $37 billion in capital available
	for investment. We believe that this puts us in a position to
	grow our revenues over time. Our ability to identify and execute
	investments which our investment professionals determine to be
	attractive continues to depend on a number of factors, including
	competition, valuation, credit availability and pricing and
	other general market conditions.




	 




	 


	 



	Our ability to meet evolving investor
	requirements.

	  We believe that investors will seek
	to deploy their investment capital in a variety of different
	ways, including fund investments, separate accounts and direct
	co-investments. We anticipate that this trend will result in a
	bifurcation within the global alternative asset management
	industry, with a limited number of large global market
	participants joined by numerous smaller and more specialized
	funds, providing investors with greater flexibility when
	allocating their investment capital. In addition, we expect that
	certain larger investors will seek to allocate more resources to
	managed accounts through which they can directly hold title to
	assets and better control their investments.




	 


	Our results of operations also reflect, among other things, the
	impact of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007 and
	ultimately resulted in a deep global recession. The general
	tightening in credit availability adversely impacted the global
	investment industry, including our investment funds and their
	portfolio companies. This global downturn resulted in a relative
	scarcity of new, attractive investment opportunities and limited
	our ability to exit investments in our funds, which in turn
	reduced the carried interest we generated. We believe that our
	funds and their portfolio companies benefitted, however, from
	our efforts to work with management teams to access available
	liquidity, strategically reposition capital structures and focus
	on eliminating costs within core business operations. Beginning
	in the second half of 2009, the capital markets began to
	stabilize and recover from the economic recession and credit
	crisis, although they experienced significant volatility
	following the downgrade by Standard & Poors on
	August 5, 2011 of the long-term credit rating of
	U.S. Treasury debt from AAA to AA+. While access to capital
	markets and asset valuations have improved markedly since 2009,
	it is not known how extensive this recovery will be or whether
	it will continue. In addition, the recent speculation regarding
	the inability of Greece and certain other European countries to
	pay their national debt, the response by Eurozone policy makers
	to mitigate this sovereign debt crisis and the concerns
	regarding the stability of the Eurozone currency have created
	uncertainty in the credit markets. As a result, there has been a
	strain on banks and other financial services participants, which
	could have an adverse impact on our business.


	 


	We were able to make significant distributions to the investors
	in our carry funds in 2010 and 2011 as a result of successful
	realization activity in these funds. This successful realization
	activity favorably impacted our realized performance fees, but
	negatively impacted our fee-earning AUM to the extent such
	realizations occured in funds whose management fees are
	calculated on the basis of





	103








	 






	invested capital. To the extent such successful realization
	activity continues in subsequent periods, we would expect a
	similar impact.


	 


	In addition, the investment periods for many of the large carry
	funds that we raised during the particularly productive period
	from 2007 to early 2008 are, unless extended, scheduled to
	expire beginning in 2012, which will result in step-downs in the
	applicable management fee rates for certain of these funds. Our
	management fee revenues will be reduced by these step-downs in
	management fee rates, as well as by any adverse impact on
	fee-earning AUM resulting from successful realization activity
	in our carry funds, offset by the favorable impact on
	fee-earning AUM and management fee revenues of our recent
	acquisitions and anticipated new fundraising initiatives.


	 


	As we pursue new fundraising initiatives and prepare for the
	demands of being a public company, we anticipate that
	compensation and benefits and general and administrative
	expenses will increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 as we
	continue to add staff across the firm and build out our
	back-office infrastructure and systems.


	 





	Preliminary
	Fund Valuation Information for the Three Months Ended
	March 31, 2012





	 


	The fund valuation information discussed below are preliminary
	estimates and are subject to quarterly review procedures and
	final reconciliations and adjustments. Actual fund valuations
	may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be
	material.


	 


	We estimate that the investments of our carry funds appreciated
	approximately 9% during the three months ended March 31,
	2012. We estimate that the investments of our Corporate Private
	Equity funds appreciated approximately 8% during this period,
	with the investments of our buyout funds appreciating
	approximately 9% and the investments of our growth capital funds
	appreciating approximately 5%. We estimate that the investments
	of our Real Assets funds appreciated approximately 11% during
	this period, with the investments of our real estate and
	infrastructure funds appreciating approximately 6%, and the
	investments of our energy funds appreciating approximately 14%.
	We estimate that the investments of the carry funds advised by
	our Global Market Strategies segment appreciated approximately
	12% during this period. Preliminary valuation information for
	the fund of funds vehicles advised by our Fund of Funds
	Solutions segment is not yet available.


	 


	While the appreciation/(depreciation) of the investments of our
	carry funds is one of the many drivers of performance fees,
	there are other factors that impact this type of revenue and
	this information should not be construed as an indication of
	performance fees, or of any other component of our revenues or
	expenses, for any period. An investment in The Carlyle Group
	L.P. is not an investment in any of our funds. See Risk
	Factors  Risks Related to Our Business
	Operations  The historical returns attributable to
	our funds, including those presented in this prospectus, should
	not be considered as indicative of the future results of our
	funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an
	investment in our common units.

	Reorganization





	 


	In connection with this offering we effected a Reorganization
	described in greater detail under Organizational
	Structure. The Reorganization had the following primary
	elements:


	 



	Restructuring of Certain Third Party
	Interests.

	  Certain existing and former owners of
	the Parent Entities (including CalPERS and former and current
	senior Carlyle professionals) have beneficial interests in
	investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such
	persons indirectly through the Parent Entities. In order to
	minimize the extent of third party ownership interests in firm
	assets, prior to the completion of the offering we have
	(i) distributed a portion of these interests (approximately
	$118.5 million as of December 31, 2011) to the
	beneficial owners so that they are held directly by such persons
	and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and
	(ii) restructured the remainder of these interests
	(approximately $84.8 million as of December 31,
	2011) so that they are reflected as

	non-controlling

	interests in our financial statements. In addition, prior to the
	offering the Parent Entities have restructured ownership of
	certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior
	Carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will
	be reflected as non-controlling interests in our financial
	statements. Such restructured carried interest rights





	105








	 






	accounted for approximately $42.3 million of our
	performance fee revenue for the year ended December 31,
	2011. See Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.


	 



	Distribution of Earnings.

	  During 2012, in
	the ordinary course of business, we have made distributions to
	our existing owners, including distributions sourced from
	realized carried interest and incentive fees. Prior to the date
	of the offering the Parent Entities have also made to their
	owners a cash distribution of previously undistributed earnings
	totaling $28.0 million.


	 



	Contribution of the Parent Entities and Other Interests to
	Carlyle Holdings.

	  Prior to the consummation of
	this offering:


	 












	 


	 


	our senior Carlyle professionals, Mubadala and CalPERS
	contributed all of their interests in:




	 












	 


	 


	TC Group, L.L.C. to Carlyle Holdings I L.P.;




	 




	 


	 


	TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman
	Investment Holdings, L.P. to Carlyle Holdings II
	L.P.; and




	 




	 


	 


	TC Group Cayman, L.P. to Carlyle Holdings III L.P.; and




	 












	 


	 


	senior Carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged in
	our business contributed to the Carlyle Holdings partnerships a
	portion of the equity interests they owned in the general
	partners of our existing carry funds.




	 


	In consideration of these contributions our existing owners
	received an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units.


	 


	Accordingly, following the Reorganization and this offering, The
	Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and, through wholly
	owned subsidiaries, holds equity interests in three Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships (which we refer to collectively as
	Carlyle Holdings), which in turn own the four Parent
	Entities. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Carlyle
	Group L.P. will be the sole general partner of each of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Accordingly, The Carlyle Group
	L.P. will operate and control all of the business and affairs of
	Carlyle Holdings and will consolidate the financial results of
	the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and its consolidated
	subsidiaries, and the ownership interest of the limited partners
	of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will be reflected as a
	non-controlling interest in The Carlyle Group L.P.s
	consolidated financial statements.



	 




	Consolidation
	of Certain Carlyle Funds





	 


	Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we consolidate certain Carlyle
	funds, related co-investment entities and CLOs that we advise,
	which we refer to collectively as the Consolidated Funds, in our
	combined and consolidated financial statements for certain of
	the periods we present. These funds represented approximately
	16% of our AUM as of December 31, 2011, 10% of our fund
	management fees and 3% of our performance fees for the year
	ended December 31, 2011.


	 


	We are not required under U.S. GAAP to consolidate most of
	the investment funds we advise in our combined and consolidated
	financial statements because such funds provide the limited
	partners with the right to dissolve the fund without cause by a
	simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle affiliated limited
	partners, which overcomes the presumption of control by Carlyle.
	Beginning in 2010, we consolidated certain CLOs that we advise
	as a result of revisions to the accounting standards governing
	consolidations. Beginning in July 2011, we consolidated certain
	AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2011,
	our consolidated CLOs held approximately $11 billion of
	total assets and comprised 54% of the assets of the Consolidated
	Funds and 100% of the loans payable of the Consolidated Funds.
	As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated AlpInvest fund of
	funds vehicles had approximately $7 billion of total assets
	and comprised 35% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds. The
	remainder of the assets of the Consolidated Funds as of
	December 31, 2011 relates to our consolidated hedge funds
	and other consolidated funds. The assets and liabilities of the
	Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal
	entities and, as a result, the





	106








	 






	liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.
	For further information on consolidation of certain funds, see
	Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 


	Generally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a

	gross-up

	effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net
	effect on the net income attributable to Carlyle Group and
	members equity. The majority of the net economic ownership
	interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, redeemable
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and equity
	appropriated for Consolidated Funds in the combined and
	consolidated financial statements. For further information, see
	Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 


	Because only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the
	performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily
	consistent with or representative of the combined performance
	trends of all of our funds.



	 




	Key
	Financial Measures





	 


	Our key financial measures are discussed in the following pages.


	 





	Revenues





	 


	Revenues primarily consist of fund management fees, performance
	fees, investment income, including realized and unrealized gains
	of our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as
	well as interest and other income. See
	 Critical Accounting Policies 
	Performance Fees and Note 2 to the combined and
	consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
	prospectus for additional information regarding the manner in
	which management fees and performance fees are generated.


	 



	Fund Management Fees.

	  Fund management
	fees include (i) management fees earned on capital
	commitments or AUM and (ii) transaction and portfolio
	advisory fees. Management fees are fees we receive for advisory
	services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner
	interest or with which we have an investment advisory or
	investment management agreement. Management fees are based on
	(a) third parties capital commitments to our
	investment funds, (b) third parties remaining capital
	invested in our investment funds or (c) the net asset value
	(NAV) of certain of our investment funds, as
	described in our combined and consolidated financial statements.

	Fee-earning

	AUM based on NAV was approximately 7% of our total fee-earning
	AUM during the year ended December 31, 2011 and less than
	6% of our total fee-earning AUM during the year ended
	December 31, 2010.


	 


	Management fees for funds in our Corporate Private Equity and
	Real Assets segments generally range from 1.0% to 2.0% of
	commitments during the investment period of the relevant fund.
	Large funds tend to have lower effective management fee rates,
	while smaller funds tend to have effective management fee rates
	approaching 2.0%. Following the expiration or termination of the
	investment period of such funds the management fees generally
	step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% of contributions for
	unrealized investments. Depending upon the contracted terms of
	investment advisory or investment management and related
	agreements, these fees are called semiannually in advance and
	are recognized as earned over the subsequent six month period.
	As a result, cash on hand and deferred revenue will generally be
	higher at or around January 1 and July 1, which are
	the semiannual due dates for management fees. Management fees
	from the fund of funds vehicles in our Fund of Funds Solutions
	segment generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the fund or
	vehicles capital commitments during the first two to
	five years of the investment period and 0.3% to 1.0% on the
	lower of cost of the capital invested or fair value of the
	capital invested thereafter. Management fees for our Fund of
	Fund Solutions segment are due quarterly and recognized over the
	related quarter. Our hedge funds generally pay management fees
	quarterly that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of NAV per year.
	Management fees for our CLOs typically range from 0.4% to 0.5%
	on the total par amount of assets in the fund and are due
	quarterly or semiannually based on the terms and recognized over
	the





	107








	 






	relevant period. Our management fees for our CLOs and credit
	opportunities funds are governed by indentures and collateral
	management agreements. With respect to Claren Road, ESG and
	AlpInvest, we retain a specified percentage of the earnings of
	the businesses based on our ownership in the management
	companies of 55% in the case of Claren Road and ESG and 60% in
	the case of AlpInvest. Management fees are not subject to
	repayment but may be offset to the extent that other fees are
	earned as described below under  Transaction
	and Portfolio Advisory Fee.


	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2011, management fees
	attributable to our latest U.S. buyout fund (CP V) with
	approximately $13 billion of fee-earning AUM as of such
	date and our latest Europe buyout fund (CEP III) with
	approximately $7 billion of fee-earning AUM as of such date
	were approximately 20% and 10%, respectively, of total
	management fees recognized during the year. For the years ended
	December 31, 2010 and 2009, management fees attributable to
	CP V and CEP III were approximately 21% and 13%, respectively,
	of total management fees recognized in each year. No other fund
	generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods
	presented.


	 



	Transaction and Portfolio Advisory
	Fees.

	  Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are
	fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory
	services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by
	separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and
	portfolio advisory fees for these services when the service has
	been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are
	required to offset our fund management fees earned by a
	percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we
	refer to as the rebate offsets. Such rebate offset
	percentages generally range from 50% to 80% of the transaction
	and advisory fees earned. While the portfolio advisory fees are
	relatively consistent, transaction fees vary in accordance with
	our investment pace.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees consist
	principally of the special residual allocation of profits to
	which we are entitled, commonly referred to as carried interest,
	from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the
	carry funds. We are generally entitled to a 20%
	allocation (or 1.8% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of
	funds vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried
	interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of
	preferred returns of generally 8% to 9% and the return of
	certain fund costs (subject to

	catch-up

	provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership
	agreement). Carried interest revenue, which is a component of
	performance fees in our combined and consolidated financial
	statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the
	valuation of our funds investments above certain return
	hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement
	and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to
	the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the
	funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of
	carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our
	share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated
	funds underlying investments measured at their
	then-current fair values. As a result, the performance fees
	earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of
	any future period. Carried interest is ultimately realized and
	distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is
	profitably disposed of, (ii) the investment funds
	cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and
	(iii) we have decided to collect carry rather than return
	additional capital to limited partner investors. The portion of
	performance fees that are realized and unrealized in each period
	are separately reported in our statements of operations. As
	noted above, prior to the consummation of this offering, we will
	restructure certain carried interest rights allocated to certain
	retired senior Carlyle professionals of the Parent Entities so
	that such carried interest rights are reflected as
	non-controlling interests in our financial statements. In
	addition, in connection with the Reorganization, the portion of
	carried interest allocated to our senior Carlyle professionals
	and other personnel who work in our fund operations will
	decrease from historical levels to approximately 45%. See
	Organizational Structure  Reorganization.
	Among other adjustments, the presentation of Economic Net Income
	in our pro forma financial statements includes adjustments to
	our historical Economic Net Income related to (i) income
	attributable to the carried interest rights which will be
	reflected as non-controlling interests, and (ii) the change
	in the portion of carried interest allocated to our senior
	Carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in our fund
	operations. See Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information.


	 


	Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management
	team of AlpInvest, such persons are allocated all carried
	interest in respect of the historical investments and
	commitments to





	108








	 






	the fund of funds vehicles that existed as of December 31,
	2010, 85% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from
	the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011
	and 2020 and 60% of the carried interest in respect of all other
	commitments (including all future commitments from third
	parties).


	 


	Our performance fees are generated by a diverse set of funds
	with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment
	strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the
	fund acronyms used throughout this Managements Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
	section, please see Business  Our Family
	of Funds.


	 


	Performance fees from two of our U.S. buyout funds (CP V
	and CP IV), (with total AUM of approximately $14.9 billion
	and $9.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
	2011) were $491.9 million and $472.3 million,
	respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
	Performance fees from CP IV were $668.7 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2010. The investment by our first
	Asia buyout fund (CAP I) and related co-investment vehicles
	in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. Ltd. (China
	Pacific) (with combined total AUM of approximately
	$5.4 billion as of December 31, 2009), generated
	performance fees of $525.5 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2009.


	 


	Realized carried interest may be clawed-back or given back to
	the fund if the funds investment values decline below
	certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. If the
	fair value of a funds investments falls below the
	applicable return hurdles previously recognized carried interest
	and performance fees are reduced. In all cases, each investment
	fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and
	potential giveback obligations. For any given period carried
	interest income could thus be negative; however, cumulative
	performance fees and allocations can never be negative over the
	life of a fund. In addition, Carlyle is not obligated to pay
	guaranteed returns or hurdles. If upon a hypothetical
	liquidation of a funds investments at the then-current
	fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried
	interest would be required to be returned, a liability is
	established in Carlyles financial statements for the
	potential giveback obligation. As discussed below, each
	individual recipient of realized carried interest typically
	signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that
	personally obligates such person to return

	his/her

	pro
	rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest
	previously distributed that are later clawed back. Generally,
	the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until
	the end of a funds life.


	 


	In addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are
	also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from
	certain of our Global Market Strategies funds when the return on
	AUM exceeds previous calendar-year ending or

	date-of-investment

	high-water marks. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive
	fees or allocations equal to 20% of the funds profits for
	the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is
	the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund
	investors account on which incentive fees were paid and
	means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such
	fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investors
	account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior
	year-end NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investors
	investment, generally excluding any contributions and
	redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. We recognize the
	incentive fees from our hedge funds as they are earned. In these
	arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance
	benchmark has been achieved and are included in performance fees
	in our combined and consolidated statements of operations. These
	incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our
	combined and consolidated financial statements and are treated
	as accrued until paid to us.


	 


	For any given period, performance fee revenue on our statement
	of operations may include reversals of previously recognized
	performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular
	fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees
	earned to date. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010
	and 2009, the reversals of performance fees were
	$(286.8) million, $(38.5) million, and
	$(133.8) million, respectively.


	 


	As of December 31, 2011, accrued performance fees and
	accrued giveback obligations were approximately
	$2.2 billion and $136.5 million, respectively. Each
	balance assumes a hypothetical





	109








	 






	liquidation of the funds investments at December 31,
	2011 at their then current fair values. These assets and
	liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the
	fair values of the fund investments until they are realized.


	 


	In addition, realized performance fees may be reversed in future
	periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a
	giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2011, all
	investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, the
	amount of realized and previously distributed performance fees
	subject to potential giveback would be $856.7 million. See
	the related discussion of Contingent Obligations
	(Giveback) within  Liquidity and Capital
	Resources.


	 


	As described above, each investment fund is considered
	separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback
	obligations. As a result, performance fees within funds will
	continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments
	within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in
	that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our
	funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.


	 


	In addition, we use the term net performance fees to
	refer to the carried interest from our carry funds and Global
	Market Strategies funds net of the portion allocated to our
	investment professionals which is reflected as performance fee
	related compensation expense.


	 


	See  Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the
	amount of realized and unrealized performance fees recognized
	and or reversed each period. See  Segment
	Analysis for the realized and unrealized performance fees
	by segment and related discussion for each period.


	 



	Investment Income and Interest and Other
	Income.

	  Investment income and interest and other
	income represent the unrealized and realized gains and losses on
	our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle
	funds that are not consolidated, our equity method investments
	and other principal investments, as well as any interest and
	other income. Unrealized investment income (loss) results from
	changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well
	as the reversal of unrealized gains (losses) at the time an
	investment is realized. As noted above, prior to the
	consummation of this offering, we will distribute to their
	beneficial owners certain investments in or alongside our funds
	beneficially owned by certain existing and former owners of the
	Parent Entities, and restructure the remainder of such
	beneficial interests so that they are reflected as
	non-controlling interests in our financial statements. Among
	other adjustments, the presentation of Economic Net Income in
	our pro forma financial statements includes adjustments to our
	historical Economic Net Income related to the investment income
	that is attributable to any such investments which either will
	no longer be consolidated or will be reflected as
	non-controlling interests, as the case may be. See
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.


	 



	Interest and Other Income of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Interest and other income of Consolidated
	Funds principally represent presently the interest earned on CLO
	assets. However, the Consolidated Funds are not the same
	entities in all periods presented and may change in future
	periods due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms
	and terminations of funds.


	 



	Net Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Net investment gains (losses) of
	Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair
	value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated
	Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets
	of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or
	depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities
	of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily
	indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated
	Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees
	received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated
	Funds. Substantially all of the net investment gains (losses) of
	Consolidated Funds are attributable to the limited partner
	investors and allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore
	a gain or loss is not expected to have an impact on the revenues
	or profitability of Carlyle. Moreover, although the assets of
	the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet
	pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse
	to





	110








	 






	such assets and such liabilities are non-recourse to us.
	Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds does not
	impact the assets available to our equity holders.


	 





	Expenses





	 



	Compensation and Benefits.

	  Compensation
	includes salaries, bonuses and performance payment arrangements
	for non-partners. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to
	which they relate. Compensation attributable to our senior
	Carlyle professionals has historically been accounted for as
	distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation.
	Accordingly, net income as determined in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP for partnerships is not comparable to net income
	of a corporation. Furthermore, any unpaid obligation to our
	senior Carlyle professionals has historically been presented as
	a separate liability to our senior Carlyle professionals. We
	recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance
	fees that are due to our employees and operating executives in a
	manner consistent with how we recognize the performance fee
	revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense
	in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and,
	until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued
	compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of
	performance fees is not paid until the related performance fees
	are realized, and not when such performance fees are accrued.
	The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance fees
	to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and operating
	executives. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of
	performance fee compensation to performance fee revenue may vary
	based on the funds generating the performance fee revenue for
	that period and their particular allocation percentages.


	 


	Upon the effectiveness of this offering, we will account for
	compensation to senior Carlyle professionals as an expense in
	our statement of operations and have reflected the related
	adjustments in our pro forma financial statements. See
	Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. In our
	calculations of Economic Net Income, Fee Related Earnings and
	Distributable Earnings, which are used by management in
	assessing the performance of our segments, we include an
	adjustment to reflect a pro forma charge for partner
	compensation. See  Combined and Consolidated
	Results of Operations  Non-GAAP Financial
	Measures for a reconciliation of Income Before Provision
	for Income Taxes to Total Segments Economic Net Income, of Total
	Segments Economic Net Income to Fee Related Earnings and of Fee
	Related Earnings to Distributable Earnings.


	 


	Also upon the effectiveness of this offering, we will implement
	various equity-based compensation arrangements that will require
	senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest
	ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a future
	service period of up to six years, which under U.S. GAAP will
	result in compensation charges over future periods. Compensation
	charges associated with the equity-based compensation grants
	issued upon completion of this offering or issued in future
	acquisitions will not be reflected in our calculations of
	Economic Net Income, Fee Related Earnings and Distributable
	Earnings.


	 


	We expect that we will hire additional individuals and that
	overall compensation levels will correspondingly increase, which
	will result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense.
	As a result of recent acquisitions, we will have charges
	associated with contingent consideration taking the form of
	earn-outs and profit participation, some of which will be
	reflected as compensation expense in future periods. We also
	expect that our fundraising will increase in future periods and
	as a result we expect that our compensation expense will also
	increase in periods where we close on increased levels of new
	capital commitments. Amounts due to employees related to such
	fundraising will be expensed when earned even though the benefit
	of the new capital and related fees will be reflected in
	operations over the life of the related fund.


	 



	General, Administrative and Other
	Expenses.

	  Other operating expenses represent
	general and administrative expenses including occupancy and
	equipment expenses, interest and other expenses, which consist
	principally of professional fees, travel and related expenses,
	communications and information services, depreciation and
	amortization and foreign currency transactions.




	111








	 






	We anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses
	will fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the
	impact of foreign exchange transactions. Additionally, we expect
	that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to
	infrequently occurring or unusual items. We also expect to incur
	greater expenses in the future related to our recent
	acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles,
	earn-outs to equity holders and fair value adjustments on
	contingent consideration issued.


	 



	Interest and Other Expenses of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  The interest and other expenses of
	Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expense related
	primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other
	third-party expenses.


	 



	Income Taxes.

	  Prior to the Reorganization in
	connection with this offering, we have operated as a group of
	pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and our
	profits and losses are allocated to the individual senior
	Carlyle professionals, which are individually responsible for
	reporting such amounts. We record a provision for state and
	local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable
	laws. Based on applicable foreign tax laws, we record a
	provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities.


	 


	Income taxes for foreign entities are accounted for using the
	liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
	tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of
	assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using
	currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and
	liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
	the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
	reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not
	that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


	 


	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination
	by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators.
	As of December 31, 2011, our U.S. federal income tax
	returns for the years 2008 through 2011 are open under the
	normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject
	to examination. State and local tax returns are generally
	subject to audit from 2007 to 2011. Specifically, our
	Washington, D.C. franchise tax years are currently open, as
	are our New York City returns, for the tax years 2008 to 2011.
	Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2005 to
	2011. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are currently under
	audit by foreign tax authorities.


	 


	Following this offering the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and
	their subsidiaries will continue to operate as pass-through
	entities for U.S. income tax purposes and record a
	provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities.
	In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is subject to additional
	entity-level taxes that will be reflected in our consolidated
	financial statements. For information on the pro forma effective
	tax rate of The Carlyle Group L.P. following the Reorganization,
	see Note 2(b) in Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
	Information.


	 



	Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated
	Entities.

	  Non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities represent the component of equity in
	consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are
	adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions
	and redemptions in hedge funds which occur during the reporting
	period. Non-controlling interests related to hedge funds are
	subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these
	funds following the expiration of a specified period of time
	(typically one year), or may be withdrawn subject to a
	redemption fee in the hedge funds during the period when capital
	may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in these types of
	funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to
	third-party interests in such consolidated funds are presented
	as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities
	within the combined and consolidated balance sheets. When
	redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are
	classified as a liability and included in other liabilities of
	Consolidated Funds in the combined and consolidated balance
	sheets. Following this offering, we will also record significant
	non-controlling interests in income of consolidated entities
	relating to the ownership interest of our existing owners in
	Carlyle Holdings. As described in Organizational
	Structure, The Carlyle Group L.P. will, through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, be the sole general partner of each
	of





	112








	 






	the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. will
	consolidate the financial results of Carlyle Holdings and its
	consolidated subsidiaries, and the ownership interest of the
	limited partners of Carlyle Holdings will be reflected as a
	non-controlling interest in The Carlyle Group L.P.s
	consolidated financial statements.


	 





	Non-GAAP Financial
	Measures





	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  Economic net income or
	ENI, is a key performance benchmark used in our
	industry. ENI represents segment net income which excludes the
	impact of income taxes, acquisition-related items including
	amortization of acquired intangibles and contingent
	consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated
	with equity-based compensation issued in this offering or future
	acquisitions, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or
	unusual events. We believe the exclusion of these items provides
	investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating
	performance. For segment reporting purposes, revenues and
	expenses, and accordingly segment net income, are presented on a
	basis that deconsolidates the Consolidated Funds. ENI also
	reflects pro forma compensation expense for compensation to our
	senior Carlyle professionals, which we have historically
	accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as
	employee compensation. Total Segment ENI equals the aggregate of
	ENI for all segments. ENI is evaluated regularly by management
	in making resource deployment decisions and in assessing
	performance of our four segments and for compensation. We
	believe that reporting ENI is helpful to understanding our
	business and that investors should review the same supplemental
	financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment
	performance. This measure supplements and should be considered
	in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations
	discussed further under Combined and Consolidated Results
	of Operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable Earnings
	is derived from our segment reported results and is an
	additional measure to assess performance and amounts potentially
	available for distribution from Carlyle Holdings to its equity
	holders. Distributable Earnings, which is a non-GAAP measure, is
	intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the
	effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds.
	Distributable Earnings is total ENI less unrealized performance
	fees, unrealized investment income and the corresponding
	unrealized performance fee compensation expense. For a
	discussion of the difference between Distributable Earnings and
	cash distributions during the historical periods presented, see
	Cash Distribution Policy.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings is
	a component of ENI and is used to measure our operating
	profitability exclusive of performance fees, investment income
	from investments in our funds and performance fee-related
	compensation. Accordingly, fee related earnings reflect the
	ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and
	operating expenses from fee revenues other than performance
	fees. Fee related earnings are reported as part of our segment
	results. We use fee related earnings from operations to measure
	our profitability from fund management fees. See Note 14 to
	the combined and consolidated financial statements included
	elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 





	Operating
	Metrics





	 


	We monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the
	alternative asset management industry.


	 




	Fee-earning
	Assets under Management




	 


	Fee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to
	the assets we manage from which we derive recurring fund
	management fees. Our fee-earning AUM generally equals the sum of:


	 


	(a) for carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles
	where the investment period has not expired, the amount of
	limited partner capital commitments and for fund of funds
	vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments
	during the commitment period (see Fee-





	113








	 






	earning AUM based on capital commitments in the table
	below for the amount of this component at each period);


	 


	(b) for substantially all carry funds and certain
	co-investment vehicles where the investment period has expired,
	the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital (see
	Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital in the
	table below for the amount of this component at each period);


	 


	(c) the gross amount of aggregate collateral balance at
	par, adjusted for defaulted or discounted collateral, of our
	CLOs and the reference portfolio notional amount of our
	synthetic CLOs (see Fee-earning AUM based on collateral
	balances, at par in the table below for the amount of this
	component at each period);


	 


	(d) the external investor portion of the net asset value
	(pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit
	funds, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic and other
	hedge funds and certain structured credit funds (see
	Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value in the
	table below for the amount of this component at each
	period); and


	 


	(e) for fund of funds vehicles and certain carry funds
	where the investment period has expired, the lower of cost or
	fair value of invested capital (see Fee-earning AUM based
	on lower of cost or fair value and other in the table
	below for the amount of this component at each period).


	 


	The table below details fee-earning AUM by its respective
	components at each period.

	Assets
	under Management





	 


	Assets under management or AUM refers to the assets we manage.
	Our AUM equals the sum of the following:


	 


	(a) the fair value of the capital invested in our carry
	funds, co-investment vehicles and fund of funds vehicles plus
	the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those
	funds and vehicles (including our commitments to those funds and
	vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and
	employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to
	those funds and vehicles;


	 


	(b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance at par of
	our CLOs and the reference portfolio notional amount of our
	synthetic CLOs; and


	 


	(c) the net asset value of our long/short credit
	(pre-redemptions and subscriptions), emerging markets,
	multi-product macroeconomic and other hedge funds and certain
	structured credit funds.


	 


	Our carry funds are closed-ended funds and investors are not
	able to redeem their interests under the fund partnership
	agreements.


	 


	For our carry funds, co-investment vehicles and fund of funds
	vehicles, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital
	invested, whereas fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital
	commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital,
	depending on whether the investment period for the fund has
	expired. As such, fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM
	when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is
	less than the cost of those investments.


	 


	Our calculations of fee-earning AUM and AUM may differ from the
	calculations of other alternative asset managers and, as a
	result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures
	presented by others. In addition, our calculation of AUM
	includes uncalled commitments to, and the





	115








	 






	fair value of invested capital in, our funds from Carlyle and
	our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or
	invested capital are subject to management or performance fees.
	Our calculations of fee-earning AUM or AUM are not based on any
	definition of fee-earning AUM or AUM that is set forth in the
	agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.


	 


	We generally use fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes
	in the assets from which we earn management fees. Total AUM
	tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising
	performance as it reflects assets at fair value plus available
	uncalled capital.


	 





	Available
	Capital





	 


	Available capital, commonly known as dry powder, for
	our carry funds refers to the amount of capital commitments
	available to be called for investments. Amounts previously
	called may be added back to available capital following certain
	distributions. Expired Available Capital occurs when
	a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can
	no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any
	remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either
	recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the
	follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees
	and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM
	calculation.

	Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting

	U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and
	termination of funds. Pursuant to revised consolidation
	guidance, effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated CLOs where
	through our management contract and other interests we are
	deemed to hold a controlling financial interest. On December
	31, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Claren Road and
	consolidated its operations and certain of its managed funds
	from that date forward. In addition, on July 1, 2011, we
	completed the acquisitions of ESG and AlpInvest and consolidated
	these entities as well as certain of their managed funds from
	that date forward. As further described below, the consolidation
	of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other
	income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of
	Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains (losses) of
	Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
	compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, and for the
	year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended
	December 31, 2009. The consolidation of these funds had no
	effect on net income attributable to Carlyle Group for the
	periods presented.

	Year
	Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2010





	 




	Revenues




	 


	Total revenues were $2,845.3 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011, an increase of 2% over total revenues in
	2010. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an
	increase in interest and other income of Consolidated Funds and
	fund management fees which increased $261.4 million and $145.2
	million, respectively. The increase in revenues was partially
	offset by a decrease in performance fees of $360.4 million.


	 



	Fund Management Fees.

	  Fund management
	fees increased $145.2 million, or 19%, to
	$915.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
	compared to 2010. In addition, fund management fees from
	consolidated funds increased $61.6 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. These fees
	eliminate upon consolidation of these funds.


	 


	Approximately $195.5 million of the $206.8 million
	increase was due to incremental management fees resulting from
	the acquisitions of ESG and AlpInvest in July 2011, the
	acquisition of Claren Road in December 2010, and from acquired
	CLO contracts from Stanfield and Mizuho in the second half of
	2010. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011,
	management fees increased as a result of new capital raised for
	one of our U.S. real estate funds and our South America buyout
	fund. Fund management fees include transaction and portfolio
	advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $75.7 million and
	$50.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively. The $25.7 million increase in
	transaction and portfolio advisory fees resulted from greater
	investment activity during 2011 as compared to 2010. These fee
	increases were offset by non-recurring management fees earned in
	2010 from final closings of two corporate private equity funds
	and lower fees from our third European buyout fund beginning in
	the fourth quarter of 2010.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 were $1,121.6 million
	compared to $1,482.0 million in 2010. In addition,
	performance fees from consolidated funds increased $37.0 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010.
	These fees eliminate upon consolidation. The performance fees
	recorded in 2011 and 2010 were due principally to increases in
	the fair value of the underlying funds, which increased
	approximately 16% and 34% in total remaining value during 2011
	and 2010, respectively. The net appreciation in the fair value
	of the investments was driven by improved asset performance and
	operating projections as well as increases in market
	comparables. Approximately $845.8 million and
	$1,259.0 million of performance fees for the years ended
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were generated by
	our Corporate Private Equity segment. Performance fees for the
	years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were
	$145.9 million and $144.6 million for the Global
	Market Strategies segment, and $150.4 million and
	$78.4 million for the Real Assets segment, respectively.
	Performance fees for the Fund of Funds Solutions segment, which
	was established upon the completion of the acquisition of
	AlpInvest, were $(20.5) million for the period from July 1,
	2011 through December 31, 2011. Further, approximately
	$964.2 million of our performance fees for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 were related to CP V and CP IV.


	 



	Investment Income (Loss).

	  Investment income of
	$78.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011
	increased 8% over 2010. The $5.8 million increase relates
	primarily to appreciation of investments in our funds that are
	not consolidated. In addition, investment income from
	Consolidated Funds increased $5.7 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily from
	the increase in fair value of our investments in the equity
	tranches of our CLOs. This income is eliminated upon
	consolidation.


	 



	Interest and Other Income.

	  Interest and other
	income decreased $5.6 million to $15.8 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $21.4 million
	in 2010.


	 



	Interest and Other Income of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Interest and other income of Consolidated
	Funds was $714.0 million in the year ended
	December 31, 2011, an increase of $261.4 million from
	$452.6 million in 2010. This increase relates primarily to
	the acquired CLOs of Stanfield and Mizuho as well as the
	consolidated funds associated with the acquisitions of ESG,
	AlpInvest, and Claren Road.





	119








	 






	The CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in
	bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and
	generate other income from consent and amendment fees.
	Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs together
	with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains
	(losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related
	funds limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is
	allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such
	amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to
	Carlyle Group.


	 




	Expenses




	 


	Expenses were $1,347.1 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011, an increase of $273.3 million from
	$1,073.8 million in 2010. The increase in expenses is
	partially due to the acquisitions that occurred in 2011 and the
	second half of 2010. The increase is due primarily to increases
	in general, administrative and other expenses and interest and
	other expenses of Consolidated Funds, which increased $146.3
	million and $219.8 million, respectively. The increase was
	partially offset by a decrease from the non-recurring expense
	associated with the equity issued for affiliate debt financing
	of $214.0 million recorded in 2010.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 increased $48.9 million, or 11%, from
	$429.0 million in 2010 to $477.9 million in 2011. The increase
	was primarily driven by base compensation, which increased
	primarily from the increase in headcount from 2010 to 2011,
	including additional professionals from the acquisitions of ESG,
	AlpInvest, and Claren Road. All compensation to senior Carlyle
	professionals is accounted for as equity distributions in our
	combined and consolidated financial statements. Had such amounts
	been accounted for as compensation expense, then total expenses
	would have been $2,018.6 million and $1,842.0 million
	in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
	respectively, representing an increase of $176.6 million
	due primarily to increases in general, administrative and other
	expenses of $146.3 million and interest and other expenses of
	Consolidated Funds of $219.8 million, offset by a decrease from
	the non-recurring expense associated with the equity issued for
	affiliate debt financing of $214.0 million recorded in 2010.


	 



	Compensation and Benefits.

	  Base compensation
	and benefits increased $109.3 million, or 41%, in the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, which
	primarily relates to the acquisitions of ESG, AlpInvest, and
	Claren Road and the addition of their professionals. The balance
	of the increase primarily reflects the increase in other
	personnel and increases in base compensation reflecting
	promotions and merit pay adjustments. Performance related
	compensation expense decreased $60.4 million in the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, of which
	$179.1 million was an increase in realized performance fee
	related compensation and $239.5 million was a decrease in
	unrealized performance fee related compensation. Compensation
	and benefits excludes amounts earned by senior Carlyle
	professionals for compensation and carried interest allocated to
	our investment professionals as such amounts are accounted for
	as distributions from equity. Base compensation and benefits
	attributable to senior Carlyle professionals was
	$243.3 million and $197.5 million and performance
	related compensation attributable to senior Carlyle
	professionals was $428.2 million and $570.7 million in
	the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
	Base compensation and benefits would have been
	$617.8 million and $462.7 million and performance
	related compensation would have been $531.6 million and
	$734.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively, had compensation attributable to senior
	Carlyle professionals been treated as compensation expense. As
	adjusted for amounts related to senior Carlyle professionals,
	performance related compensation as a percentage of performance
	fees was 47% and 50% in the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively. Total compensation and benefits would
	have been $1,149.4 million and $1,197.2 million in the
	years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, had
	compensation attributable to senior Carlyle professionals been
	treated as compensation expense.


	 



	General, Administrative and Other
	Expenses.

	  General, administrative and other
	expenses increased $146.3 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This increase was
	driven primarily by (i) approximately $57.3 million
	increase in amortization expense associated with intangible
	assets acquired in 2011 and 2010; (ii) an increase in
	professional fees for legal and accounting of approximately
	$15.7 million; (iii) an increase in information
	technology expenses of





	120








	 






	$11.1 million; (iv) an increase in office rent of
	$7.3 million; (v) a negative variance of
	$21.3 million related to foreign currency remeasurements;
	and (vi) approximately $32.1 million of expenses
	related to the operations of Claren Road, AlpInvest and ESG.


	 



	Interest.

	  Our interest expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 was $60.6 million, an increase
	of $42.8 million from 2010. This increase was primarily
	attributable to $33.6 million of interest expense recorded
	in 2011 on our subordinated notes payable to Mubadala which we
	issued in December 2010. In October 2011 and
	March 2012, we used borrowings on the revolving credit
	facility of our existing senior secured credit facility to
	redeem the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the
	subordinated notes payable to Mubadala. As of March 2012,
	the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala have been fully
	redeemed. The balance of the increase results from higher
	borrowings under our refinanced term loan and our revolving
	credit facility and indebtedness incurred in connection with the
	acquisition of Claren Road.


	 



	Interest and Other Expenses of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Interest and other expenses of
	Consolidated Funds increased $219.8 million in the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 due primarily
	to the acquisition of CLOs from Stanfield and Mizuho in 2010 and
	the consolidated Claren Road and ESG funds. The CLOs incur
	interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses
	consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional
	fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs
	together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment
	gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the
	related funds limited partners or CLO investors and
	therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests.
	Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income
	attributable to Carlyle Group.


	 



	Other Non-operating Expenses.

	  Other
	non-operating expenses of $32.0 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 reflect a $28.5 million fair value
	adjustment on our subordinated notes payable to Mubadala. In
	October 2011 and March 2012, we used borrowings on the
	revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit
	facility to redeem the $500 million aggregate principal
	amount of the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala. As of
	March 2012, the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala have
	been fully redeemed. Also included in non-operating expenses are
	$3.5 million of fair value adjustments on the performance
	earn-outs related to the acquisitions of Claren Road, ESG and
	AlpInvest. See Note 3 to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 




	Net
	Investment Losses of Consolidated Funds




	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2011, net investment losses
	of Consolidated Funds was $323.3 million, as compared to
	$245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
	This balance is predominantly driven by our consolidated CLOs,
	hedge funds and AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, and to a
	lesser extent by the other consolidated funds in our financial
	statements. The amount reflects the net gain or loss on the fair
	value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities of our
	consolidated CLOs. The components of net investment losses of
	consolidated funds for the respective periods are comprised of
	the following:

	The realized and unrealized investment gains/losses include the
	appreciation/depreciation of the equity investments within the
	consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles and corporate





	121








	 






	private equity funds, the appreciation/depreciation of
	investments made by our consolidated hedge funds, and the
	appreciation/depreciation of CLO investments in loans and bonds.
	The losses on the liabilities of the CLOs reflects the fair
	value adjustment on the debt of the CLOs. The liabilities of the
	CLOs have a lower degree of market liquidity than the CLO
	investments in bonds and loans and accordingly, their fair value
	changes will not necessarily be correlated. During the year
	ended December 31, 2011, the liabilities appreciated more
	than the investments, creating a net investment loss. Also
	contributing to the net investment losses for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 was approximately $75.1 million of
	net investment losses attributable to the consolidated funds
	from the acquisitions of Claren Road, ESG, and AlpInvest.


	 




	Net Loss
	Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated
	Entities




	 


	Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities was $202.6 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 compared to $66.2 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2010. These amounts are primarily
	attributable to the net earnings or losses of the Consolidated
	Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to
	the related funds limited partners or CLO investors.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the net loss of
	our Consolidated Funds was approximately $208.8 million.
	This loss was substantially due to our consolidated CLOs and the
	consolidated funds associated with the Claren Road, ESG, and
	AlpInvest acquisitions. The consolidated CLOs generated a net
	loss of $122.0 million in 2011. The CLO liabilities
	appreciated in value greater than the CLO investments in loans
	and bonds, thereby creating a net loss. Also, the net loss from
	the consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles was
	approximately $220.4 million. The amount of the loss was
	offset by approximately $84.4 million of income allocated
	to the investors in the consolidated hedge funds which are
	reflected in redeemable non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities on our combined and consolidated balance
	sheet. This compares to the net loss of our Consolidated Funds
	of $76.9 million for the year ended December 31,
	2010. The 2010 loss was driven by the losses incurred on the
	CLO liabilities as the liabilities appreciated in value greater
	than the investments of the CLOs. The investment loss was
	reduced by interest income in excess of interest expense from
	the CLOs. The consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles and
	hedge funds were acquired with our acquisitions of AlpInvest,
	ESG, and Claren Road and accordingly did not impact the 2010
	results.


	 





	Year
	Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2009





	 




	Revenues




	 


	Total revenues were $2,798.9 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately
	$1.5 billion compared to total 2009 revenues of
	$1,317.8 million. The increase in revenues was primarily
	attributable to an increase in performance fees of
	$985.3 million to $1,482.0 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2010 and an increase of $451.9 million in
	interest and other income of Consolidated Funds. Investment
	income also increased $67.6 million over 2009 while
	interest and other income decreased $5.9 million in 2010
	and fund management fees decreased $17.8 million.


	 



	Fund Management Fees.

	  Fund management
	fees decreased $17.8 million, or 2%, to $770.3 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The
	decrease in fund management fees was due to the consolidation of
	CLOs beginning in 2010 as a result of revisions to the
	accounting standards governing consolidations. The management
	fees from the consolidated CLOs eliminate upon consolidation of
	these funds. Fund management fees from consolidated CLOs of
	$43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
	were eliminated from our financial statements. Fund management
	fees prior to elimination increased to $813.6 million for
	2010 from $788.1 million in 2009, an increase of 3% or
	$25.5 million. Fund management fees include transaction and
	portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $50.0 million
	and $32.9 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
	$25.5 million increase in total fund management fees was
	due primarily to the acquisition of CLO contracts from Stanfield
	and Mizuho which contributed approximately $6.1 million
	during 2010 and the increase in transaction and portfolio





	122








	 






	advisory fees of $17.1 million, net of rebate offsets. This
	increase in transaction and portfolio advisory fees resulted
	from an increase in investment activity during 2010.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees recognized
	in 2010 were $1,482.0 million compared to
	$496.7 million in 2009. The increase in performance fees
	was due principally to increases in the fair value of the
	underlying funds which increased in value a total of
	approximately 34% during 2010. The net appreciation in the fair
	value of the investments was driven by improved asset
	performance and operating projections of our funds
	portfolio companies as well as increases in market comparables.
	Approximately $668.7 million of 2010 performance fees are
	related to one of our funds in our Corporate Private Equity
	business.


	 



	Investment Income (Loss).

	  Investment income
	for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
	$72.6 million, and was primarily attributable to our equity
	investments in our funds and trading securities. Investment
	income increased $67.6 million as compared to 2009, due
	principally to increases in the fair value of our funds
	net assets. Investment income in 2010 excludes
	$19.0 million of income which is primarily attributable to
	our investments in the equity tranches of our consolidated CLOs.
	This income is eliminated upon consolidation.


	 



	Interest and Other Income.

	  Interest and other
	income decreased $5.9 million from 2009 to
	$21.4 million in 2010.


	 



	Interest and Other Income of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Interest and other income of Consolidated
	Funds was $452.6 million in 2010, up from $0.7 million
	in 2009. This income relates primarily to our CLOs which we were
	required to begin consolidating in 2010 upon a change in U.S.
	GAAP. The CLOs generate interest income primarily from
	investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of
	discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment
	fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs
	together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment
	gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the
	related funds limited partners or CLO investors and
	therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests.
	Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income
	attributable to Carlyle Group.


	 




	Expenses




	 


	Total expenses were $1,073.8 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2010, an increase of $468.2 million from
	$605.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
	The significant increase in expenses was due primarily to a
	$214.0 million expense associated with the issuance of the
	subordinated notes to Mubadala in December 2010, as well as the
	consolidation of our CLOs beginning on January 1, 2010 as a
	result of revisions to the accounting standards governing
	consolidations and the corresponding increase in interest and
	other expenses of Consolidated Funds, which increased
	$232.6 million in 2010 from $0.7 million in 2009. Also
	contributing to the increase in expenses was an increase in
	compensation and benefits related to performance fees which
	increased $79.6 million due to higher performance fees in
	2010 as previously described.


	 



	Compensation and Benefits.

	  Base compensation
	and benefits remained relatively unchanged during 2010 with a
	net increase of $1.0 million, or less than 1%. Performance
	fee related compensation expense increased $79.6 million of
	which $45.5 million was realized in 2010 and
	$34.1 million is due to the increase in unrealized
	performance fees. Compensation and benefits excludes amounts
	earned by senior Carlyle professionals for compensation and
	carried interest allocated to our investment professionals as
	such amounts are accounted for as distributions from equity.
	Base compensation and benefits attributable to senior Carlyle
	professionals was $197.5 million and $182.2 million
	and performance related compensation attributable to senior
	Carlyle professionals was $570.7 million and
	$157.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Base
	compensation and benefits would have been $462.7 million
	and $446.4 million and performance related compensation
	would have been $734.5 million and $241.7 million in
	2010 and 2009, respectively, had compensation attributable to
	senior Carlyle professionals been treated as compensation
	expense. As adjusted for amounts related to senior Carlyle
	professionals, base compensation and benefits increased 4%
	primarily reflecting merit pay adjustments. As adjusted for
	amounts related to senior Carlyle professionals, performance
	related compensation as a percentage





	123








	 






	of performance fees was 50% and 49% in 2010 and 2009,
	respectively. Total compensation and benefits would have been
	$1,197.2 million and $688.1 million in 2010 and 2009,
	respectively, had compensation attributable to senior Carlyle
	professionals been treated as compensation expense.


	 



	General, Administrative and Other
	Expenses.

	  General, administrative and other
	expenses decreased $59.4 million compared to the year ended
	December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven by (i) the
	incurrence in 2009 of a $20 million charge in connection
	with the resolution of an inquiry by the Office of the Attorney
	General of the State of New York regarding the use of placement
	agents by various asset managers, including Carlyle, to solicit
	New York public pension funds for private equity and hedge fund
	commitments (the NYAG Settlement),
	(ii) approximately $4.8 million of expenses in 2009
	associated with the shut down of our Latin America real estate
	fund and (iii) a positive variance of $34 million
	related to foreign currency remeasurements. In addition,
	severance and lease termination expenses were approximately
	$20 million less in 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease in
	expense was substantially offset by higher professional fees in
	2010.


	 



	Interest.

	  Our interest expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2010 was $17.8 million, a decrease
	of $12.8 million from the prior year. This decrease was
	primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings during most of
	2010 until we refinanced our term loan in November 2010 and
	borrowed $494 million of subordinated debt in December
	2010. In connection with these refinancing transactions we
	incurred $2.5 million in early extinguishment charges in
	2010 as compared to a gain of $10.7 million from early
	repayment of debt in 2009.


	 



	Interest and Other Expenses of Consolidated
	Funds.

	  Beginning on January 1, 2010 we were
	required to consolidate our CLOs as a result of revisions to the
	accounting standards governing consolidations. The loans of our
	Consolidated Funds have recourse only to the assets of the
	Consolidated Funds. Interest expense and other expenses of
	Consolidated Funds increased $232.6 million in 2010 from
	$0.7 million in 2009. The CLOs incur interest expense on
	their loans payable, and incur other expenses consisting of
	trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees.
	Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs together
	with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains
	(losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related
	funds limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is
	allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such
	amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to
	Carlyle Group.


	 



	Equity Issued for Affiliate Debt Financing.

	  In
	December 2010, we issued equity interests to Mubadala in
	connection with the placement of the subordinated notes. Because
	we elected the fair value option to account for the subordinated
	notes, we expensed the fair value of the equity interests as an
	upfront debt issuance cost totaling $214.0 million.


	 




	Net
	Investment Losses of Consolidated Funds




	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2010, net investment losses
	of Consolidated Funds was a loss of $245.4 million, an
	increase of $211.6 million compared to the loss of
	$33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
	The Consolidated Funds include our CLOs beginning in 2010 as a
	result of





	124








	 






	revisions to the accounting standards governing consolidations.
	The components of net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated
	Funds for the respective periods are comprised of the following:

	The realized and unrealized investment gains include the
	appreciation of the equity investments within the consolidated
	corporate private equity funds as well as the appreciation of
	CLO investments in loans and bonds for 2010. The gains (losses)
	on the liabilities of the CLOs reflects the fair value
	adjustment on the debt of the CLOs. The liabilities of the CLOs
	have a lower degree of market liquidity than the CLO investments
	in bonds and loans and accordingly, their fair value changes
	will not necessarily be correlated. During the year ended
	December 31, 2010, the liabilities appreciated more than
	the investments, creating a net investment loss. The comparative
	2009 activity only includes the effect of consolidated corporate
	private equity funds.


	 




	Net Loss
	Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated
	Entities




	 


	Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities was $66.2 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2010 compared to $30.5 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily
	attributable to the net loss of the Consolidated Funds, which is
	substantially all allocated to the related funds limited
	partners or CLO investors. During the year ended
	December 31, 2010, the net loss of our Consolidated Funds
	was approximately $76.9 million and was substantially
	impacted by our consolidation of CLOs beginning in January 2010
	due to a change in accounting standards. The 2010 loss was
	driven by the losses incurred on the CLO liabilities as the
	liabilities appreciated in value greater than the investments of
	the CLOs. The investment loss was reduced by interest income in
	excess of interest expense from the CLOs. This compares to a net
	loss of $33.8 million from our Consolidated Funds in 2009
	which is entirely due to net investment losses.



	 




	Non-GAAP Financial
	Measures





	 


	The following table sets forth information in the format used by
	management when making resource deployment decisions and in
	assessing performance of our segments. These non-GAAP financial
	measures are presented for the three years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The table below shows our
	total segment Economic Net Income which is composed of the sum
	of Fee Related Earnings, Net Performance Fees and Investment
	Income. This analysis excludes the effect of consolidated funds,
	amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related
	expenses, treats compensation attributable to senior Carlyle
	professionals as compensation expense and adjusts for

	Adjustments to performance fees and
	investment income relate to amounts earned from the Consolidated
	Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP consolidation
	but were included in the segment results, and amounts
	attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated
	entities, which were excluded from the segment results.
	Adjustments to performance fee related compensation expense
	relate to the inclusion of partner compensation in the segment
	results. Adjustments are also included in these financial
	statement captions to reflect Carlyles 55% economic
	interest in Claren Road and ESG and Carlyles 60% interest
	in AlpInvest in the segment results.

	investment income (loss) relate to amounts earned from the
	Consolidated Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP
	consolidation but were included in the segment results, and
	amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities, which were excluded from the segment
	results. Adjustments to performance fee related compensation
	expense relate to the inclusion of partner compensation in the
	segment results.

	Segment
	Analysis





	 


	Discussed below is our ENI for our segments for the periods
	presented. We began reporting on our Fund of Funds Solutions
	segment in the quarter ending September 30, 2011. See
	 Recent Transactions and Unaudited
	Pro Forma Financial Information. Our segment information
	is reflected in the manner utilized by our senior management to
	make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate
	resources.


	 


	For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are
	presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds.
	As a result, segment revenues from management fees, performance
	fees and investment income are greater than those presented on a
	consolidated GAAP basis because fund management fees recognized
	in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are
	eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated
	GAAP basis. Furthermore, expenses are lower than related amounts
	presented on a consolidated GAAP basis due to the exclusion of
	fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds. Finally,
	ENI includes a compensation charge for senior Carlyle
	professionals, which is reflected in both the base compensation
	expense and in performance fee related compensation. As such,
	compensation and benefits expense is greater in ENI than in our
	historical GAAP results where all compensation earned by senior
	Carlyle professionals is accounted for as distributions from
	equity.

	Year
	Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2010





	 


	Total fee revenues were $577.3 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011, representing an increase of
	$3.3 million, or 0.6%, over 2010. This increase reflects a
	$13.2 million increase in net transaction fees and an
	increase in net portfolio advisory fees of $16.4 million
	offset by a decrease in fund management fees of
	$26.3 million. The increase in net transaction fees
	resulted from higher investment activity in 2011 compared to
	2010. Despite an increase in our weighted-average management fee
	rate from 1.28% to 1.30% at December 31, 2011, a decrease
	of approximately $0.9 billion of fee-earning AUM resulted
	in a decrease in fund management fees. This is due largely to
	distributions from several buyout funds outside of their
	investment period.


	 


	Interest and other income was $9.2 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011, a decrease from $14.8 million
	in 2010.

	Total compensation and benefits was $693.5 million and
	$898.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively. Performance fee related compensation
	expense was $440.4 million and $660.8 million, or 52%
	of performance fees, for the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively.


	 


	Direct base compensation expense increased $15.5 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2011, or 7% over 2010,
	primarily reflecting adjustments to base compensation and
	bonuses as headcount increased. General, administrative and
	other indirect compensation increased $70.4 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. The
	expense increase primarily reflected allocated overhead costs
	related to our continued investment in infrastructure and back
	office support.


	 


	Interest expense increased $26.1 million, or 229%, for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This
	increase was primarily attributable to interest expense recorded
	in 2011 on our subordinated notes payable to Mubadala, which we
	issued in December 2010. In October 2011 and March 2012, we used
	borrowings on the revolving credit facility of our existing
	senior secured credit facility to redeem the $500 million
	aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes payable to
	Mubadala. As of March 2012, the subordinated notes payable to
	Mubadala have been fully redeemed. The increase was also due to
	higher borrowings under our refinanced term loan and our
	revolving credit facility.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$514.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011,
	reflecting a 37% decrease as compared to ENI of
	$819.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
	The decrease in ENI in 2011 was driven by a $189.6 million
	decrease in net performance fees as compared to 2010 and
	increases in interest expense and our continued investment in
	infrastructure and back office support which resulted in a
	$114.3 million decrease in fee related earnings.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	were $57.4 million for the year ended December 31,
	2011, as compared to $171.7 million for 2010, representing
	a decrease of $114.3 million. The decrease in fee related
	earnings is primarily attributable to a net increase in expenses
	primarily reflecting allocated overhead costs related to our
	continued investment in infrastructure and back office support,
	as well as higher interest expense associated with the
	subordinated notes payable to Mubadala.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees decreased
	$410.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
	compared to 2010. Performance fees of $853.6 million and
	$1,263.6 million are inclusive of performance fees reversed
	of approximately $(246.4) million and $0 during the years
	ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Performance
	fees for this segment by type of fund are as follows:

	The $853.6 million in performance fees for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 was primarily driven by performance fees
	for CP IV of $472.3 million and CP V of
	$491.9 million, offset by performance fees for CAP II of
	$(82.2) million and CAP I (including

	co-investments)

	of $(69.0) million. During 2011, CP V surpassed its
	preferred return hurdles, which CP IV had accomplished in 2010.
	The total 2011 appreciation in the remaining value of assets for
	funds in this segment was approximately 16%. Approximately 64%
	and 25%, respectively, of the remaining fair value of the
	investment portfolios of CP IV and CP V is held in
	publicly traded companies. Accordingly, this portion of the
	portfolio will move in valuation in accordance with changes in
	public market prices for the equity of these





	131








	 






	companies. Comparatively, the $1,263.6 million of
	performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
	primarily driven by increases in net asset values of two of our
	U.S. buyout funds (CP III and CP IV), representing
	performance fees of $147.9 million and $668.7 million,
	respectively, and CAP II of $173.4 million.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2011, net performance
	fees were $413.2 million or 48% of performance fees and
	$189.6 million less than the net performance fees in 2010.


	 



	Investment Income.

	  Investment income for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 was $43.5 million
	compared to $44.8 million in 2010. During the year ended
	December 31, 2011, realized investment income was
	$43.2 million as compared to $4.2 million in 2010.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	increased 84% for the year ended December 31, 2011 to
	$566.0 million from $307.2 million in 2010. This
	primarily reflects realized net performance fees of
	$465.4 million in 2011 compared to $131.3 million in
	2010, offset by a decrease in fee related earnings of
	$114.3 million from 2010 to 2011.


	 





	Year
	Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2009





	 


	Total fee revenues were $574.0 million in 2010 representing
	an increase of $10.1 million, or 2%, over 2009. This
	increase was driven almost entirely by net transaction fees
	which increased 79% or $9.5 million over 2009 reflecting
	the higher investment activity in 2010 as compared to 2009. Fund
	management fees and portfolio advisory fees were largely
	unchanged from 2009. The weighted-average management fee rate
	decreased from 1.32% to 1.28% at December 31, 2010 due
	primarily to a reduction in the fee rate for our third European
	buyout fund. The effect of this decrease will primarily impact
	our fees earned in 2011 and 2012.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits was $898.4 million and
	$488.6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Performance
	fee related compensation expense was $660.8 million and
	$261.2 million, or 52% and 53% of performance fees, in 2010
	and 2009, respectively.


	 


	Direct base compensation expense increased $10.2 million,
	or 4%, over 2009, primarily as the result of adjustments to base
	compensation and bonuses as headcount remained relatively
	unchanged between years. General, administrative and other
	indirect compensation of $168.1 million for 2010 was
	relatively consistent with 2009.


	 


	Interest expense decreased $8.4 million, or 42%, over the
	comparable period in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to
	lower outstanding borrowings during most of 2010 until we
	refinanced our term loan in November 2010 and borrowed
	$494 million of subordinated debt in December 2010.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$819.3 million for 2010, or 205% of our 2009 ENI of
	$400.4 million for this business. The composition of ENI in
	2010 was substantially impacted by the growth in net performance
	fees and to a lesser extent by the improvement in investment
	income. Net performance fees and investment income represented
	74% and 5% of segment ENI in 2010 as compared to 58% and 2% in
	2009, respectively.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	increased $12.2 million in 2010 over 2009 to a total of
	$171.7 million.

	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees of $1,263.6
	million and $495.3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, are
	inclusive of performance fees reversed of $0 in 2010 and
	approximately $(83.0) million during 2009. Performance fees

	During 2010, investments in our Corporate Private Equity funds
	appreciated approximately 46% reflecting both improved
	performance and outlook, as well as higher market comparables.
	Most significantly, during 2010, CP IV surpassed its
	preferred return hurdles and we recognized $668.7 million
	of performance fees in 2010, representing 53% of the performance
	fees for this segment. CAP II generated performance fees of
	$173.4 million and CP III generated performance fees of
	$147.9 million, in each case driven by significant
	appreciation in value of the funds assets. Approximately
	42% of the remaining asset value in CP III at December 31,
	2010 was in publicly listed companies, whereas the public
	portfolio in CAP II was only 31% at December 31, 2010.


	 


	In 2010, net performance fees were 48% of performance fees as
	compared to 47% in 2009. Net performance fees increased
	$368.7 million in 2010 over 2009.


	 



	Investment Income.

	  Investment income in 2010
	was $44.8 million of which $40.6 million was
	unrealized. Investment income increased $38.0 million from
	2009 reflecting the appreciation in the underlying funds.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	nearly doubled to $307.2 million in 2010 from
	$159.7 million in 2009. The 2010 distributable earnings
	growth was driven primarily by an increase in realized net
	performance fees of $128.4 million and an increase in fee
	related earnings of $12.2 million.

	Fee-earning AUM was $38.0 billion at December 31, 2011, a
	decrease of $0.9 billion, or 2%, compared to $38.9 billion at
	December 31, 2010. Inflows of $1.0 billion were primarily
	related to limited partner commitments raised by our South
	America buyout fund (CSABF I), our first Renminbi denominated
	buyout fund (CBPF), our equity opportunities fund (CEOF), and
	our second global financial services group (CGFSP II). Outflows
	of $1.7 billion were principally a result of distributions from
	several buyout funds that were outside of their investment
	period. Distributions from funds still in the investment period
	do not impact fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on
	commitments and not invested capital. Changes in fair value have
	no material impact on fee-earning AUM for Corporate Private
	Equity as substantially all of the funds generate management
	fees based on either commitments or invested capital at cost,
	neither of which is impacted by fair value movements.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $38.9 billion at December 31,
	2010, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 4%, compared to
	$40.4 billion at December 31, 2009. Inflows of
	$1.5 billion were primarily related to limited partner
	commitments raised by CAP III, CSABF I, CGFSP I and
	CBPF. Outflows of $2.5 billion were principally a result of
	distributions from several of the funds outside of their
	investment period.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $40.4 billion at December 31,
	2009, an increase of $0.2 billion, less than 1%, compared
	to $40.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Inflows of
	$0.9 billion were primarily related to limited partner
	commitments raised by CAP III, CSABF I, CGFSP I and
	our fourth Asia growth fund (CAGP IV). Outflows of
	$0.8 billion were principally a result of distributions
	from several of our buyout funds and related co-investments, all
	of which were outside of their investment period.

	Total AUM was $51.1 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of
	$5.2 billion, or 9%, compared to $56.3 billion at December 31,
	2010. This decrease was primarily driven by $12.5 billion of
	distributions, of which approximately $1.5 billion was recycled
	back into available capital. This decrease was partially offset
	by $4.6 billion of market appreciation across our portfolio,
	which experienced a 16% increase in value over the year due to
	an 18% increase across our buyout funds, offset by an 8%
	decrease across our growth capital funds. The 18% increase in
	our buyout funds was primarily driven by appreciation in CP IV
	and CP V partially offset by depreciation in our Asia buyout and
	growth capital funds. Additionally, we raised new commitments of
	$1.6 billion for CSABF I, CBPF, CEOF, CGFSP II and
	various U.S. buyout co-investment vehicles, which further offset
	this decrease.


	 


	Total AUM was $56.3 billion at December 31, 2010, an
	increase of $7.5 billion, or 15%, compared to
	$48.8 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase was
	primarily driven by $10.7 billion of market appreciation
	due to a 46% appreciation in valuations across the segment. This
	appreciation was due to a 48% increase in value across our
	buyout funds and a 24% increase in our growth capital funds. The
	buyout appreciation was mostly driven by increases in value in
	all of our large buyout funds, including CP IV, CP V, one
	of our European buyout funds (CEP II) and CAP II.
	Additionally, we raised new commitments of $2.3 billion
	primarily for CAP III, CSABF I, CGFSP I and CBPF. This

	increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of
	distributions, of which approximately $0.7 billion was
	recycled back into available capital.


	 


	Total AUM was $48.8 billion at December 31, 2009, an
	increase of $3.6 billion, or 8%, compared to
	$45.2 billion at December 31, 2008. This increase was
	primarily driven by $4.2 billion of market appreciation
	across our portfolio due to a 9% increase in fund valuations
	during the period, representing an increase of 8% in our buyout
	funds and 19% in our growth capital funds. The majority of this
	appreciation occurred in our Asia buyout and growth capital
	funds and the related China Pacific co-investment.

	Fund performance information for our investment funds that have
	at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative
	equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2011,
	which we refer to as our significant funds is
	included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate
	an understanding of our results of operations for the periods
	presented. The fund return information reflected in this
	discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. and is also not necessarily indicative of
	the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in
	The Carlyle Group L.P. is not an investment in any of our funds.
	There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other
	existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See
	Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business
	Operations  The historical returns attributable to
	our funds, including those presented in this prospectus, should

	The returns presented herein
	represent those of the applicable Carlyle funds and not those of
	The Carlyle Group L.P.






	 





	(1)






	The data presented herein that
	provides inception to date performance results of
	our segments relates to the period following the formation of
	the first fund within each segment. For our Corporate Private
	Equity segment our first fund was formed in 1990.





	 





	(2)






	Represents the original cost of all
	capital called for investments since inception of the fund.





	 





	(3)






	Represents all realized proceeds
	combined with remaining fair value, before management fees,
	expenses and carried interest. Please see note 4 to the
	combined and consolidated financial statements for the years
	ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011
	appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for further information
	regarding managements determination of fair value.





	 





	(4)






	Multiple of invested capital
	(MOIC) represents total fair value, before
	management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by
	cumulative invested capital.





	 





	(5)






	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at
	least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet
	fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy
	involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC, when considered
	together with the other investment performance metrics
	presented, provides investors with meaningful information
	regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of
	investments where significant realization activity has not yet
	occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC have limitations as
	measures of investment performance, and should not be considered
	in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these
	measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and
	other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided
	above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive
	impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC in instances when the
	MOIC in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate
	MOIC. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC may
	not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly
	titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized
	performance information separately for funds that are still in
	the investment period because of the relatively insignificant
	level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the
	extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in
	the Realized/Partially Realized performance information
	presented for Total Corporate Private Equity.

	Fully invested funds are past the
	expiration date of the investment period as defined in the
	respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a
	successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor
	fund is categorized as fully invested.

	The data presented herein that
	provides inception to date performance results of
	our segments relates to the period following the formation of

	Equity segment, our first fund was formed in 1990.

	Gross Internal Rate of Return
	(IRR) represents the annualized IRR for the period
	indicated on limited partner invested capital based on
	contributions, distributions and unrealized value before
	management fees, expenses and carried interest.





	 





	(3)






	Net IRR represents the annualized
	IRR for the period indicated on limited partner invested capital
	based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after
	management fees, expenses and carried interest.

	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at
	least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet
	fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy
	involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR, when considered
	together with the other investment performance metrics
	presented, provides investors with meaningful information
	regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of
	investments where significant realization activity has not yet
	occurred. Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR have limitations
	as measures of investment performance, and should not be
	considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that
	these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage
	and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided
	above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive
	impact on Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR in instances
	when the Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than
	the aggregate Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially
	Realized Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other
	companies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present
	Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately
	for funds that are still in the investment period because of the
	relatively








	138








	 





















	insignificant level of realizations
	for funds of this type. However, to the extent such funds have
	had realizations, they are included in the Realized/Partially
	Realized performance information presented for Total Corporate
	Private Equity.

	Fully invested funds are past the

	Year
	Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2010





	 


	Total fee revenues were $157.4 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011, an increase of $2.2 million from
	2010. The increase in total fee revenues reflects an increase in
	fund management fees of $6.7 million, offset by a net
	decrease in transaction fees and portfolio advisory fees of





	139








	 






	$4.5 million. The increase in management fees reflects the
	capital raised for our sixth U.S. real estate fund
	(CRP VI). However, the lower effective rate on this fund
	resulted in a decrease in our weighted-average management fee
	rate to 1.22% at December 31, 2011 from 1.28% at
	December 31, 2010.


	 


	Interest and other income was $2.0 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011, a decrease from $4.9 million
	in 2010.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits was $79.8 million and
	$71.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively. Performance fee related compensation
	expense was $4.5 million and $(1.1) million for the
	years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
	Performance fees earned from the Riverstone funds are allocated
	solely to Carlyle and are not otherwise shared or allocated with
	our investment professionals. To date, performance related
	compensation expense in Real Assets reflects amounts earned
	primarily by our real estate investment professionals as we
	generally incur no compensation expense for Riverstone and we
	have not yet generated any performance fees or related
	compensation from our infrastructure fund. Accordingly,
	performance fee compensation as a percentage of performance fees
	is generally not a meaningful percentage for Real Assets.


	 


	Direct base compensation was $75.3 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $72.4 million
	for 2010. General, administrative and other indirect
	compensation increased $10.6 million to $79.8 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010.
	The expense increase primarily reflects allocated overhead costs
	related to our continued investment in infrastructure and back
	office support.


	 


	Interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 195%, for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This
	increase was primarily attributable to interest expense recorded
	in 2011 on our subordinated notes payable to Mubadala, which we
	issued in December 2010. In October 2011 and March 2012, we used
	borrowings on the revolving credit facility of our existing
	senior secured credit facility to redeem the $500 million
	aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes payable to
	Mubadala. As of March 2012, the subordinated notes payable to
	Mubadala have been fully redeemed. The increase was also due to
	higher borrowings under our refinanced term loan and our
	revolving credit facility.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$143.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011,
	an increase of $53.2 million from $90.7 million in
	2010. The improvement in ENI for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven
	by an increase in net performance fees of $75.1 million,
	partially offset by a decrease in fee related earnings of
	$21.6 million.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	decreased $21.6 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 to
	$(6.9) million. The decrease in fee related earnings is
	primarily attributable to an increase in expenses primarily
	reflecting allocated overhead costs related to our continued
	investment in infrastructure and back office support, as well as
	higher interest expense associated with the subordinated notes
	payable to Mubadala.


	 




	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees of
	$150.5 million and $69.8 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are inclusive of
	performance fees reversed of approximately $(18.6) million
	and $(47.4) million, respectively. Performance fees for
	this segment by type of fund are as follows:

	Performance fees for the years ended December 31, 2011 and
	2010 were primarily driven by performance fees related to one of
	our energy funds (Energy III) (including co-investments) of
	$79.4 million and $61.5 million, respectively, and our
	latest energy fund (Energy IV) of $42.6 million and
	$28.6 million, respectively. Investments in our Real Assets
	portfolio increased 16% during the year ended December 31,
	2011 with energy investments appreciating 21% and real estate
	investments appreciating 6%.


	 


	Net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2011
	were $146.0 million, representing an improvement of
	$75.1 million over $70.9 million in net performance
	fees for the year ended December 31, 2010.


	 



	Investment Income.

	  Investment income was
	$4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
	compared to $5.1 million in 2010.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	increased $72.1 million to $84.8 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 from $12.7 million in 2010.
	The increase was primarily due to a $93.0 million increase
	in realized net performance fees offset by a decrease in fee
	related earnings of $21.6 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010.


	 





	Year
	Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2009





	 


	Total fee revenues were $155.2 million in 2010 representing
	an increase of $1.4 million or 1% over 2009. The change in
	total fee revenues reflects the $7.8 million increase in
	net transaction and portfolio advisory fees offset by a decrease
	in management fees of $6.4 million. The increase in
	transaction fees reflects the increased investment activity in
	2010 while the decrease in management fees primarily reflects a
	decrease in fees from our European real estate funds and to a
	lesser extent from the shutdown of our Latin America real estate
	fund. Our weighted-average management fee rate decreased from
	1.37% to 1.28% over the period.


	 


	Interest and other income was $4.9 million in 2010
	representing a 66% decrease from $14.3 million in 2009. The
	decrease was largely due to the sale of a real estate colocation
	property at the end of 2009, the results of which were
	previously included in this business segment.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits was $71.3 million and
	$53.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Performance
	fee related compensation expense was $(1.1) million and
	$(20.7) million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.


	 


	Direct base compensation decreased $1.8 million to
	$72.4 million in 2010. General, administrative and other
	indirect compensation decreased 18%, or $15.0 million, in
	2010 compared to 2009. The net expense reduction reflects cost
	saving initiatives derived in part from closing our Latin
	America real estate initiative and favorable variances in
	foreign currency remeasurements in 2010.


	 


	Interest expense decreased $2.9 million, or 43%, over the
	comparable period in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to
	lower outstanding borrowings during most of 2010 until we
	refinanced our term loan in November 2010 and borrowed
	$494 million of subordinated debt in December 2010.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$90.7 million for 2010, an improvement of nearly 437% from
	$16.9 million in 2009 for this business. The improvement in
	ENI was primarily driven by the performance fees earned from our
	energy portfolio resulting in a $57.9 million increase in
	net performance fees. Fee related earnings and investment income
	contributed $11.7 million and $4.2 million,
	respectively to the improvement in ENI.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	were $14.7 million for 2010, an increase of
	$11.7 million over fee related earnings for 2009.

	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees of $69.8
	million and $(7.7) million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, are
	inclusive of performance fees reversed of approximately $(47.4)
	million and $(57.5) million, respectively. Performance fees for

	Performance fees increased $77.5 million from 2009 to 2010.
	Investments in our Real Assets portfolio increased 15% over 2009
	with energy investments appreciating 22% and real estate
	appreciating 4%. Although our overall real estate portfolio
	appreciated in 2010, the real estate funds that are generating
	performance fees did not appreciate in 2010 and accordingly,
	experienced performance fee reversals in 2010.


	 


	Net performance fees in 2010 were $70.9 million,
	representing an improvement of $57.9 million over
	$13.0 million in 2009.


	 



	Investment Income (Loss).

	  Investment income
	was $5.1 million in 2010 compared to $0.9 million in
	2009. The 2010 income reflects the increase in values across the
	portfolio.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	increased $5.8 million to $12.7 million in 2010 from
	$6.9 million in 2009. The 2010 distributable earnings
	growth was driven primarily by the $11.7 million increase
	in fee related earnings.

	Fee-earning AUM was $22.2 billion at December 31,
	2011, a decrease of $0.7 billion, or 3%, compared to
	$22.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Inflows of
	$2.3 billion were primarily related to limited partner
	commitments raised by CRP VI, various real estate
	co-investments and our new Realty Credit fund (CRCP I).
	Outflows of $3.1 billion were principally a result of
	(a) the change in basis of our latest Europe real estate
	fund (CEREP III) from commitments to invested capital,
	(b) distributions primarily from our fully invested U.S.
	real estate funds and related co-investments, and (c) the
	decision to no longer collect management fees from our investors
	in our first renewable energy fund (Renew I). Distributions from
	funds still in the investment period do not impact fee-earning
	AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested
	capital. Changes in fair value have no impact on fee-earning AUM
	for Real Assets as substantially all of the funds generate
	management fees based on either commitments or invested capital
	at cost, neither of which is impacted by fair value movements.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $22.9 billion at December 31,
	2010, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 2%, compared to
	$22.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Inflows of
	$1.4 billion were primarily related to limited partner
	commitments raised by CRP VI as well as real estate
	co-investments. Outflows of $0.8 billion were principally a
	result of (a) the change in basis of the predecessor U.S.
	real estate fund (CRP V) from commitments to invested
	capital and (b) distributions from several fully invested
	funds across both real estate and energy.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $22.5 billion at December 31,
	2009, a decrease of $0.3 billion, or 1%, compared to
	$22.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Inflows of
	$0.5 billion were primarily related to equity invested by
	Energy III and one of our renewable energy funds
	(Renew I), both of which are outside of their investment
	period and are therefore based on invested capital, at cost.
	Outflows of $0.8 billion were principally a result of
	(a) the change in basis of one of our Asia real estate
	funds (CAREP I) from commitments to invested capital and
	(b) distributions from some of the fully invested energy

	Total AUM was $30.7 billion at December 31, 2011, a increase of
	$0.1 billion, or less than 1%, compared to $30.6 billion at
	December 31, 2010. This increase was driven by commitments
	raised of $2.1 billion by CRP VI, CRCP I and various real estate
	co-investments and $2.4 billion of market appreciation across
	our portfolio. This appreciation was the result of a 16%
	increase in values across the segment, comprised of a 6%
	increase in values in our real estate funds and a 21% increase
	in values in our energy funds, primarily driven by appreciation
	in the CEREP III and Energy IV portfolios. The increase was
	offset by distributions of $5.5 billion, of which approximately
	$1.4 billion was recycled back into available capital.


	 


	Total AUM was $30.6 billion at December 31, 2010, an
	increase of $2.9 billion, or 10%, compared to
	$27.7 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase was
	primarily driven by $3.2 billion of market appreciation
	across our portfolio due to a 15% increase in values in the
	segment. Our real estate funds appreciated by approximately 4%,
	primarily driven by CRP V and its related RMBS

	co-investments,

	and our energy funds appreciated by 22%, primarily resulting
	from an increase in Energy III and its related
	co-investments and Energy IV. Additionally, we raised new
	commitments of $1.4 billion for CRP VI and various
	coinvestment vehicles. These increases were partially offset by

	distributions of $2.1 billion, of which approximately
	$0.8 billion was recycled back into available capital.


	 


	Total AUM was $27.7 billion at December 31, 2009, an
	increase of $0.4 billion, or 1%, compared to
	$27.3 billion at December 31, 2008. This increase was
	primarily driven by commitments raised of $0.9 billion
	by the latest renewable energy fund (Renew II) and various
	co-investment vehicles and $0.3 billion of market
	appreciation across our portfolio. This appreciation was a
	result of a 3% increase in values in the segment, driven by a
	15% increase in value in our energy funds, offset by a 15%
	decrease in value in our real estate funds. These increases were
	partially offset by distributions of $1.1 billion, of which
	approximately $0.4 billion was recycled back into available
	capital.

	Metrics





	 


	Fund performance information for our investment funds that have
	at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative
	equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2011,
	which we refer to as our significant funds, is
	included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate
	an understanding of our results of operations for the periods
	presented. The fund return information reflected in this
	discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. and is also not necessarily indicative of
	the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in

	(1)






	The data presented herein that
	provides inception to date performance results of
	our segments relates to the period following the formation of
	the first fund within each segment. For our Real Assets segment,
	our first fund was formed in 1997.

	(2)






	Represents the original cost of all
	capital called for investments since inception of the fund.





	 





	(3)






	Represents all realized proceeds
	combined with remaining fair value, before management fees,
	expenses and carried interest. Please see Note 4 to the
	combined and consolidated financial statements for the years
	ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011
	appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for further information
	regarding managements determination of fair value.





	 





	(4)






	Multiple of invested capital
	(MOIC) represents total fair value, before
	management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by
	cumulative invested capital.





	 





	(5)






	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital represents at least
	85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully
	realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves
	pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC, when considered
	together with the other investment performance metrics
	presented, provides investors with meaningful information
	regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of
	investments where significant realization activity has not yet
	occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC have limitations as
	measures of investment performance, and should not be considered
	in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these
	measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and
	other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided
	above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive
	impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC in instances when the
	MOIC in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate
	MOIC. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC may
	not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly
	titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized
	performance information separately for funds that are still in
	the investment period because of the relatively insignificant
	level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the
	extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in
	the Realized/Partially Realized performance information
	presented for Total Real Assets.





	 





	(6)






	Fully Invested funds are past the
	expiration date of the investment period as defined in the
	respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a
	successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor
	fund is categorized as fully invested.





	 





	(7)






	Includes the following funds:
	CRP I, CRP II, CAREP I, ENERGY I and RENEW I.





	 





	(8)






	Includes Co-Investments, prefund
	investments and certain other stand-alone investments arranged
	by us.





	 





	(9)






	Includes the following fund: CAREP
	II.

	The data presented herein that
	provides inception to date performance results of
	our segments relates to the period following the formation of
	the first fund within each segment. For our Real Assets segment,
	our first fund was formed in 1997.

	Gross Internal Rate of Return
	(IRR) represents the annualized IRR for the period
	indicated on limited partner invested capital based on
	contributions, distributions and unrealized value before
	management fees, expenses and carried interest.






	(3)






	Net IRR represents the annualized
	IRR for the period indicated on limited partner invested capital
	based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after
	management fees, expenses and carried interest.






	(4)






	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at
	least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet
	fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy
	involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR, when considered
	together with the other investment performance metrics
	presented, provides investors with meaningful information
	regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of
	investments where significant realization activity has not yet
	occurred. Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR have limitations
	as measures of investment performance, and should not be
	considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that
	these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage
	and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided
	above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive
	impact on Realized/Partially Realized Gross IRR in instances
	when the Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than
	the aggregate Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially
	Realized Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other
	companies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present
	Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately
	for funds that are still in the investment period because of the
	relatively insignificant level of realizations for funds of this
	type. However, to the extent such funds have had realizations,
	they are included in the Realized/Partially Realized performance
	information presented for Total Real Assets.

	Fully invested funds are past the
	expiration date of the investment period as defined in the
	respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a
	successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor
	fund is categorized as fully invested.

	Year
	Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2010





	 


	Total fee revenues were $176.5 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011, an increase of $92.2 million from
	2010. The increase was due to the acquisitions of Claren Road,
	ESG, and CLO contracts from Stanfield and Mizuho. The
	weighted-average management fee rate on our hedge funds remained
	the same during the year while our weighted-average fee rate on
	our carry funds decreased from 1.65% to 1.40% during the year
	due to the rate step-down by one of our distressed and corporate
	opportunities funds (CSP II), which occurred when CSP II reached
	the end of its investment period. This decrease in rates will
	decrease our management fees from these funds in future periods.

	Interest and other income was $4.0 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $2.7 million in
	2010.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits was $101.9 million and
	$114.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, respectively. Performance fee related compensation
	expense was $40.2 million and $74.8 million, or 36%
	and 52% of performance fees, for the years ended
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in
	the percentage is due primarily to the addition of Claren Road
	and ESG in 2011. Since we include only our 55% economic interest
	in Claren Road and ESG in our segment results, most of the
	performance fees associated with those funds do not have
	corresponding performance fee compensation.


	 


	Direct base compensation increased $21.6 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, which
	primarily relates to the acquisitions of Claren Road and ESG and
	the hiring of other professionals in the Global Market
	Strategies business. General, administrative and other indirect
	compensation increased $18.9 million to $51.0 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010,
	also reflecting the acquisitions of Claren Road and ESG, as well
	as increased allocated overhead costs related to our continued
	investment in infrastructure and back office support.


	 


	Interest expense increased $7.9 million, or 304%, for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This
	increase was primarily attributable to interest expense recorded
	for the year ended December 31, 2011 on our subordinated
	notes payable to Mubadala, which we issued in December 2010. In
	October 2011 and March 2012, we used borrowings on the
	revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit
	facility to redeem the $500 million aggregate principal
	amount of the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala. As of
	March 2012, the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala have
	been fully redeemed. The increase was also due to higher
	borrowings under our refinanced term loan and our revolving
	credit facility and indebtedness incurred in connection with the
	acquisition of Claren Road.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$161.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011,
	an increase of $57.5 million from $104.0 million in
	2010. The improvement in ENI for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven
	by an increase in investment income of $11.4 million and
	fee related earnings of $45.1 million, primarily due to the
	acquisition of Claren Road and ESG and CLO contracts from
	Stanfield and Mizuho.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	increased $45.1 million to $57.3 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase
	was primarily due to increases in fee revenues of
	$92.2 million, offset by increases in direct base
	compensation of $21.6 million and general, administrative
	and other indirect compensation of $18.9 million.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees of
	$111.3 million and $144.9 million are inclusive of
	performance fees reversed of approximately $0.7 million and
	$0 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
	respectively. Performance fees for this segment by type of fund
	are as follows:

	Performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 were
	generated primarily by the hedge funds, including $36.2 million
	of performance fees from the Claren Road Master Fund.
	Performance fees in the year ended December 31, 2010 were
	generated primarily by the distressed debt funds, including
	$83.9 million of performance fees from CSP II.

	Net performance fees increased $1.0 million to
	$71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
	compared to $70.1 million in 2010.


	 



	Investment Income.

	  Investment income was
	$33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
	compared to $21.7 million in 2010. The increase in
	investment income during 2011 reflects the increase in values
	across the portfolio.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	increased $170.8 million to $193.4 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2011 from $22.6 million in
	2010. The increase related primarily to increases in realized
	net performance fees of $110.2 million and fee related earnings
	of $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
	as compared to 2010.


	 





	Year
	Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended
	December 31, 2009





	 


	Total fee revenues were $84.3 million in 2010, representing
	a 20% increase over 2009. Approximately $13.1 million of
	the $13.9 million increase was driven by an increase in
	fund management fees with portfolio advisory fees making up the
	balance of the increase. Of the $13.1 million increase in
	fund management fees approximately $10.4 million was due to
	the resumption of subordinated fees on our CLOs and the balance
	is a result of the acquisition of CLO management contracts from
	Stanfield and Mizuho in August and November 2010. The
	weighted-average management fee rate on our carry funds remained
	consistent over the period. The increase in portfolio advisory
	fees was largely from portfolio companies in our distressed
	business.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits was $114.9 million and $40.0
	million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Performance fee related
	compensation expense was $74.8 million and
	$1.2 million, or 52% and 39% of performance fees, in 2010
	and 2009, respectively. The change in the percentage during the
	period is due primarily to different funds generating the
	performance fees in these periods.


	 


	Direct base compensation expense increased $1.3 million in
	2010 compared to 2009, reflecting costs of the new management
	team we brought on board to manage this business. General,
	administrative and other indirect compensation of
	$32.1 million in 2010 was relatively consistent with 2009.


	 


	Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 37%, over the
	comparable period in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to
	lower outstanding borrowings during most of 2010 until we
	refinanced our term loan in November 2010 and borrowed
	$494 million of subordinated debt in December 2010.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$104.0 million in 2010, a substantial improvement from
	$(1.0) million recognized in 2009. The improvement in ENI
	reflected the return and stabilization in the credit markets
	from the credit crisis.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	increased $15.1 million in 2010 from $(2.9) million in
	2009 to a total of $12.2 million.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees were
	$144.9 million and $3.1 million in 2010 and 2009,
	respectively. There were no reversals of performance fees within
	this segment for 2010 and 2009. Performance fees for this
	segment by type of fund are as follows:

	Investments in our distressed debt funds appreciated in excess
	of 40% during 2010 which drove our performance fees in 2010,
	with CSP I and CSP II together generating $110.8 million of
	performance fees in 2010.




	151








	 






	Net performance fees increased $68.2 million to
	$70.1 million in 2010, representing 48% of performance fees.


	 



	Investment Income (Loss).

	  Investment income
	was $21.7 million in 2010 compared to $0.0 million in
	2009. The 2010 income reflects the increase in values across the
	portfolio.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	increased $23.9 million to $22.6 million in 2010 from
	$(1.3) million in 2009. The increase in distributable
	earnings was driven by the $15.1 million increase in fee
	related earnings, $4.2 million increase in realized net
	performance fees and a $4.6 million increase in realized
	investment income.

	Fee-earning AUM was $23.2 billion at December 31,
	2011, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 22%, compared to
	$19.0 billion at December 31, 2010. This increase was
	primarily a result of the acquisitions of a 55% interest in ESG,
	the Foothill CLO, and the Churchill CLO (for further discussion
	of these acquisitions, please refer to  Recent
	Transactions), resulting in additional fee-earning AUM of
	$3.2 billion. Outflows of $0.4 billion were primarily
	driven by the change in basis of the CSP II fund from
	commitments to invested capital. Distributions from carry funds
	still in the investment period do not impact fee-earning AUM as
	these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.
	Additionally, we had subscriptions, net of redemptions, of
	$1.2 billion in our hedge funds and the aggregate par value
	of our CLO collateral balances decreased $0.6 billion.
	Market appreciation of $0.4 billion was primarily due to
	increases in the value of our hedge funds, which charge fees
	based on net asset value.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $19.0 billion at December 31,
	2010, an increase of $6.5 billion, or 52%, compared to
	$12.5 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase was
	primarily a result of acquisitions during the period, totaling
	$9.6 billion, of the Mizuho and Stanfield CLO management
	contracts as well as a 55% interest in Claren Road. The increase
	was partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 billion in the
	par value of our CLO collateral balances.


	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $12.5 billion at December 31,
	2009, a decrease of $0.9 billion, or 7%, compared to
	$13.4 billion at December 31, 2008. This decrease was
	primarily a result of a $1.1 billion decrease in the
	aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances.


	 





	Total
	AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended
	December 31, 2011.

	Total AUM was $24.5 billion at December 31, 2011, an
	increase of $3.9 billion, or 19%, compared to
	$20.6 billion at December 31, 2010. This increase was
	driven by (a) the $3.4 billion acquisitions of a 55%
	interest in ESG, the Foothill CLO, and the Churchill CLO (for
	further discussion of these acquisitions, please refer to
	 Recent Transactions) and
	(b) subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds
	of $1.3 billion and new fund commitments to our energy
	mezzanine fund (CEMOF I) and our latest distressed and
	corporate opportunities fund (CSP III) of
	$0.4 billion. In addition, our Global Market Strategies
	funds appreciated by $0.6 billion, mostly due to
	appreciation in our hedge funds. These increases were partially
	offset by distributions of $1.3 billion from our carry
	funds, of which approximately $0.7 billion was recycled
	back into available capital.


	 


	Total AUM was $20.6 billion at December 31, 2010, an
	increase of $7.3 billion, or 55%, compared to
	$13.3 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase was
	primarily driven by acquisitions during the period, totaling
	$10.5 billion, of the Mizuho and Stanfield CLO management
	contracts and as well a 55% interest in Claren Road. This
	increase was partially offset by (a) distributions of
	$1.0 billion, of which approximately $0.6 billion was
	recycled back into available capital, and (b) a net
	decrease of $3.1 billion in the par value of our CLO
	collateral balances.


	 


	Total AUM was $13.3 billion at December 31, 2009, a
	decrease of $0.6 billion, or 4%, compared to
	$13.9 billion at December 31, 2008. This decrease was
	driven by a net decrease of $1.2 billion in the par value
	of our CLO collateral balances, and was partially offset by
	$0.6 billion of market appreciation resulting primarily
	from increased values in our distressed and corporate
	opportunities funds.

	60% equity interest in, and began to consolidate, AlpInvest. Our
	segment results reflect only our 60% interest in
	AlpInvests operations whereas our combined and
	consolidated financial statements reflect 100% of
	AlpInvests operations and a non-controlling interest of

	For

	2011





	 


	Total fee revenues were $35.0 million for the period from
	July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Management
	fees from our fund of funds vehicles generally range from 0.3%
	to 1.0% on the fund or vehicles capital commitments during
	the first two to five years of the investment period





	156








	 






	and 0.3% to 1.0% on the lower of cost of the capital invested or
	fair value of the capital invested thereafter.


	 


	Total compensation and benefits were $5.0 million for the
	period from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.
	Performance fee related compensation expense was
	$(9.3) million, or 101% of performance fees, for the period
	from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.


	 


	General, administrative and other indirect compensation was
	$7.5 million for the period from July 1, 2011 through
	December 31, 2011. Such expenses are comprised primarily of
	professional fees and rent.


	 



	Economic Net Income.

	  ENI was
	$13.6 million for the period from July 1, 2011 through
	December 31, 2011. The ENI for the period was driven
	primarily by $13.5 million in fee related earnings and
	$0.1 million in net performance fees.


	 



	Fee Related Earnings.

	  Fee related earnings
	were $13.5 million for the period from July 1, 2011
	through December 31, 2011. Fee related earnings were driven
	primarily by $35.0 million in fund management fees during
	the period, offset by $14.3 million in direct base
	compensation and $7.5 million in general, administrative
	and other indirect compensation.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees were
	$(9.2) million for the period from July 1, 2011
	through December 31, 2011. Under our arrangements with the
	historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, such persons
	are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical
	investments and commitments to the fund of funds vehicles that
	existed as of December 31, 2010, 85% of the carried
	interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of
	AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 60% of the
	carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including
	all future commitments from third parties). Net performance fees
	were $0.1 million for the period from July 1, 2011
	through December 31, 2011.


	 



	Distributable Earnings.

	  Distributable earnings
	were $20.2 million for the period from July 1, 2011
	through December 31, 2011. This reflects fee related
	earnings of $13.5 million and realized net performance fees
	of $6.7 million during the period.

	are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.





	 


	Fee-earning AUM was $27.7 billion at December 31,
	2011, a decrease of $3.3 billion, or less than 11%,
	compared to $31.0 billion at July 1, 2011. Inflows of
	$2.5 billion were primarily related to new fund investment
	mandates activated as well as capital called on the fully
	committed funds. Outflows of $2.4 billion were principally
	a result of distributions from several funds outside of their
	commitment period. Distributions from funds still in the
	commitment period do not impact fee-earning AUM as these funds
	are based on commitments and not invested capital. Changes in
	fair value have a slight impact on fee-earning AUM for Fund of
	Funds Solutions as fully committed funds are based on the lower
	of cost or fair value of the underlying investments. However,
	all funds still in their commitment period charge management
	fees on commitments, which are not impacted by fair value
	movements. Additionally, foreign exchange translation losses of
	$3.4 billion are related primarily to the decrease in the
	value of the Euro to the US Dollar.

	Represents the impact of foreign
	exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S.
	dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is
	translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances

	Total AUM was $40.7 billion at December 31, 2011, a
	decrease of $4.2 billion, or 9%, compared to
	$44.9 billion at July 1, 2011. This decrease was
	primarily driven by $3.2 billion of distributions, net of
	amounts recycled, and a $2.1 billion foreign exchange
	translation adjustment. Additionally, we activated new mandates
	of $1.3 billion for our fund investments and co-investments.

	Performance Metrics





	 


	Fund performance information for our investment funds that have
	at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity
	invested or total value as of December 31, 2011, which we
	refer to as our significant funds is included
	throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an
	understanding of our results of operations for the periods
	presented. The fund return information reflected in this
	discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of
	The Carlyle Group L.P. and is also not necessarily indicative of
	the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in
	The Carlyle Group L.P. is not an investment in any of our funds.
	There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other
	existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See
	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business
	OperationsThe historical returns attributable to our
	funds, including those presented in this prospectus, should not
	be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds
	or of our future results or of any returns expected on an
	investment in our common units.

	funds in our Fund of Funds business.

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 


	We require limited capital resources to support the working
	capital and operating needs of our business. Historically, our
	management fees have largely covered our operating costs and we
	have distributed all realized performance fees after related
	compensation to senior Carlyle professionals. Historically,
	approximately 95% of all capital commitments to our funds have
	been provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount
	typically funded by our senior Carlyle professionals and
	employees. Upon the completion of the offering, we intend to
	have Carlyle commit to fund approximately 2% of the capital
	commitments to our future carry funds. In addition, we may, from
	time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional
	interests in our investment funds that become available in the
	ordinary course of their operations. We expect our senior
	Carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make
	significant capital contributions to our funds based on their
	existing commitments, and





	160








	 






	to make capital commitments to future funds consistent with the
	level of their historical commitments. We also intend to make
	investments in our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles.


	 


	Proceeds from our existing indebtedness have been used to:
	(1) finance our global expansion and acquisitions,
	(2) cover losses incurred in connection with the
	liquidation of CCC, (3) fund the capital investments of
	Carlyle in our funds, (4) make distributions to senior
	Carlyle professionals and (5) finance short term loans to
	our funds. While our funds generally will use their own credit
	facilities to bridge capital calls from our limited partner
	investors, we have on occasion made such loans to seed
	investments for new or first-time funds that do not yet have
	their own credit facilities or to bridge the raising of external
	co-investment. In addition, we have funded working capital on
	behalf of our funds and portfolio companies.

	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

	  Net
	cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our
	earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for non-cash
	performance fees and related non-cash compensation that are
	included in earnings. Cash flows from operating activities do
	not reflect any amounts paid or distributed to senior Carlyle
	professionals as these amounts are included as a use of cash for
	distributions in financing activities. As a public company, we
	will record cash compensation expense to senior Carlyle
	professionals which will have the effect of reducing cash
	provided by operating activities and cash used in financing
	activities. Cash used to purchase investments as well as the
	proceeds from the sale of such investments are also reflected in
	our operating activities as investments are a normal part of our
	operating activities. Over time investment proceeds may be
	greater than investment purchases. During the year ended
	December 31, 2011, proceeds were $300.9 million while
	purchases were $135.1 million. However, in the year ended
	December 31, 2010, investment proceeds were
	$41.9 million as compared to purchases of
	$114.8 million. Also included in our net cash provided by
	operating activities are proceeds from sales of investments by
	the Consolidated Funds, offset by purchases of investments by
	the Consolidated Funds. For the year ended December 31,
	2011, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by
	the Consolidated Funds were $7,970.8 million, while
	purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were
	$6,818.9 million. For the year ended December 31,
	2010, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by
	the Consolidated Funds were $5,432.6 million, while
	purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were
	$3,254.3 million. Cash flows associated with the
	Consolidated Funds were not significant in 2009.


	 



	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

	  Our
	investing activities generally reflect cash used for
	acquisitions, fixed assets and software for internal use and
	investments in restricted cash and securities. The acquisitions
	of AlpInvest, ESG, and other CLO management contracts resulted
	in the net use of cash of $62.0 million during 2011. The
	acquisitions of Claren Road and the CLO management contracts
	from Stanfield and Mizuho resulted in the net use of cash of
	$164.1 million during 2010. Purchases of fixed assets were
	$34.2 million, $21.2 million and $27.5 million
	for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
	respectively.




	161








	 







	Net Cash Used in Financing
	Activities.

	  Financing activities are a net use of
	cash in each of the historical periods presented. As noted
	above, financing activities include distributions to senior
	Carlyle professionals of $1,498.4 million,
	$787.8 million and $215.6 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During
	2011, our net borrowings under our revolving credit facility
	were $310.8 million and our payments on our loans payable were
	$307.5 million. The net payments on loans payable by our
	Consolidated Funds during 2011 were $1,204.7 million.
	During 2010, our borrowing proceeds from loans payable exceeded
	our principal payment reductions from loans payable by
	$582.1 million, reflecting the $494 million of net
	proceeds from our subordinated notes from Mubadala and from net
	proceeds obtained when we amended and extended the terms of our
	term loan in 2010. The net payments on loans payable by our
	Consolidated Funds during 2010 was $2,280.5 million. Cash
	flows associated with the Consolidated Funds were not
	significant in 2009.


	 




	Our
	Sources of Cash and Liquidity Needs




	 


	In the future, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will
	be to:


	 












	 


	 


	provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing
	business lines;




	 




	 


	 


	provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new,
	complementary business lines, including acquisitions;




	 




	 


	 


	pay operating expenses, including compensation and other
	obligations as they arise;




	 




	 


	 


	fund capital expenditures;




	 




	 


	 


	repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses;




	 




	 


	 


	pay income taxes;




	 




	 


	 


	make distributions to Carlyle Holdings unit holders; and




	 




	 


	 


	fund the capital investments of Carlyle in our funds.




	 


	We generally use our working capital and cash flows to invest in
	growth initiatives, service our debt, fund the working capital
	needs of our investment funds and pay distributions to our
	equity owners. We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our
	capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows,
	accumulated earnings and funds from our existing senior secured
	credit facility, including a term loan facility and a revolving
	credit facility with $424.8 million available as of
	December 31, 2011 (inclusive of $14.3 million of
	availability set aside to cover our guarantee of our

	co-investment

	loan program), and we believe these sources will be sufficient
	to fund our capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
	On September 30, 2011, we amended the terms of our existing
	senior secured credit facility to increase the revolving credit
	facility from $150.0 million to $750.0 million. On
	December 13, 2011, we entered into a new senior credit
	facility. The new senior credit facility, while currently
	effective, will not become operative unless and until certain
	conditions are satisfied, including the consummation of this
	Offering and the repayment of borrowings under the revolving
	credit facility of the existing senior secured credit facility
	used to finance distributions, if any, to our existing owners.
	On March 1, 2012, we borrowed $263.1 million under the
	revolving credit facility to redeem all of the remaining
	$250.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of
	the subordinated notes held by Mubadala for a redemption price
	of $260.0 million, representing a 4% premium, plus accrued
	interest of approximately $3.1 million. We are not
	dependent upon the proceeds from this offering to meet our
	liquidity needs for the next 12 months. After completion of
	this offering, we intend to pay distributions from cash flow
	from operations, and, as needed, from draws on available
	borrowings from our revolving credit facility or sales of assets.

	Since our inception through December 31, 2011, we and our
	senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other
	professionals have invested or committed to invest in excess of
	$4 billion in or alongside our funds. The current invested
	capital and unfunded commitment of Carlyle and our senior
	Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other
	professionals to our investment funds as of December 31,

	A substantial majority of these investments have been funded by,
	and a substantial majority of the remaining commitments are
	expected to be funded by, senior Carlyle professionals,
	operating executives and other professionals through our
	internal co-investment program.


	 


	Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs
	is the realized carried interest and incentive fee revenue
	generated by our investment funds. Carried interest is realized
	when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the
	funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred
	return. Incentive fees earned on hedge fund structures are
	realized at the end of each funds measurement period.
	Incentive fees earned on our CLO vehicles are paid upon the
	dissolution of such vehicles.

	Our
	Balance Sheet and Indebtedness




	 


	Total assets were $24.7 billion at December 31, 2011,
	an increase of $7.6 billion from December 31, 2010.
	The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to the
	acquisitions of AlpInvest and ESG during 2011 and the related
	consolidation of certain AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles and
	ESG hedge funds. Assets of Consolidated Funds were approximately
	$20.5 billion at December 31, 2011 representing an
	increase of $7.5 billion over December 31, 2010. Total
	liabilities were $13.6 billion at December 31, 2011, a
	decrease of $0.6 billion from December 31, 2010. The
	assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally
	held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the assets
	of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our
	liquidity requirements and similarly the liabilities of the
	Consolidated Funds are

	non-recourse

	to us.


	 


	Our balance sheet without the effect of the Consolidated Funds
	can be seen in Note 16 to our combined and consolidated
	financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. At
	December 31, 2011, our total assets were $4.3 billion,
	including cash and cash equivalents of $0.5 billion and
	investments of approximately $2.7 billion. Investments
	include accrued performance





	163








	 






	fees of approximately $2.1 billion at December 31,
	2011 which is the amount of carried interest that we would have
	received had we sold all of our funds investments at their
	reported fair values at that date.


	 



	Loans Payable.

	  Loans payable on our balance
	sheet at December 31, 2011 reflects $810.9 million
	outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, comprised
	of $500.0 million of term loan outstanding and
	$310.9 million outstanding under the revolving credit
	facility, and $50.0 million of Claren Road
	acquisition-related indebtedness.


	 



	Senior Secured Credit Facility.

	  In 2007, we
	entered into an $875.0 million senior secured credit
	facility with financial institutions under which we could borrow
	up to $725.0 million in a term loan and $150.0 million
	in a revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the bankruptcy of
	one of the financial institutions that was a party to the credit
	facility, the borrowing availability under the revolving credit
	facility was effectively reduced to $115.7 million. Both
	the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were
	scheduled to mature on August 20, 2013.


	 


	In November 2010, we modified the senior secured credit facility
	and repaid the $370.3 million outstanding principal amount.
	The amended facility includes $500.0 million in a term loan
	and $150.0 million in a revolving credit facility. On
	September 30, 2011, the senior secured credit facility was
	amended and extended to increase the revolving credit facility
	to $750.0 million. The amended term loan and revolving
	credit facility will mature on September 30, 2016.
	Principal amounts outstanding under the amended term loan and
	revolving credit facility will accrue interest, at the option of
	the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an
	applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus an
	applicable margin not to exceed 1.75% (2.05% and 2.51% at
	December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010,
	respectively). Outstanding principal amounts due under the term
	loan are payable quarterly beginning in September 2014 as
	follows: $75 million in 2014, $175 million in 2015 and
	$250 million in 2016. See  Contractual
	Obligations for additional information.


	 


	We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our
	variable rate debt financing. To manage this risk, we entered
	into an interest rate swap in March 2008 to fix the interest
	rate on approximately 33% of the $725.0 million in term
	loan borrowings at 5.069%. The interest rate swap had an initial
	notional balance of $239.2 million, a current balance of
	$149.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and amortizes
	through August 20, 2013 (the swaps maturity date) as
	the related term loan borrowings are repaid. This instrument was
	designated as a cash flow hedge and remains in place after the
	amendment of the senior secured credit facility.


	 


	In December 2011, we entered into a second interest rate swap
	with an initial notional balance of $350.5 million to fix
	the interest rate at 2.832% on the remaining term loan
	borrowings not hedged by the March 2008 interest rate swap. This
	interest rate swap matures on September 30, 2016, which
	coincides with the maturity of the term loan. This instrument
	has been designated as a cash flow hedge.


	 


	The senior secured credit facility is secured by equity
	interests in certain entities that are entitled to receive
	management fees and carried interest allocable to our senior
	Carlyle professionals from certain funds and requires us to
	comply with certain financial and other covenants, which include
	maintaining management fee earning assets (as defined in the
	amended agreement) of at least $50.1 billion, a senior debt
	leverage ratio of less than or equal to 2.5 to 1.0, a total debt
	leverage ratio of less than 5.5 to 1.0 (or 5.0 to 1.0 from and
	after December 2013), and a minimum interest coverage ratio of
	not less than 4.0 to 1.0, in each case, tested on a quarterly
	basis. The senior secured credit facility also contains
	nonfinancial covenants that restrict some of our corporate
	activities, including our ability to incur additional debt, pay
	certain dividends, create liens, make certain acquisitions or
	investments and engage in specified transactions with
	affiliates. Non compliance with any of the financial or
	nonfinancial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute
	an event of default under the senior secured credit facility. An
	event of default resulting from a breach of a financial or
	nonfinancial covenant may result, at the option of the lenders,
	in an acceleration of the principal and





	164








	 






	interest outstanding, and a termination of the revolving credit
	facility. The senior secured credit facility also contains other
	customary events of default, including defaults based on events
	of bankruptcy and insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest
	or fees when due, breach of specified covenants, change in
	control and material inaccuracy of representations and
	warranties. We were in compliance with the financial and
	non-financial covenants of the senior secured credit facility as
	of December 31, 2011.


	 


	On October 20, 2011, we borrowed $265.5 million under
	the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured
	credit facility to redeem $250 million aggregate principal
	amount of the subordinated notes held by Mubadala for a
	redemption price of $260.0 million, representing a 4%
	premium, plus accrued interest of approximately
	$5.5 million. On March 1, 2012, we borrowed $263.1
	million under the revolving credit facility to redeem all of the
	remaining $250.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount
	of the subordinated notes held by Mubadala for a redemption
	price of $260.0 million, representing a 4% premium, plus accrued
	interest of approximately $3.1 million. The redemptions are
	expected to reduce our debt service costs and eliminate the
	dilution to equity holders that would have otherwise resulted
	upon conversion of the notes. Interest on the amounts borrowed
	under the revolving credit facility (assuming LIBOR rates as of
	December 31, 2011) would be approximately
	$6 million less on a quarterly basis than interest on the
	redeemed subordinated notes.


	 


	On December 13, 2011, we entered into a new senior credit
	facility. The new senior credit facility, while currently
	effective, will not become operative unless and until certain
	conditions are satisfied, including the consummation of this
	offering, the redemption, repurchase or conversion of the
	subordinated notes issued to Mubadala, and the repayment of
	borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the existing
	senior secured credit facility used to finance distributions, if
	any, to our existing owners. If and when the new senior credit
	facility becomes operative, it will replace our existing senior
	secured credit facility, amounts borrowed under the existing
	senior secured credit facility will be deemed to have been
	repaid by borrowings in like amount under the new senior credit
	facility, and we will no longer be subject to the financial and
	other covenants of the existing senior secured credit facility
	(except to the extent such covenants are contained in the new
	senior credit facility).


	 


	The new senior credit facility will include $500.0 million in a
	term loan and $750.0 million in a revolving credit facility. The
	new term loan and revolving credit facility will mature on
	September 30, 2016. Principal amounts outstanding under the new
	term loan and revolving credit facility will accrue interest, at
	the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base
	rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at
	LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.75%.
	Outstanding principal amounts due under the term loan are
	payable quarterly beginning in September 2014 as follows: $75
	million in 2014, $175 million in 2015 and $250 million in 2016.
	The new senior credit facility will be unsecured and will not be
	guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Parent Entities (unless we
	so elect). We will be required to maintain management fee
	earning assets (as defined in the new senior credit facility) of
	at least $50.1 billion and a total debt leverage ratio of
	not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. We will be permitted to incur
	secured indebtedness in an amount not greater than
	$125 million, subject to certain other permitted liens. We
	will not be subject to a senior debt leverage ratio or a minimum
	interest coverage ratio.


	 



	Claren Road Loans.

	  As part of the Claren Road
	acquisition, we entered into a loan agreement for
	$47.5 million. The loan matures on December 31, 2015
	and interest is payable semi-annually, commencing June 30,
	2011 at an adjustable annual rate, currently 6.0%. At
	December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal amount of this
	loan was $40.0 million. Also in connection with the Claren Road
	acquisition, Claren Road entered into a loan agreement with a
	financial institution for $50.0 million. The loan matures
	on January 3, 2017 and interest is payable quarterly,
	commencing March 31, 2011 at an annual rate of 8.0%. At
	December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal amount of this
	loan was $10.0 million, which was subsequently repaid in 2012.
	We include the indebtedness of





	165








	 






	Claren Road on our combined and consolidated balance sheets due
	to our 55% ownership of and control over Claren Road.


	 



	Subordinated Notes Payable to Mubadala.

	  In
	December 2010, we received net cash proceeds of
	$494.0 million from Mubadala in exchange for
	$500.0 million in subordinated notes, equity interests in
	Carlyle and certain additional rights. On October 20, 2011,
	we borrowed $265.5 million under our revolving credit
	facility to redeem $250.0 million aggregate principal
	amount of the subordinated notes for a redemption price of
	$260.0 million, representing a 4% premium, plus accrued
	interest of approximately $5.5 million. On March 1,
	2012, we borrowed an additional $263.1 million under the
	revolving credit facility to redeem all of the remaining
	$250.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes for a
	redemption price of $260.0 million, representing a 4%
	premium, plus accrued interest of approximately
	$3.1 million.


	 


	Interest on the subordinated notes was payable semi-annually,
	commencing June 30, 2011 at an annual rate of 7.25% per
	annum to the extent paid in cash or 7.5% per annum to the extent
	paid by issuing

	payment-in-kind

	notes (PIK Notes). Interest payable on the first
	interest payment date was payable in cash. We elected to pay all
	interest payable on these notes entirely in cash. We elected the
	fair value option to measure the subordinated notes at fair
	value. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the
	fair value of the subordinated notes is $262.5 million and
	$494.0 million, respectively. The primary reasons for
	electing the fair value option are to (i) reflect economic
	events in earnings on a timely basis and (ii) address
	simplification and cost-benefit considerations. Changes in the
	fair value of this instrument of $28.5 million for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 were recognized in earnings and
	included in other non-operating expenses in the combined and
	consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this
	prospectus.


	 



	Obligations of CLOs.

	  Loans payable of the
	Consolidated Funds represent amounts due to holders of debt
	securities issued by the CLOs. We are not liable for any loans
	payable of the CLOs. Several of the CLOs issued preferred shares
	representing the most subordinated interest, however these
	tranches are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity dates of
	the senior secured loans payable, and as a result have been
	classified as liabilities under U.S. GAAP, and are included
	in loans payable of Consolidated Funds in our combined and
	consolidated balance sheets.


	 


	As of December 31, 2011, the following borrowings were
	outstanding at our CLOs, including preferred shares classified
	as liabilities.

	The subordinated notes, income
	notes and preferred shares do not have contractual interest
	rates, but instead receive distributions from the excess cash
	flows of the CLOs.





	 





	(2)






	The combination notes do not have
	contractual interest rates and have recourse only to U.S.
	Treasury securities and OATS specifically held to collateralize
	such combination notes.





	 


	The fair value of senior secured notes, subordinated notes,
	income notes and preferred shares, and combination notes of our
	CLOs as of December 31, 2011 was $9.0 billion,
	$670.7 million, and $8.5 million, respectively.


	 


	Loans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held
	by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy
	the liabilities of another. This collateral consists of cash and
	cash





	166








	 






	equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other
	securities. Included in loans payable of the CLOs are loan
	revolvers (the APEX Revolvers) which the CLOs
	entered into with financial institutions on their respective
	closing dates. The APEX Revolvers provide credit enhancement to
	the securities issued by the CLOs by allowing the CLOs to draw
	down on the revolvers in order to offset a certain level of
	principal losses upon any default of the investment assets held
	by that CLO. The APEX Revolvers allow for a maximum borrowing of
	$38.3 million as of December 31, 2011 and bear
	weighted interest at LIBOR plus 0.37% per annum. Amounts
	borrowed under the APEX Revolvers are repaid based on cash flows
	available subject to priority of payments under each CLOs
	governing documents. There were no outstanding principal amounts
	borrowed under the APEX Revolvers as of December 31, 2011.


	 


	In addition, certain CLOs entered into liquidity facility
	agreements with various liquidity facility providers on or about
	the various closing dates in order to fund payments of interest
	when there are insufficient funds available. The proceeds from
	such draw-downs are available for payments of interest at each
	interest payment date and the acquisition or exercise of an
	option or warrant comprised in any collateral enhancement
	obligation. The liquidity facilities, in aggregate, allow for a
	maximum borrowing of $12.9 million and bear weighted
	average interest at EURIBOR plus 0.25% per annum. Amounts
	borrowed under the liquidity facilities are repaid based on cash
	flows available subject to priority of payments under each
	CLOs governing documents. There were no borrowings
	outstanding under this liquidity facility as of
	December 31, 2011.


	 





	Unconsolidated
	Entities





	 


	Our Corporate Private Equity funds have not historically
	utilized substantial leverage at the fund level other than
	short-term borrowings under certain fund level lines of credit
	which are used to fund liquidity needs in the interim between
	the date of an investment and the receipt of capital from the
	investing funds investors. These funds do, however, make
	direct or indirect investments in companies that utilize
	leverage in their capital structure. The degree of leverage
	employed varies among portfolio companies.


	 


	Certain of our real estate funds have entered into lines of
	credits secured by their investors unpaid capital
	commitments. Due to the relatively large number of investments
	made by these funds, the lines of credit are primarily employed
	to reduce the overall number of capital calls. In certain
	instances, however, they may be used for other investment
	related activities, including serving as bridge financing for
	investments.



	 




	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 


	In the normal course of business, we enter into various
	off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning
	limited or general partner interests in consolidated and

	non-consolidated

	funds, entering into derivative transactions, entering into
	operating leases and entering into guarantee arrangements. We
	also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain
	of our consolidated and non-consolidated funds. We do not have
	any other off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us
	to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in any
	of our other investment funds.


	 


	See Note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further

	(a)






	These obligations exclude the
	$250 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated
	notes payable to Mubadala as of December 31, 2011, as these
	notes were fully redeemed in March 2012 and, if not
	redeemed, would have been converted into additional equity
	interests upon consummation of this offering. These obligations
	assume that no prepayments are made on outstanding loans, except
	for the $10 million outstanding Claren Road loan balance as
	of December 31, 2011, which was prepaid in 2012.





	 





	(b)






	These obligations exclude interest
	on the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala. Borrowings on our
	revolving credit facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%
	per annum (2.05% as of December 31, 2011). The interest
	rate on the term loan, including the impact of the interest rate
	swaps, ranges from 2.83% to 3.50%. Interest payments on
	fixed-rate loans are based on rates ranging from 6.0% to 8.0%.
	Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans
	are held until maturity, except for the interest on the $10
	million outstanding Claren Road loan balance as of December 31,
	2011, which was prepaid in 2012.





	 





	(c)






	These obligations represent our
	probability-weighted estimate of probable amounts to be paid on
	the performance-based contingent consideration obligations
	associated with our business acquisitions. The actual amounts to
	be paid under these agreements will not be determined until the
	specific performance conditions are met. See Note 3 to our
	combined and consolidated financial statements included
	elsewhere in this prospectus.





	 





	(d)






	We lease office space in various
	countries around the world and maintain our headquarters in
	Washington, D.C., where we lease our primary office space
	under a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring on July 31,
	2026. Our office leases in other locations expire in various
	years from 2012 through 2020. The amounts in this table
	represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of
	the lease.





	 





	(e)






	These obligations represent
	commitments by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid
	for each investment made by our funds. These amounts are
	generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less
	than one year category. A substantial majority of these
	investments is expected to be funded by senior Carlyle
	professionals and other professionals through our internal
	co-investment program. Of the remaining $1.4 billion of
	commitments, approximately $1.3 billion is expected to be
	funded individually by senior Carlyle professionals, operating
	executives and other professionals, with the balance funded
	directly by the firm.





	 





	(f)






	These obligations represent amounts
	due to holders of debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO
	vehicles.





	 





	(g)






	These obligations represent
	interest to be paid on debt securities issued by the
	consolidated CLO vehicles. Interest payments assume that no
	prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity. For debt
	securities with rights only to the residual value of the CLO and
	no stated interest, no interest payments were included in this
	calculation. Interest payments on variable-rate debt securities
	are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31,
	2011, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the debt
	agreements, and range from 0.02% to 12.65%.





	 





	(h)






	These obligations represent
	commitments of the CLOs and Consolidated Funds to fund certain
	investments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are
	therefore presented in the less than one year category.







	168








	 






	 













	(i)






	Our consolidated hedge funds are
	subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these
	funds. These obligations represent the amount of redemptions
	where the amount requested in the redemption notice has become
	fixed and payable.





	 





	Guarantees





	 


	In 2001, we entered into an agreement with a financial
	institution pursuant to which we are the guarantor on a credit
	facility for eligible employees investing in Carlyle-sponsored
	funds. This credit facility renews on an annual basis, allowing
	for annual incremental borrowings up to an aggregate of
	$16.1 million, and accrues interest at the lower of the
	prime rate, as defined, or three-month LIBOR plus 2% (3.25% at
	December 31, 2011), reset quarterly. At December 31,
	2011, approximately $14.3 million was outstanding under the
	credit facility and payable by the employees. No material
	funding under the guarantee has been required, and we believe
	the likelihood of any material funding under the guarantee to be
	remote.


	 





	Indemnifications





	 


	In many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the
	third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The
	terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the
	amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be
	determined and has not been included in the table above or
	recorded in our condensed combined and consolidated financial
	statements as of December 31, 2011.


	 





	Tax
	Receivable Agreement





	 


	Holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings (other than The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries), subject to
	the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and
	transfer restrictions applicable to such holders as set forth in
	the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships,
	may on a quarterly basis, from and after the first anniversary
	of the date of the closing of this offering (subject to the
	terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	units on a

	one-for-one

	basis. In addition, subject to certain requirements, CalPERS
	will generally be permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for common units from and after the closing of
	this offering and Mubadala will generally be entitled to
	exchange Carlyle Holdings partnerships units for common units
	following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering.
	Any common units received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such
	exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in
	Common Units Eligible For Future Sale  Lock-Up
	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. The exchanges are expected to result in
	increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets
	of Carlyle Holdings. These increases in tax basis may increase
	(for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and
	therefore reduce the amount of tax that Carlyle Holdings I GP
	Inc. and any other corporate taxpayers would otherwise be
	required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge
	all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could
	sustain such a challenge.


	 


	As described in greater detail under Certain Relationships
	and Related Person Transactions  Tax Receivable
	Agreement, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with
	our existing owners that provides for the payment by the
	corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of 85% of the amount
	of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate
	taxpayers realize as a result of these increases in tax basis
	and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the
	tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to
	payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment
	obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not
	of Carlyle Holdings. While the actual increase in tax basis, as
	well as the amount and timing of any payments under this
	agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors,
	including the timing of exchanges, the price of our common units
	at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges
	are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect
	that as a result of the





	169








	 






	size of the transfers and increases in the tax basis of the
	tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings, the payments
	that we may make to our existing owners will be substantial. The
	payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned
	upon our existing owners continued ownership of us. In the
	event that The Carlyle Group L.P. or any of its wholly-owned
	subsidiaries that are not treated as corporations for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes become taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, these entities will also be
	obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement on
	the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers.


	 


	The tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes
	of control, or if, at any time, the corporate taxpayers elect an
	early termination of the tax receivable agreement, the corporate
	taxpayers obligations under the tax receivable agreement
	(with respect to all Carlyle Holdings partnership units whether
	or not previously exchanged) would be calculated by reference to
	the value of all future payments that our existing owners would
	have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement
	using certain valuation assumptions, including that the
	corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income to
	fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax
	deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering
	into the tax receivable agreement and, in the case of an early
	termination election, that any Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the
	market value of the common units at the time of termination. In
	addition, our existing owners will not reimburse us for any
	payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if
	such tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the IRS.
	The corporate taxpayers ability to achieve benefits from
	any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under this
	agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the
	timing and amount of our future income. As a result, even in the
	absence of a change of control or an election to terminate the
	tax receivable agreement, payments to our existing owners under
	the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate
	taxpayers actual cash tax savings.


	 





	Contingent
	Obligations (Giveback)





	 


	An accrual for potential repayment of previously received
	performance fees of $136.5 million at December 31,
	2011 is shown as accrued giveback obligations on the combined
	and consolidated balance sheet, representing the giveback
	obligation that would need to be paid if the funds were
	liquidated at their current fair values at December 31,
	2011. However, the ultimate giveback obligation, if any, does
	not arise until the end of a funds life. We have recorded
	$56.5 million of unbilled receivables from former and
	current employees and our individual senior Carlyle
	professionals as of December 31, 2011 related to giveback
	obligations, which are included in due from affiliates and other
	receivables, net in our combined and consolidated balance sheet
	as of such date.


	 


	If, as of December 31, 2011, all of the investments held by
	our funds were deemed worthless, the amount of realized and
	distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would
	be $856.7 million, on an after-tax basis where applicable.


	 


	Our senior Carlyle professionals and employees who have received
	carried interest distributions are severally responsible for
	funding their proportionate share of any giveback obligations.
	However, the governing agreements of certain of our funds
	provide that to the extent a current or former employee from
	such funds does not fund his or her respective share, then we
	may have to fund additional amounts beyond what we received in
	carried interest, although we will generally retain the right to
	pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements
	against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their
	obligations.


	 





	Contingencies





	 


	From time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings,
	lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business.
	Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which
	may result in regulatory proceedings against us.


	 


	In September 2006 and March 2009, we received requests for
	certain documents and other information from the Antitrust
	Division of the DOJ in connection with the DOJs
	investigation of alternative asset management firms to determine
	whether they have engaged in conduct prohibited





	170








	 






	by U.S. antitrust laws. We have fully cooperated with the
	DOJs investigation. There can be no assurance as to the
	direction this inquiry may take in the future or whether it will
	have an adverse impact on the private equity industry in some
	unforeseen way.


	 


	On February 14, 2008, a private

	class-action

	lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged
	anti-competitive business practices was filed in the
	U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
	(

	Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of
	Detroit v. Apollo Global Management, LLC

	). The
	complaint alleges, among other things, that certain alternative
	asset management firms, including Carlyle, violated
	Section 1 of the Sherman Act by, among other things,
	forming multi-sponsor consortiums for the purpose of bidding
	collectively in certain going private transactions, which the
	plaintiffs allege constitutes a conspiracy in restraint of
	trade. The plaintiffs seek damages as provided for in
	Section 4 of the Clayton Act and an injunction against such
	conduct in restraint of trade in the future. While Carlyle
	believes the lawsuit is without merit and is contesting it
	vigorously, it is difficult to determine what impact, if any,
	this litigation (and any future related litigation), together
	with any increased governmental scrutiny or regulatory
	initiatives, will have on the private equity industry generally
	or on Carlyle.


	 


	Along with many other companies and individuals in the financial
	sector, Carlyle and one of our funds, CMP I, are named as
	defendants in

	Foy v. Austin Capital,

	a case filed in
	June 2009, pending in the State of New Mexicos First
	Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, which purports to
	be a

	qui tam

	suit on behalf of the State of New Mexico.
	The suit alleges that investment decisions by New Mexico public
	investment funds were improperly influenced by campaign
	contributions and payments to politically connected placement
	agents. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, actual damages,
	actual damages for lost income, rescission of the investment
	transactions described in the complaint and disgorgement of all
	fees received. In May 2011, the Attorney General of New Mexico
	moved to dismiss certain defendants including Carlyle and
	CMP I on the ground that separate civil litigation by the
	Attorney General is a more effective means to seek recovery for
	the State from these defendants. The Attorney General has
	brought two civil actions against certain of those defendants,
	not including the Carlyle defendants. The Attorney General has
	stated that its investigation is continuing and it may bring
	additional civil actions. We are currently unable to anticipate
	when the litigation will conclude, or what impact the litigation
	may have on us.


	 


	In July 2009, a former shareholder of Carlyle Capital
	Corporation Limited (CCC), claiming to have lost
	$20.0 million, filed a claim against CCC, Carlyle and
	certain of our affiliates and one of our officers (

	Huffington
	v. TC Group L.L.C. et al.

	) alleging violations of
	Massachusetts blue sky law provisions and related
	claims involving material misrepresentations and omissions
	allegedly made during and after the marketing of CCC. The
	plaintiff seeks treble damages, interest, expenses and
	attorneys fees and to have the subscription agreement
	deemed null and void and a full refund of the investment. In
	March 2010, the United States District Court for the District of
	Massachusetts dismissed the plaintiffs complaint on the
	grounds that it should have been filed in Delaware instead of
	Massachusetts, and the plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of
	appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
	Circuit. The plaintiff has lost his appeal to the First Circuit
	and has filed a new claim in Delaware state court. The Delaware
	state court granted in part and denied in part defendants
	motion for summary judgment. The defendants are vigorously
	contesting the one remaining claim asserted by the plaintiff.


	 


	In November 2009, another CCC investor instituted legal
	proceedings on similar grounds in Kuwaits Court of First
	Instance (

	National Industries Group v. Carlyle
	Group

	) seeking to recover losses incurred in connection with
	an investment in CCC. In July 2011, the Delaware Court of
	Chancery issued a decision restraining the plaintiff from
	proceeding in Kuwait against either Carlyle Investment
	Management L.L.C. or TC Group, L.L.C., based on the forum
	selection clause in the plaintiffs subscription agreement,
	which provided for exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts. In
	September 2011, the plaintiff reissued its complaint in Kuwait
	naming CCC only, and reissued its complaint in
	January 2012 joining Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C.
	as a defendant. We believe these claims are without merit and
	intend to vigorously contest all such allegations.

	The Guernsey liquidators who took control of CCC in March 2008
	filed four suits in July 2010 against Carlyle, certain of its
	affiliates and the former directors of CCC in the Delaware
	Chancery Court, the Royal Court of Guernsey, the Superior Court
	of the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court of New York,
	New York County, (

	Carlyle Capital Corporation Limited v.
	Conway et al.

	) seeking $1.0 billion in damages. They
	allege that Carlyle and the CCC board of directors were
	negligent, grossly negligent or willfully mismanaged the CCC
	investment program and breached certain fiduciary duties
	allegedly owed to CCC and its shareholders. The Liquidators
	further allege (among other things) that the directors and
	Carlyle put the interests of Carlyle ahead of the interests of
	CCC and its shareholders and gave priority to preserving and
	enhancing Carlyles reputation and its brand
	over the best interests of CCC. The defendants filed a
	comprehensive motion to dismiss in Delaware in October 2010. In
	December 2010, the Liquidators dismissed the complaint in
	Delaware voluntarily and without prejudice and expressed an
	intent to proceed against the defendants in Guernsey. Carlyle
	filed an action in Delaware seeking an injunction against the
	Liquidators to preclude them from proceeding in Guernsey in
	violation of a Delaware exclusive jurisdiction clause contained
	in the investment management agreement. In July 2011, the Royal
	Court of Guernsey held that the case should be litigated in
	Delaware pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. That
	ruling was appealed by the Liquidators, and in February 2012 was
	reversed by the Guernsey Court of Appeal, which held that the
	case should proceed in Guernsey. Carlyle intends to seek review
	of that ruling pursuant to an application for special leave to
	the Privy Council. Carlyle will also request a stay of further
	proceedings, pending consideration of the appeal application,
	from the Privy Council. Also, in October 2011, the plaintiffs
	obtained an

	ex parte

	anti-anti-suit injunction in
	Guernsey against Carlyles anti-suit claim in Delaware.
	That ruling has been affirmed by the Guernsey Court of Appeal.
	Carlyle anticipates that it will seek a further appeal before
	the Privy Council on the anti-anti-suit injunction order. The
	Liquidators lawsuits in New York and the District of
	Columbia were dismissed in December 2011 without prejudice. We
	believe that regardless of where the claims are litigated they
	are without merit and we will vigorously contest all
	allegations. We recognized a loss of $152.3 million in 2008
	in connection with the winding up of CCC.


	 


	In June 2011, August 2011, and September 2011, three putative
	shareholder class actions were filed against Carlyle, certain of
	our affiliates and former directors of CCC alleging that the
	fund offering materials and various public disclosures were
	materially misleading or omitted material information. Two of
	the shareholder class actions, (

	Phelps

	v.

	Stomber, et
	al.

	) and (

	Glaubach

	v.

	Carlyle Capital Corporation
	Limited, et al.

	), were filed in the United States District
	Court for the District of Columbia. The most recent shareholder
	class action (

	Phelps

	v.

	Stomber, et al.

	) was filed
	in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County and has
	subsequently been removed to the United States District Court
	for the Southern District of New York. The two original D.C.
	cases were consolidated into one case, under the caption of

	Phelps v. Stomber,

	and the Phelps named plaintiffs have
	been designated lead plaintiffs by the Court. The
	New York case has been transferred to the D.C. federal court and
	the plaintiffs have requested that it be consolidated with the
	other two D.C. actions. The defendants have opposed and have
	moved to dismiss the case as duplicative. The plaintiffs in all
	three cases seek all compensatory damages sustained as a result
	of the alleged misrepresentations, costs and expenses, as well
	as reasonable attorney fees. The defendants have filed a
	comprehensive motion to dismiss. We believe the claims are
	without merit and will vigorously contest all claims.


	 


	From 2007 to 2009, a Luxembourg portfolio company owned by
	Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners, L.P. (CEREP I)
	received proceeds from the sale of real estate located in Paris,
	France. CEREP I is a real estate fund not consolidated by us.
	The relevant French tax authorities have asserted that such
	portfolio company had a permanent establishment in France, and
	have issued a tax assessment seeking to collect
	97.0 million, consisting of taxes, interest and
	penalties. We understand that the matter has been referred to
	the French Ministry of Justice, which may appoint a prosecutor
	to conduct an investigation.


	 


	During 2006, CEREP I completed a reorganization of several
	Italian portfolio companies. Such Italian portfolio
	companies subsequently completed the sale of various properties
	located in Italy. The Italian tax authorities have issued
	revised income tax audit reports to various subsidiaries of
	CEREP I. The tax audit reports proposed to disallow
	deductions of certain capital losses claimed





	172








	 






	with respect to the reorganization of the Italian portfolio
	companies. As a result of the disallowance of such
	deductions, the audit reports proposed to increase the aggregate
	amount of Italian income tax and penalties owed by subsidiaries
	of CEREP I by approximately 50.0 million. It is
	possible that the Italian Ministry of Justice could appoint a
	prosecutor to conduct an investigation.


	 


	CEREP I and its subsidiaries and portfolio companies are
	contesting the French tax assessment and also intend to contest
	the proposed Italian income tax adjustments. Settlement
	opportunities are also being explored. Although neither
	CEREP I nor the relevant portfolio companies is consolidated by
	us, we may determine to advance amounts to such nonconsolidated
	entities or otherwise incur costs to resolve such matters, in
	which case we would seek to recover such advance from proceeds
	of subsequent portfolio dispositions by CEREP I. The amount of
	any unrecoverable costs that may be incurred by us is not
	estimable at this time.



	 




	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 



	Principles of Consolidation.

	  Our policy is to
	consolidate those entities in which we have control over
	significant operating, financing or investing decisions of the
	entity. All significant inter-entity transactions and balances
	have been eliminated.


	 


	For entities that are determined to be variable interest
	entities (VIEs), we consolidate those entities where
	we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Where VIEs have not
	qualified for the deferral of the revised consolidation guidance
	as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
	statements, an enterprise is determined to be the primary
	beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest. A
	controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power
	to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most
	significantly impacts the entitys economic financial
	performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the
	entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that
	could potentially be significant to the VIE. The revised
	consolidation guidance requires analysis to (a) determine
	whether an entity in which Carlyle holds a variable interest is
	a VIE, and (b) whether Carlyles involvement, through
	holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or
	contractually through other variable interests (e.g., management
	and performance related fees), would give it a controlling
	financial interest. Performance of that analysis requires
	judgment. Our involvement with entities that have been subject
	to the revised consolidation guidance has generally been limited
	to our CLOs and the acquisitions of Claren Road, AlpInvest and
	ESG.


	 


	Where VIEs have qualified for the deferral of the revised
	consolidation guidance, the analysis is based on previously
	existing consolidation guidance pursuant to U.S. GAAP.
	Generally, with the exception of the CLOs, our funds qualify for
	the deferral of the revised consolidation rules under which the
	primary beneficiary is the entity that absorbs a majority of the
	expected losses of the VIE or a majority of the expected
	residual returns of the VIE, or both. We determine whether we
	are the primary beneficiary at the time we first become involved
	with a VIE and subsequently reconsider that we are the primary
	beneficiary based on certain events. The evaluation of whether a
	fund is a VIE is subject to the requirements of

	ASC 810-10,

	originally issued as FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), and the
	determination of whether we should consolidate such VIE requires
	judgment. These judgments include whether the equity investment
	at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
	activities without additional subordinated financial support;
	evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make
	decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the
	entity; determining whether two or more parties equity
	interests should be aggregated; determining whether the equity
	investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations
	to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity;
	evaluating the nature of relationships and activities of the
	parties involved in determining which party within a
	related-party group is most closely associated with a VIE; and
	estimating cash flows in evaluating which member within the
	equity group absorbs a majority of the expected losses and hence
	would be deemed the primary beneficiary.


	 


	For all Carlyle funds and co-investment entities (collectively
	the funds) that are not determined to be VIEs, we
	consolidate those funds where, as the sole general partner, we
	have not overcome the presumption of control pursuant to
	U.S. GAAP.

	Consolidation and Deconsolidation of Carlyle Funds and
	Certain Co-investment Entities.

	  Most Carlyle
	funds provide a dissolution right upon a simple majority vote of
	the non-Carlyle affiliated limited partners such that the
	presumption of control by us is overcome. Accordingly, these
	funds are not consolidated in our combined and consolidated
	financial statements. Certain Carlyle-sponsored funds near the
	end of their partnership term do not provide the same
	dissolution right. These funds consist mainly of one of our U.S.
	buyout funds (CP II) and its related entities, and these are
	consolidated in our combined and consolidated financial
	statements. The assets of the Consolidated Funds are classified
	principally within investments of Consolidated Funds. The assets
	and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally within
	separate legal entities. Therefore, the liabilities of the
	Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us and our general
	creditors.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  Performance fees consist
	principally of the preferential allocation of profits to which
	we are entitled from certain of our funds (commonly known as
	carried interest). We are generally entitled to a 20% allocation
	(or 1.8% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds
	vehicles) of income as a carried interest after returning the
	invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns and return
	of certain fund costs (subject to

	catch-up

	provisions). Carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of
	the funds investment values above certain return hurdles
	set forth in each respective partnership agreement. We recognize
	revenues attributable to performance fees based on the amount
	that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at
	each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date.
	Accordingly, the amount recognized as performance fees reflects
	our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated
	funds underlying investments.


	 


	We may be required to return realized carried interests in the
	future if the funds investment values decline below
	certain levels. When the fair value of a funds investments
	fall below certain return hurdles, previously recognized
	performance fees are reduced, as occurred for certain funds in
	2009 and 2008. In all cases, each fund is considered separately
	in that regard and for a given fund, performance fees can never
	be negative over the life of a fund. If upon a hypothetical
	liquidation of a funds investments at the current fair
	values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest
	would be required to be returned, a liability is established for
	the potential giveback obligation. Senior Carlyle professionals
	and employees who have received distributions of carried
	interest which are ultimately returned are contractually
	obligated to reimburse us for the amount returned. We record a
	receivable from current and former employees and our current and
	former senior Carlyle professionals for their individual portion
	of any giveback obligation that we establish. These receivables
	are included in due from affiliates and other receivables, net
	in our combined and consolidated balance sheets.


	 


	The timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of
	investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the
	partnership agreements that govern such funds, which generally
	allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an
	investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of
	obligations relating to the return of capital, any realized
	losses, applicable fees and expenses and the applicable annual
	preferred limited partner return. Distributions to eligible
	senior Carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest
	are generally made shortly thereafter. The giveback obligation,
	if any, in respect of previously realized carried interest is
	generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation
	of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the funds
	partnership agreement.


	 


	In addition to our performance fees from our private equity
	funds, we are also entitled to receive performance fees from
	certain of our other global credit alternatives funds when the
	return on AUM exceeds certain benchmark returns or other
	performance targets. In such arrangements, performance fees are
	recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved and
	are included in performance fees in the accompanying combined
	and consolidated statements of operations.


	 



	Performance Fees due to Employees and
	Advisors.

	  We have allocated a portion of the
	performance fees due to us to our employees and advisors. These
	amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction
	with the related performance fee revenue and, until paid,
	recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and
	benefits liability. Upon any reversal of performance fee
	revenue, the related compensation expense is also reversed.




	174








	 







	Income Taxes.

	  No provision has been made for
	U.S. federal income taxes in our combined and consolidated
	financial statements since we are a group of pass-through
	entities for U.S. income tax purposes and our profits and
	losses are allocated to the senior Carlyle professionals who are
	individually responsible for reporting such amounts. Based on
	applicable foreign, state and local tax laws, we record a
	provision for income taxes for certain entities. We record a
	provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities
	based on applicable laws. Tax positions taken by us are subject
	to periodic audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign
	taxing authorities.


	 


	Upon completion of our Reorganization and related offering,
	certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of Carlyle and the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships will be subject to federal, state
	and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the
	related tax provision attributable to Carlyles share of
	this income will be reflected in the consolidated financial
	statements. The Reorganization and offering may result in
	Carlyle recording a significant deferred tax asset based on then
	enacted tax rates, which will result in future tax deductions.
	Over time, a substantial portion of this asset will be offset by
	a liability associated with the tax receivable agreement with
	our senior Carlyle professionals. The realization of our
	deferred tax assets will be dependent on the amount of our
	future taxable income before deductions related to the
	establishment of the deferred tax asset.


	 


	We use the liability method of accounting for deferred income
	taxes pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Under this method, deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
	consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
	carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their
	respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	measured using the statutory tax rates expected to be applied in
	the periods in which those temporary differences are settled.
	The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
	liabilities is recognized in the period of the change. A
	valuation allowance is recorded on our net deferred tax assets
	when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be
	realized.


	 


	Under U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit
	to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more
	likely than not to be sustained upon examination. When
	appropriate, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions,
	which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and
	other liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance
	sheets. These balances include interest and penalties associated
	with uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest accrued and
	penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision
	for income taxes. If recognized, the entire amount of
	unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in
	the provision for income taxes.


	 



	Fair Value Measurement.

	  U.S. GAAP
	establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the
	observability of inputs used in measuring financial
	instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is
	impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial
	instruments and their specific characteristics. Financial
	instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which
	fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets,
	generally will have a higher degree of market price
	observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in
	determining fair value.


	 


	The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined
	as follows:


	 



	Level I

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for
	identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of
	financial instruments included in Level I include
	unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives,
	listed in active markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for
	these instruments, even in situations where we hold a large
	position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.


	 



	Level II

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets,
	which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
	reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this
	category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed
	in active markets, securities traded in other than active
	markets, government and agency securities, and certain

	over-the-counter

	derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.





	175








	 






	Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when
	their net asset value is redeemable without significant
	restriction.


	 



	Level III

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair
	value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair
	value require significant management judgment or estimation.
	Financial instruments that are included in this category include
	investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade
	residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan
	obligations, and certain

	over-the-counter

	derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable
	inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in
	this category.


	 


	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall
	into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
	cases, a financial instruments level within the fair value
	hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is
	significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
	significance of a particular input to any of our fair value
	measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to
	each relevant investment, non-investment grade residual
	interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations,
	and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is
	based on unobservable inputs.


	 


	The table below summarizes the valuation of investments and
	other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment
	and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2011:

	Negative Fair Value amounts relate
	to shorts and derivative instruments in our hedge funds.
	Corresponding cash collateral amounts have been included in
	Other Net Asset Value.





	 


	In the absence of observable market prices, we value our
	investments using valuation methodologies applied on a
	consistent basis. For some investments little market activity
	may exist. Our determination of fair value is then based on the
	best information available in the circumstances and may
	incorporate our own assumptions and involves a significant
	degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of
	internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk
	adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments
	for which market prices are not observable include private
	investments in the equity of operating companies, real estate
	properties and certain debt positions. The valuation technique
	for each of these investments is described below:


	 



	Corporate Private Equity Investments

	  The fair
	values of corporate private equity investments are determined by
	reference to projected net earnings, earnings before interest,
	taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the
	discounted cash flow method, public market or private
	transactions, valuations for comparable companies and other
	measures which, in many cases, are unaudited at the time
	received. Valuations may be derived by reference to observable
	valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions
	(e.g., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee
	company such as EBITDA by a relevant valuation multiple observed
	in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted
	by us for





	176








	 






	differences between the investment and the referenced
	comparables, and in some instances by reference to option
	pricing models or other similar models. Certain fund investments
	in our real assets, global market strategies and fund of funds
	solutions segments are comparable to corporate private equity
	and are valued in accordance with these policies.


	 



	Real Estate Investments

	  The fair values of
	real estate investments are determined by considering projected
	operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and
	replacement costs, among other measures. The methods used to
	estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the
	discounted cash flow method

	and/or

	capitalization rates (cap rates) analysis.
	Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation
	measures for comparable assets (e.g., multiplying a key
	performance metric of the investee asset, such as net operating
	income, by a relevant cap rate observed in the range of
	comparable transactions), adjusted by us for differences between
	the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some
	instances by reference to pricing models or other similar
	methods. Additionally, where applicable, projected distributable
	cash flow through debt maturity will also be considered in
	support of the investments carrying value.


	 



	Credit-Oriented Investments

	  The fair values
	of credit-oriented investments are generally determined on the
	basis of prices between market participants provided by
	reputable dealers or pricing services. Specifically, for
	investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds,
	the fair values are generally determined by valuations of
	comparable investments. In some instances, we may utilize other
	valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.


	 



	CLO Investments and CLO Loans Payable

	  We have
	elected the fair value option to measure the loans payable of
	the CLOs at fair value subsequent to the date of initial
	adoption of the new consolidation rules, as we have determined
	that measurement of the loans payable and preferred shares
	issued by the CLOs at fair value better correlates with the
	value of the assets held by the CLOs, which are held to provide
	the cash flows for the note obligations. The investments of the
	CLOs are also carried at fair value.


	 


	The fair values of the CLO loan and bond assets were primarily
	based on quotations from reputable dealers or relevant pricing
	services. In situations where valuation quotations are
	unavailable, the assets are valued based on similar securities,
	market index changes, and other factors. We corroborate
	quotations from pricing services either with other available
	pricing data or with our own models.


	 


	The fair values of the CLO loans payable and the CLO structured
	asset positions were determined based on both discounted cash
	flow analyses and third-party quotes. Those analyses considered
	the position size, liquidity and current financial condition of
	the CLOs, the third-party financing environment, reinvestment
	rates, recovery lags, discount rates, and default forecasts and
	is compared to broker quotations from market makers and third
	party dealers.


	 


	Generally, the bonds and loans in the CLOs are not actively
	traded and are classified as Level III.


	 


	Net income from our consolidated CLOs resulting from underlying
	investment performance is substantially attributable to the
	investors in the CLOs and accordingly is reflected in
	non-controlling interests. A 10% change in value of the CLO
	investments (approximately $10.3 billion as of
	December 31, 2011) coupled with a correlated 10% change in
	value of the loans payable of the CLOs (approximately
	$9.7 billion as of December 31, 2011) will result in
	no material net income or loss to the non-controlling interests.
	However, if the investments in the CLOs change in value in an
	uncorrelated manner with the CLO liabilities, then the impact on
	net income attributable to non-controlling interests could be
	significant. Regardless, the impact on net income attributable
	to Carlyle Group is not significant.


	 



	Fund Investments

	  Our investments in
	funds are valued based on our proportionate share of the net
	assets provided by the third party general partners of the
	underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available
	information which is typically a lag of up to





	177








	 






	90 days. The terms of the investments generally preclude
	the ability to redeem the investment. Distributions from these
	investments will be received as the underlying assets in the
	funds are liquidated, the timing of which cannot be readily
	determined.


	 


	Investments include our ownership interests in the funds and the
	investments held by the Consolidated Funds. The valuation
	procedures utilized for investments of the funds vary depending
	on the nature of the investment. The fair value of investments
	in publicly traded securities is based on the closing price of
	the security with adjustments to reflect appropriate discounts
	if the securities are subject to restrictions. Upon the sale of
	a security, the realized net gain or loss is computed on a
	weighted average cost basis.


	 


	The valuation methodologies described above can involve
	subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established
	pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could
	result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued
	performance fees. Because there is significant uncertainty in
	the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid
	investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in
	an investment funds net asset value do not necessarily
	reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the
	investment fund when such investments are realized. Realizations
	at values significantly lower than the values at which
	investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values
	would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable
	fund, the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees
	and in the case of our hedge funds, management fees. Changes in
	values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may
	result in volatility in the net asset values and results of
	operations that we report from period to period. Also, a
	situation where asset values turn out to be materially different
	than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause
	investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result
	in difficulty in raising additional funds. See Risk
	Factors  Risks Related to Our Company 
	Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can
	involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets
	established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect,
	which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and
	accrued performance fees.


	 



	Compensation and Distributions Payable to Carlyle
	Partners.

	  Compensation attributable to our senior
	Carlyle professionals has historically been accounted for as
	distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation.
	We have historically recognized a distribution from capital and
	distribution payable to our individual senior Carlyle
	professionals when services are rendered and carried interest
	allocations are earned. Any unpaid distributions, which reflect
	our obligation to those senior Carlyle professionals, are
	presented as due to senior Carlyle professionals in our combined
	and consolidated balance sheets. Upon completion of our
	Reorganization and related offering, we will account for
	compensation attributable to our senior Carlyle professionals as
	an expense in our statement of operations. Accordingly, this
	will have the effect of increasing compensation expense relative
	to what has historically been recorded in our financial
	statements.


	 



	Equity-based Compensation.

	  Upon completion of
	our Reorganization and related offering, we will implement
	equity-based compensation arrangements that will require senior
	Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of
	their equity interests over future service periods. This will
	result in compensation charges over future periods under
	U.S. GAAP. In determining the aggregate fair value of any
	award grants, we will need to make judgments, among others, as
	to the grant date and estimated forfeiture rates. Each of these
	elements, particularly the forfeiture assumptions used in
	valuing our equity awards, are subject to significant judgment
	and variability and the impact of changes in such elements on
	equity-based compensation expense could be material.


	 



	Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

	  Our intangible
	assets consist of acquired contractual rights to earn future fee
	income, including management and advisory fees, and acquired
	trademarks. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over
	their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment
	whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.




	178








	 






	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net
	assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional
	currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is recognized as an
	asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of
	October 1

	st

	 and
	between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that
	impairment may have occurred.



	 




	Recent
	and Pending Accounting Pronouncements





	 


	In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for fair value
	measurements and disclosures to converge U.S. GAAP and
	International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
	The amended guidance, included in ASU

	2011-04,


	Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
	Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP,

	is
	effective for us for our interim reporting period beginning
	after December 15, 2011. The amended guidance is generally
	clarifying in nature, but does change certain existing
	measurement principles in ASC 820 and requires additional
	disclosure about fair value measurements and unobservable
	inputs. We have not completed our assessment of the impact of
	this amended guidance, but do not expect the adoption to have a
	material impact on our financial statements.


	 


	In June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on the presentation
	of comprehensive income. This guidance eliminates the option to
	report other comprehensive income and its components in the
	consolidated statement of changes in equity. An entity may elect
	to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in
	one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of
	comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive,
	statements. Each component of net income and of other
	comprehensive income needs to be displayed under either
	alternative. In December 2011, the FASB issued a final standard
	to defer the new requirement to present components of
	reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of
	the income statement. This guidance is effective for interim and
	annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We
	adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2012, and the
	adoption did not have a material impact on our financial
	statements.


	 


	In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for testing
	goodwill for impairment by allowing an entity to use a
	qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. The
	amended guidance, included in ASU

	2011-08,


	Testing Goodwill for Impairment

	is effective
	for us for our annual reporting period beginning after
	December 15, 2011. The amended guidance is intended to
	reduce complexity by allowing an entity the option to make a
	qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill
	impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair
	value of a reporting unit. We do not expect the adoption to have
	a material impact on our financial statements.


	 


	In December 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for offsetting
	financial instruments. The amended guidance, included in ASU

	2011-11,


	Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting
	Assets and Liabilities,

	is effective for us for our
	annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1,
	2013. The amended guidance requires additional disclosure about
	netting arrangements to enable financial statement users to
	evaluate the effect or potential effect of such arrangements on
	an entitys financial position. We do not expect the
	adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.



	 




	Quantitative
	and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk





	 


	Our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as
	general partner or investment advisor to our investment funds
	and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their
	investments, including the effect on management fees,
	performance fees and investment income.


	 


	Although our investment funds share many common themes, each of
	our alternative asset management asset classes runs its own
	investment and risk management processes, subject to our overall
	risk tolerance and philosophy. The investment process of our
	investment funds involves a comprehensive due diligence
	approach, including review of reputation of shareholders and
	management, company size and sensitivity of cash flow
	generation, business sector and competitive





	179








	 






	risks, portfolio fit, exit risks and other key factors
	highlighted by the deal team. Key investment decisions are
	subject to approval by both the fund-level managing directors,
	as well as the investment committee, which is generally
	comprised of one or more of the three founding partners, one
	sector head, one or more operating executives and
	senior investment professionals associated with that particular
	fund. Once an investment in a portfolio company has been made,
	our fund teams closely monitor the performance of the portfolio
	company, generally through frequent contact with management and
	the receipt of financial and management reports.


	 





	Effect
	on Fund Management Fees





	 


	Management fees will only be directly affected by short-term
	changes in market conditions to the extent they are based on NAV
	or represent permanent impairments of value. These management
	fees will be increased (or reduced) in direct proportion to the
	effect of changes in the market value of our investments in the
	related funds. The proportion of our management fees that are
	based on NAV is dependent on the number and types of investment
	funds in existence and the current stage of each funds
	life cycle. For the year ended December 31, 2011,
	approximately 10% of our fund management fees were based on the
	NAV of the applicable funds.


	 





	Effect
	on Performance Fees





	 


	Performance fees reflect revenue primarily from carried interest
	on our carry funds and incentive fees from our hedge funds. In
	our discussion of Key Financial Measures and
	Critical Accounting Policies, we disclose that
	performance fees are recognized upon appreciation of the
	valuation of our funds investments above certain return
	hurdles and are based upon the amount that would be due to
	Carlyle at each reporting date as if the funds were liquidated
	at their then-current fair values. Changes in the fair value of
	the funds investments may materially impact performance
	fees depending upon the respective funds performance to date as
	compared to its hurdle rate and the related carry waterfall. The
	following table summarizes the incremental impact, including our
	Consolidated Funds, of a 10% change in total remaining fair
	value by segment as of December 31, 2011 on our performance
	fee revenue:

	Effect
	on Assets Under Management





	 


	With the exception of our hedge funds, our fee-earning assets
	under management are generally not affected by changes in
	valuation. However, total assets under management is impacted by
	valuation changes to net asset value. The table below shows the
	net asset value included in total assets under management by
	segment (excluding available capital), and the percentage amount
	classified as Level III investments as defined within the
	fair value standards of GAAP:

	Exchange
	Rate Risk





	 


	Our investment funds hold investments that are denominated in

	non-U.S. dollar

	currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of
	exchange between the U.S. dollar and

	non-U.S. dollar

	currencies.

	Non-U.S. dollar

	denominated assets and liabilities are translated at year-end
	rates of exchange, and the combined and consolidated statements
	of operations accounts are translated at rates of exchange in
	effect throughout the year. Additionally, a portion of our
	management fees are denominated in

	non-U.S. dollar

	currencies. We estimate that as of December 31, 2011, if
	the U.S. dollar strengthened 10% against all foreign
	currencies, the impact on our consolidated results of operations
	for the year then ended would be as follows: (a) fund
	management fees would decrease by $26.6 million,
	(b) performance fees would decrease by $2.7 million
	and (c) investment income would decrease by
	$1.4 million.


	 




	Interest
	Rate Risk




	 


	We have obligations under our term loan facility that accrue
	interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes may therefore
	affect the amount of interest payments, future earnings and cash
	flows.


	 


	We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our
	variable rate debt financing. To manage this risk, we entered
	into an interest rate swap in March 2008 to fix the interest
	rate on approximately 33% of the $725.0 million in term
	loan borrowings at 5.069%. The interest rate swap had an initial
	notional balance of $239.2 million, a current balance of
	$149.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and amortizes
	through August 20, 2013 (the swaps maturity date) as
	the related term loan borrowings are repaid. This instrument was
	designated as a cash flow hedge and remains in place after the
	amendment of the senior secured credit facility. The interest
	rate swap continues to be designated as a cash flow hedge.


	 


	In December 2011, we entered into a second interest rate swap
	with an initial notional balance of $350.5 million to fix
	the interest rate at 2.832% on the remaining term loan
	borrowings not hedged by the March 2008 interest rate swap. This
	interest rate swap matures on September 30, 2016, which
	coincides with the maturity of the term loan. This instrument
	has been designated as a cash flow hedge.


	 


	Based on our debt obligations payable and our interest rate
	swaps as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that interest
	expense relating to variable rates would increase by
	approximately $3 million on an annual basis, in the event
	interest rates were to increase by one percentage point.


	 





	Credit
	Risk





	 


	Certain of our investment funds hold derivative instruments that
	contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties
	are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. We minimize our
	risk exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter
	into contracts to banks and investment banks who meet
	established credit and capital guidelines. We do not expect any
	counterparty to default on its obligations and therefore do not
	expect to incur any loss due to counterparty default.

	UNAUDITED
	PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION





	 


	The following unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro
	forma statement of operations for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 and the unaudited condensed combined and
	consolidated pro forma balance sheet as of December 31,
	2011 are based upon the historical financial statements included
	elsewhere in this prospectus and the historical financial
	statements of the Business Acquisitions (defined below). These
	pro forma financial statements present our consolidated results
	of operations and financial position giving pro forma effect to
	the Business Acquisitions, the Reorganization and Offering
	Transactions described under Organizational
	Structure and the other transactions described below as if
	such transactions had been completed as of January 1, 2011
	with respect to the unaudited condensed combined and
	consolidated pro forma statement of operations for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 and as of December 31, 2011
	with respect to the unaudited condensed combined and
	consolidated pro forma balance sheet. The pro forma adjustments
	are based on available information and upon assumptions that our
	management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro
	forma basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical
	combined and consolidated financial information of Carlyle
	Group. The adjustments are described in the notes to the
	unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma
	statement of operations and the unaudited condensed combined and
	consolidated pro forma balance sheet.


	 


	Carlyle Group is considered our predecessor for accounting
	purposes, and its combined and consolidated financial statements
	will be our historical financial statements following the
	completion of the Reorganization and this offering. Because the
	existing owners of the Parent Entities control the entities that
	comprise Carlyle Group before and after the Reorganization, we
	will account for the transaction among these owners
	interests in our business, as part of the Reorganization, as a
	transfer of interests under common control. Accordingly, we will
	carry forward unchanged the value of these owners
	interests in the assets and liabilities recognized in Carlyle
	Groups combined and consolidated financial statements into
	our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	The pro forma adjustments in the

	Business Acquisitions

	column give effect to the following transactions:


	 












	 


	 


	The acquisition by Carlyle Group in July 2011 of a 60% equity
	interest in AlpInvest, one of the worlds largest investors
	in private equity which advises a global private equity and
	mezzanine fund of funds program and related co-investment and
	secondary activities.




	 




	 


	 


	The acquisition by Carlyle Group in July 2011 of a 55% interest
	in ESG, an emerging markets equities and macroeconomic
	strategies investment manager.




	 


	Since the acquisitions of AlpInvest and ESG were completed in
	July 2011, the impact of these transactions is fully reflected
	in the historical Carlyle Group combined and consolidated
	balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, and therefore no
	adjustments are necessary to the unaudited pro forma balance
	sheet as of December 31, 2011. Also, the results of
	operations of AlpInvest and ESG for the period from July 1,
	2011 through December 31, 2011 are reflected in the
	historical Carlyle Group combined and consolidated statement of
	operations, and therefore the pro forma adjustment to the
	unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma
	statement of operations reflects the results of operations of
	AlpInvest and ESG for the period from January 1, 2011
	through June 30, 2011.


	 


	The acquisitions of AlpInvest and ESG are collectively
	hereinafter referred to as the Business
	Acquisitions. The pro forma adjustments for the Business
	Acquisitions are based on the historical financial statements of
	the Business Acquisitions presented under U.S. GAAP and include
	assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The pro forma
	adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies or cost
	savings that we may achieve, any additional expenses that may be
	incurred with respect to operating the combined company, or the
	costs of integration that the combined company may incur. The
	pro forma adjustments give effect to events that are
	(i) directly attributable to the





	182








	 






	Business Acquisitions, (ii) factually supportable, and
	(iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
	results of the companies.


	 


	The pro forma adjustments in the

	Reorganization and Other
	Adjustments

	column principally give effect to certain of the
	Reorganization and Offering Transactions described under
	Organizational Structure, including:


	 












	 


	 


	the restructuring of certain beneficial interests in investments
	in or alongside our funds that were funded by certain existing
	and former owners of the Parent Entities indirectly through the
	Parent Entities, such that the Parent Entities have
	(i) distributed a portion of these interests so that they
	are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated
	in our financial statements, and (ii) restructured the
	remainder of these interests so that they are reflected as
	non-controlling interests in our financial statements;




	 




	 


	 


	the redemption in March 2012 using borrowings on the revolving
	credit facility of our existing senior secured credit facility
	of the remaining $250 million aggregate principal amount of
	the subordinated notes. As a result of this redemption and the
	preceding redemption in October 2011 of $250 million
	aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes, all of the
	subordinated notes have been fully redeemed;




	 




	 


	 


	the restructuring of certain carried interest rights allocated
	to retired senior Carlyle professionals so that such carried
	interest rights will be reflected as non-controlling interests
	in our financial statements. Our retired senior Carlyle
	professionals who have existing carried interests rights through
	their ownership in the Parent Entities did not participate in
	the transactions described in Reorganization and Offering
	Transactions under Organizational Structure. The
	carried interest rights held by these individuals have been
	restructured such that they have exchanged their existing
	carried interest rights (through their ownership interests in
	the Parent Entities) for an equivalent amount of carried
	interest rights in the general partners of our funds. The
	individuals maintain the same carried interest rights before and
	after this restructuring, and no consideration in any form is
	being provided to them;




	 




	 


	 


	the reallocation of carried interest to senior Carlyle
	professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds,
	such that the allocation to these individuals will be
	approximately 45% of all carried interest on a blended average
	basis, with the exception of the Riverstone funds, where Carlyle
	will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are
	entitled under our arrangements for those funds;




	 




	 


	 


	an adjustment to reflect compensation attributable to our senior
	Carlyle professionals as compensation expense rather than as
	distributions from equity, as well as an adjustment to
	reclassify the liability for amounts owed to our senior Carlyle
	professionals from due to Carlyle partners to accrued
	compensation and benefits; and




	 




	 


	 


	a provision for corporate income taxes on the income of The
	Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned subsidiaries that will be
	taxable for U.S. income tax purposes, which we refer to as
	the corporate taxpayers.




	 


	The pro forma adjustments in the

	Offering Adjustments

	column principally give effect to certain of the
	Reorganization and Offering Transactions described under
	Organizational Structure, including:


	 












	 


	 


	a distribution that our Parent Entities have made to their
	owners of previously undistributed earnings totaling
	$28.0 million;




	 




	 


	 


	an adjustment to reflect compensation expense related to the
	issuance and vesting of Carlyle Holdings partnership units as
	part of the Carlyle Holdings formation;






	183








	 






	 












	 


	 


	an adjustment to reflect compensation expense related to the
	grant and vesting of the deferred restricted common units of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. and the phantom deferred restricted common
	units, which were granted to our employees at the time of this
	offering;




	 




	 


	 


	the issuance of 30,500,000 common units in this offering at an
	initial public offering price of $22.00 per common unit, less
	estimated underwriting discounts and the payment of offering
	expenses by Carlyle Holdings;




	 




	 


	 


	the purchase by The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned
	subsidiaries of newly-issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	for cash with the proceeds from this offering; and




	 




	 


	 


	the application by Carlyle Holdings of a portion of the proceeds
	from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness, as
	described in Use of Proceeds.




	 


	The pro forma adjustments in the

	Adjustments for

	Non-Controlling

	Interests

	column relate to an adjustment to non-controlling
	interests in consolidated entities representing the Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units held by our existing owners after
	this offering. Prior to the completion of this offering, our
	existing owners will contribute all of their interests in the
	Parent Entities to Carlyle Holdings in exchange for an
	equivalent fair value of Carlyle Holdings partnership units. The
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by the existing owners
	will be reflected as non-controlling interests in Carlyle
	Holdings in the combined and consolidated financial statements
	of The Carlyle Group L.P.


	 


	As described in greater detail under Certain Relationships
	and Related Person Transactions  Tax Receivable
	Agreement, we have entered into a tax receivable agreement
	with our existing owners that provides for the payment by the
	corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of 85% of the amount
	of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers realize
	as a result of the exchange by the limited partners of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships for The Carlyle Group, L.P. common
	units and the resulting increases in tax basis and of certain
	other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable
	agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under
	the tax receivable agreement. No such exchanges or other tax
	benefits have been assumed in the unaudited pro forma financial
	information and therefore no pro forma adjustment related to the
	tax receivable agreement is necessary.


	 


	As a public company, we will be implementing additional
	procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the
	standards and requirements applicable to public companies. We
	expect to incur significant additional annual expenses related
	to these steps and, among other things, additional directors and
	officers liability insurance, director fees, reporting
	requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, hiring additional
	accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased
	auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We have not
	included any pro forma adjustments relating to these costs.


	 


	The unaudited condensed pro forma financial information should
	be read together with Organizational Structure,
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations and the historical
	financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
	this prospectus.


	 


	The unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma
	financial information is included for informational purposes
	only and does not purport to reflect the results of operations
	or financial position of Carlyle Group that would have occurred
	had the transactions described above occurred on the dates
	indicated or had we operated as a public entity during the
	periods presented or for any future period or date. The
	unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma
	financial information should not be relied upon as being
	indicative of our future or actual results of operations or
	financial condition had the Business Acquisitions,
	Reorganization and Offering Transactions described under
	Organizational Structure and the other transactions
	described above occurred on the dates assumed. The unaudited
	condensed combined and consolidated pro forma financial
	information also does not project our results of operations or
	financial position for any future period or date.

	Notes to
	Unaudited Condensed Combined and Consolidated Pro Forma Balance
	Sheet

	as of December 31, 2011





	 












	1.  






	Reorganization
	and Other Adjustments







	 












	 


	(a) 


	Reflects the restructuring of certain beneficial interests in
	investments in or alongside our funds (including a note
	receivable), that were funded by certain existing and former
	owners of the Parent Entities indirectly through the Parent
	Entities. As part of the Reorganization, approximately $118.5
	million of these interests at December 31, 2011 were distributed
	so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer
	consolidated in our financial statements, and approximately
	$84.8 million of these interests at December 31, 2011 will be
	restructured so that they will be reported as non-controlling
	interests in our financial statements. The combined effect is a
	$203.3 million reduction to our members equity.




	 




	 


	    


	Historically, these beneficial interests were funded through
	capital contributions to the Parent Entities, which were then
	invested into the respective fund. Accordingly, in the
	historical financial statements of Carlyle Group, these
	beneficial interests were included in the captions
	investments and accrued performance fees, due
	from affiliates and other receivables, net and
	members equity on the Carlyle Group balance
	sheet, and investment income/losses on such interests were
	included in investment income (loss), interest
	and other income and net income attributable to
	Carlyle Group on the Carlyle Group statement of operations.




	 




	 


	    


	For the beneficial interests that were distributed that will be
	held directly by such persons, a pro forma adjustment has been
	recorded to decrease investments, due from affiliates, and
	members equity, as such interests will be distributed from
	the Parent Entities to the beneficial owners. Included in the
	distributed beneficial interests were $30.0 million of
	interests in our CLOs that are included in our Consolidated
	Funds; in the Carlyle Group historical combined and consolidated
	financial statements, these investments (in the form of debt
	securities issued by the CLO or equity interests in the CLO) had
	been eliminated against the related liability or equity recorded
	by the consolidated CLO. For these interests in consolidated
	CLOs, the pro forma adjustment results in increases to loans
	payable of Consolidated Funds and equity appropriated for
	Consolidated Funds (as the aforementioned elimination is no
	longer applicable after the debt securities or equity interests
	are held directly by the beneficial owner) and a decrease to
	members equity to reflect the distribution of the interest.




	 




	 


	    


	For the restructured beneficial interests that will be reflected
	as non-controlling interests totaling $84.8 million at
	December 31, 2011, a pro forma adjustment has been recorded
	to decrease members equity and increase non-controlling
	interests in consolidated entities, as such interests have been
	distributed from the Parent Entities to a legal entity that is
	not consolidated by Carlyle Holdings. The underlying investment
	(asset) related to those interests continues to be held by a
	consolidated subsidiary of Carlyle Holdings and the beneficial
	interests held by the non-consolidated legal entity are
	interests directly in the consolidated subsidiary.

	The pro forma adjustments are based on the carrying amounts of
	these beneficial interests in the historical financial
	statements. The following table summarizes the pro forma impact
	for the restructured beneficial interests (amounts in millions):

	Subsequent to the completion of the Reorganization, we will
	account for the restructured beneficial interests as
	investments and accrued performance fees and
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities
	and the distributed beneficial interests associated with
	consolidated CLOs as loans payable of Consolidated
	Funds and equity appropriated for Consolidated
	Funds. There will be no ongoing accounting for the other
	distributed beneficial interests after the Reorganization is
	complete.


	 












	 


	(b) 


	Reflects the redemption in March 2012 of the remaining $250
	million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated loan
	payable to affiliate for a redemption price of
	$260.0 million. There was no accrued interest liability at
	December 31, 2011 on the subordinated loan payable to affiliate.
	The redemption was funded through borrowings on the revolving
	credit facility of Carlyle Groups existing senior secured
	credit facility. This transaction resulted in a non-recurring
	gain of $2.5 million, representing the difference between the
	fair value of the subordinated notes at December 31, 2011 of
	$262.5 million and the redemption value of $260.0 million. As a
	result of this redemption and the preceding redemption in
	October 2011 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of the
	subordinated notes, all of the subordinated notes have been
	fully redeemed.




	 












	 


	(c) 


	Reflects the reclassification of amounts owed to senior Carlyle
	professionals to accrued compensation and benefits. Prior to the
	Reorganization and this offering, the entities that comprise
	Carlyle Group have been partnerships or limited liability
	companies, and our senior Carlyle professionals were part of the
	ownership group of those entities. In the historical financial
	statements, the liability to senior Carlyle professionals for
	amounts owed to them (primarily compensation and performance fee
	related compensation) was reported separately from compensation
	amounts owed to other Carlyle employees. Subsequent to the
	Reorganization, the liability for compensation amounts owed to
	senior Carlyle professionals and other Carlyle employees will be
	aggregated on our balance sheet.




	 












	 


	(d) 


	Reflects the reallocation of carried interest to senior Carlyle
	professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds,
	such that the allocation to these individuals will be
	approximately 45% of all carried interest on a blended average
	basis, with the exception of the Riverstone funds, where Carlyle
	will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are
	entitled under our arrangements for those funds. As part of the
	Reorganization, our senior Carlyle professionals and other
	individuals who manage our carry funds will contribute to
	Carlyle







	187








	 






	 



	Holdings a portion of the equity interests they own in the
	general partners of our existing carry funds in exchange for an
	equivalent fair value of Carlyle Holdings partnership units.


	 












	 


	    


	Historically, these allocations of carried interest were
	accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements. This
	adjustment reduces accrued compensation as of December 31,
	2011 and increases members equity, to reflect the
	elimination of the compensation liability through the issuance
	of Carlyle Holdings partnership units in the exchange. As of
	December 31, 2011, the compensation liability related to
	this exchange was $158.2 million. The fair value of the
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units issued in this transaction
	will exceed the carrying value of the liability, resulting in a
	loss on the exchange of $107.8 million. As the loss on the
	exchange represents a material non-recurring charge, it has been
	excluded from the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated
	pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December
	31, 2011. The pro forma increase to members equity related
	to the issuance of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units less
	the decrease to members equity for the loss on the
	exchange results in a net pro forma increase to members
	equity of $158.2 million. The amounts for this adjustment have
	been derived from our historical results.




	 


	Subsequent to the completion of the Reorganization and this
	offering, we will continue to account for the remaining equity
	interests that our senior Carlyle professionals and other
	individuals who manage our carry funds own in the general
	partners of our existing carry funds as compensatory profit
	sharing arrangements.


	 












	 


	(e) 


	Reflects the restructuring of ownership of certain carried
	interest rights allocated to retired senior Carlyle
	professionals so that such carried interest rights will be
	reflected as non-controlling interests. Our retired senior
	Carlyle professionals who have existing carried interests rights
	through their ownership in the Parent Entities did not
	participate in the transactions described in Reorganization and
	Offering Transactions under Organizational
	Structure. The carried interest rights held by these
	individuals have been restructured such that they have exchanged
	their existing carried interest rights (through their ownership
	interests in the Parent Entities) for an equivalent amount of
	carried interest rights directly in the consolidated general
	partners of our funds. The individuals maintain the same carried
	interest rights before and after this restructuring, and no
	consideration in any form is being provided to them.
	Historically, these interests were reflected within
	members equity on the Carlyle Group balance
	sheet, as these interests existed through the individuals
	ownership interests in the Parent Entities, and the income
	attributable to these carried interest rights was included in
	net income attributable to Carlyle Group on the
	Carlyle Group statement of operations because their interests
	were part of the controlling interest in Carlyle Group. The
	amounts for this adjustment have been derived from our
	historical results. At December 31, 2011, the carrying
	value of these restructured carried interest rights was
	approximately $78.6 million. This adjustment has been
	recorded to reclassify this balance from members equity to
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities.




	 


	Subsequent to the completion of the Reorganization, we will
	account for the carried interest rights allocated to retired
	senior Carlyle professionals as non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities.

	Offering
	Adjustments







	 












	 


	(a) 


	Reflects net proceeds of $619.9 million from this offering
	through the issuance of 30,500,000 common units at an
	initial public offering price of $22.00 per common unit, less
	estimated underwriting discounts of $31.9 million, with a
	corresponding increase to members equity. The net cash
	proceeds reflect a reduction of $19.2 million for expenses
	of the offering that Carlyle Holdings will bear or reimburse to
	The Carlyle Group L.P. See note 3(a).




	 




	 


	(b) 


	Reflects an adjustment to record deferred tax assets
	(liabilities) for outside tax basis differences created as a
	result of Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc.s investment in
	Carlyle Holdings I L.P. In connection with the offering, Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc. will use offering proceeds to purchase its
	interest in Carlyle Holdings I L.P. As a result of the dilution
	that







	188








	 






	 













	 




	will occur from the purchase of interests in Carlyle Holdings I
	L.P. at a valuation in excess of the proportion of the book
	value of net assets acquired, there will be a tax basis
	difference associated with this investment. This adjustment is
	recorded to recognize the deferred tax assets (liabilities) for
	the difference between Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc.s tax
	basis and its GAAP basis related to its investment to the extent
	such differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable
	future. The following table summarizes the pro forma adjustment
	as of December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions):

	Entities prior to the date of the offering in an aggregate
	amount of $28.0 million.




	 












	 


	(d) 


	Reflects the use of the proceeds from this offering and existing
	cash to: (i) repay the outstanding principal amount of the
	loans associated with the Claren Road acquisition of
	$40.0 million and $10.0 million as of
	December 31, 2011, which mature on December 31, 2015
	and January 3, 2017 and bear interest at 6.0% and 8.0%,
	respectively, and (ii) repay $570.9 million of the
	outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of
	Carlyle Groups existing senior secured credit facility
	(representing the pro forma outstanding balance as of
	December 31, 2011), which matures on September 30,
	2016 and currently bears interest at a rate equal to, at our
	option, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an
	applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus
	an applicable margin not to exceed 1.75% (2.05% at
	December 31, 2011).




	 


	We intend to repay $618.1 million of the outstanding
	indebtedness under the revolving credit facility with the
	proceeds from this offering, which reflects additional
	borrowings on the revolving credit facility in 2012 not included
	in the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma
	balance sheet. See Use of Proceeds.


	 













	3.  






	Adjustments
	for Non-Controlling Interests







	 












	 


	(a) 


	Our existing owners will contribute to Carlyle Holdings their
	interests in the Parent Entities and a portion of the equity
	interests they own in the general partners of our existing
	investment funds and other entities that have invested in or
	alongside our funds in exchange for partnership units in Carlyle
	Holdings. The exchange is structured as a fair value exchange
	where the existing owners will exchange their interests in the
	Parent Entities and general partners for an equivalent fair
	value of Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Each existing owner
	will receive a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units that
	is based on his/her individual interest in the Parent Entities
	and general partners, but in each case the individual will
	receive an equal number of partnership units in each of the
	three Carlyle Holdings partnerships.






	189








	 






	 



	 












	 


	    


	We will operate and control all of the business and affairs of
	Carlyle Holdings and will consolidate the financial results of
	Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries. The ownership interests
	of the existing owners in Carlyle Holdings will be reflected as
	a non-controlling interest in our financial statements. The
	following table summarizes the pro forma adjustment for
	non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings as of
	December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions):

	(1)






	Represents the pro forma total
	members equity for Carlyle Holdings prior to the impact of
	the Offering Adjustments. Prior to the offering transactions,
	all of the members equity of Carlyle Holdings is owned by
	the existing owners and would be classified as non-controlling
	interests in The Carlyle Group L.P. consolidated financial
	statements.





	 





	(2)






	See note 2(c).





	 





	(3)






	Reflects our use of the assumed net
	proceeds from the issuance of the common units in this offering
	to purchase newly issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units.
	Assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to
	purchase additional common units from us, we will directly and
	indirectly own 10.0% of the outstanding Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units upon the completion of this offering and the
	balance of the outstanding Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	will be owned by the existing owners.





	 









	We account for this portion of the
	Reorganization as a change in a parents ownership interest
	while retaining control; accordingly, we account for the cost of
	the Carlyle Holdings interests purchased as a reduction of
	non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings. The cost of
	interests purchased is $130.9 million, which is calculated
	as our share of the Carlyle Holdings pro forma members
	equity as adjusted for the offering of $1,278.1 million.





	 





	(4)






	Reflects the proceeds from the
	issuance of the common units in this offering of
	$671.0 million, less estimated underwriting discounts of
	$31.9 million, which will be used to purchase the newly
	issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Because we will
	purchase the interests in Carlyle Holdings at a valuation in
	excess of the proportion of the book value of net assets
	acquired, we will incur an immediate dilution of approximately
	$508.2 million, which is calculated as the net proceeds
	used by us to purchase the newly issued Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units of $639.1 million less the book value of
	such interests of $130.9 million. This dilution (the net
	impact of (3) and (4) herein) is reflected within
	members equity as a reallocation from members equity
	to non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings. See
	Organizational Structure  Offering
	Transactions and Use of Proceeds.





	 









	In connection with the
	Reorganization, we have entered into an exchange agreement with
	the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Under
	the exchange agreement, subject to the applicable vesting and
	minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer
	restrictions, each holder of Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	(and certain transferees thereof), other than the subsidiaries
	of The Carlyle Group L.P., may up to four times a year, from and
	after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this
	offering (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement),
	exchange these partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P.
	common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. Under the exchange
	agreement, to effect an exchange a holder of partnership units
	in Carlyle Holdings must simultaneously exchange one partnership
	unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. No such
	exchanges have been assumed in the calculation of the pro forma
	adjustment for non-controlling interests.

	Statement of Operations





	 












	1.  






	Business
	Acquisitions







	 


	On July 1, 2011, Carlyle Group acquired a 60% interest in
	AlpInvest, one of the worlds largest investors in private
	equity. The consolidated income statement for AlpInvest for the
	period from January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011 is
	derived from its unaudited financial statements not included in
	this prospectus.


	 


	On July 1, 2011, Carlyle Group acquired 55% of ESG, an
	emerging markets equities and macroeconomic strategies
	investment manager. The consolidated income statement of ESG for
	the period from January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011
	is derived from its unaudited financial statements not included
	in this prospectus.


	 


	Carlyle Group consolidates the financial position and results of
	operations of the Business Acquisitions effective on the date of
	the closing of each Business Acquisition, and has accounted for
	the Business Acquisitions as business combinations.


	 


	Since the AlpInvest and ESG acquisitions occurred on
	July 1, 2011, the impact of these acquisitions for the
	period from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 is
	fully reflected in the historical Carlyle Group combined and
	consolidated financial statements for the year ended
	December 31, 2011. Therefore, the adjustment necessary to
	the unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 represents the results of operations of
	AlpInvest and ESG for the period from January 1, 2011
	through June 30, 2011.


	 


	For additional information concerning the Business Acquisitions,
	please see Note 3 to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.

	The following tables summarize the pro forma impact to the
	Carlyle Group historical consolidated statement of operations
	from the Business Acquisitions for the period presented. For
	purposes of determining the impact to the unaudited condensed
	combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations, the
	Acquisitions are assumed to have occurred on January 1,
	2011.

	(a) 


	This adjustment reflects interest income on loans issued by
	Carlyle Group in conjunction with the AlpInvest acquisition of
	$1.7 million at its contractual annual interest rate of 7%.




	 




	 


	(b) 


	In conjunction with the Business Acquisitions, certain employees
	were admitted as senior Carlyle professionals. The entities that
	comprise Carlyle Group are partnerships or limited liability
	companies. Accordingly, all payments to our senior Carlyle
	professionals have been accounted for as distributions from
	members equity rather than as compensation expenses in the
	historical Carlyle Group financial statements. Accordingly, this
	adjustment reduces the historical compensation expenses of the
	Business Acquisitions for the amounts associated with those
	employees who are senior Carlyle professionals. Following this
	offering, we intend to account for compensation payments to our
	senior Carlyle professionals as compensation expenses. The
	amounts in this pro forma acquisition adjustment are included in
	that compensation pro forma adjustment (See note 2(b)).

	(c) 


	This adjustment reflects the amortization expense associated
	with intangible assets acquired from the Business Acquisitions.




	 












	 


	    


	The acquisition of AlpInvest included approximately
	$72.0 million of intangible assets with an estimated useful
	life of ten years. Amortization of the AlpInvest intangible
	assets of $3.6 million for the six months ended
	June 30, 2011 has been included in the pro forma adjustment.




	 




	 


	    


	The acquisition of ESG included approximately $89 million
	of intangible assets with an estimated useful life of seven
	years. Amortization of the ESG intangible assets of
	$6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011
	has been included in the pro forma adjustment.




	 




	 


	(d) 


	This adjustment reflects interest expense on Carlyle
	Groups borrowing of 81.0 million
	($116.6 million) on the revolving credit facility of its
	existing senior secured credit facility to finance the AlpInvest
	acquisition. The variable interest rate applied to the borrowing
	during the period presented ranged from 3.05% to 3.48%.




	 












	 


	(e) 


	This adjustment reflects the expected reduction of the deferred
	tax liabilities associated with the amortization of identifiable
	intangible assets arising from the AlpInvest and ESG
	acquisitions. The deferred tax liabilities will be reduced over
	the same period as the related identifiable intangible assets
	(see note (c) above) are amortized. The pro forma reduction
	of the AlpInvest deferred tax liabilities was $0.8 million
	for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The pro forma
	reduction of the ESG deferred tax liabilities was
	$0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011.




	 












	 


	(f) 


	This adjustment reflects the allocation of the pro-forma net
	income for the periods presented to the 40% non-controlling
	interests in AlpInvest. This adjustment allocates to the
	non-controlling interests 40% of the historical income
	attributable to the controlling interest for AlpInvest, 40% of
	the pro forma acquisition adjustments attributable to AlpInvest,
	and 100% of all carried interest income in respect of the
	historical investments and commitments to the AlpInvest fund of
	funds vehicles that existed as of December 31, 2010. The

	2.  






	Reorganization
	and Other Adjustments







	 












	 


	(a) 


	This adjustment reflects the restructuring of certain beneficial
	interests in investments in or alongside our funds (including a
	note receivable) that were funded by certain existing and
	formers owners of the Parent Entities indirectly through the
	Parent Entities. As part of the Reorganization, certain
	interests have been distributed so that they are held directly
	by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial
	statements, and certain other interests have been restructured
	so that they will be reported as non-controlling interests.






	194








	 






	 



	 












	 


	    


	Historically, these beneficial interests were funded through
	capital contributions to the Parent Entities, which were then
	invested into the respective fund. Accordingly, in the
	historical financial statements of Carlyle Group, these
	beneficial interests were included in the captions
	investments and accrued performance fees, due
	from affiliates and other receivables, net and
	members equity on the Carlyle Group balance
	sheet, and investment income/losses on such interests were
	included in investment income (loss), interest
	and other income and net income attributable to
	Carlyle Group on the Carlyle Group statement of operations.




	 




	 


	    


	For the beneficial interests that were distributed so that will
	be held directly by such persons, a pro forma adjustment has
	been recorded to eliminate the historical investment income
	associated with the investments with a corresponding decrease to
	net income attributable to Carlyle Group as they are no longer
	investments of Carlyle Holdings. Included in the distributed
	beneficial interests were certain interests in our CLOs that are
	included in our Consolidated Funds; in the Carlyle Group
	historical combined and consolidated financial statements, the
	investment income/loss on those interests had been eliminated
	against the related gain/loss recorded by the Consolidated Fund.
	For these interests in consolidated CLOs, the pro forma
	adjustment results in an adjustment to net investment gains
	(losses) of Consolidated Funds (as the aforementioned
	elimination is no longer applicable after the interest is held
	directly by the beneficial owner).




	 




	 


	    


	For the beneficial interests that will be reflected as
	non-controlling interests, a pro forma adjustment has been
	recorded to reclassify the income attributable to the
	restructured interests to income attributable to non-controlling
	interests in consolidated entities from income attributable to
	Carlyle Group. The underlying investment related to those
	interests continues to be held by a consolidated subsidiary of
	Carlyle Holdings and the beneficial interests are interests
	directly in the consolidated subsidiary.




	 




	 


	    


	The amounts for these adjustments were derived based on
	historical financial results. The following table summarizes the
	pro forma impact for the restructured beneficial interests:

	distributed beneficial interests associated with consolidated
	CLOs as net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated
	Funds. There will be no ongoing accounting for the other
	distributed beneficial interests after the Reorganization is
	complete.


	 












	 


	(b) 


	This adjustment reflects changes to compensation and benefits
	expenses associated with historical payments to our senior
	Carlyle professionals attributable to compensation and benefits
	and the reallocation of carried interest in our carry funds that
	are currently held by our senior Carlyle professionals and other

	adjustment is the change in the fair value of the liability
	associated with acquisition-related contingent consideration
	that is payable to senior Carlyle professionals based on the
	fulfillment of performance conditions. The effects of these
	items on our unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro

	(1)






	Reflects an adjustment to record
	base salary, annual bonus, and benefit expenses attributable to
	our senior Carlyle professionals as compensation expense.
	Additionally, performance fee related compensation attributable
	to our senior Carlyle professionals is included in this pro
	forma adjustment. Prior to the Reorganization and this offering,
	the entities that comprise Carlyle Group have been partnerships
	or limited liability companies. Accordingly, all payments to our
	senior Carlyle professionals generally have been accounted for
	as distributions from members equity rather than as
	compensation expenses. Following this offering, we intend to
	account for compensation payments to our senior Carlyle
	professionals as compensation expenses. Amounts have been
	derived based upon our historical results and the pro forma
	adjustments for the Business Acquisitions and do not reflect the
	assumed acquisition by Carlyle Holdings of the additional
	allocations of carried interest in our carry funds that are
	currently held by our senior Carlyle professionals (see
	(3) below).





	 





	(2)






	Reflects an adjustment to record
	the change in the fair value of the liability associated with
	contingent consideration related to the ESG and Claren Road
	acquisitions that is payable to senior Carlyle professionals
	based on the fulfillment of performance conditions. These
	payments are not contingent upon the senior Carlyle professional
	being employed by Carlyle at the time that the performance
	conditions are met. Historically, the change in the fair value
	of this liability was recorded within members equity, as
	the amounts are obligations payable to senior Carlyle
	professionals. Following this offering, we intend to account for
	this liability in a manner similar to all other
	acquisition-related contingent consideration; the change in fair
	value of this liability will be recorded within other
	non-operating expenses. The fair value of the contingent
	consideration was based on probability-weighted discounted cash
	flow models.





	 





	(3)






	In order to better align the
	interests of our senior Carlyle professionals and the other
	individuals who manage our carry funds with our own interests
	and with those of the investors in these funds, such individuals
	are allocated directly a portion of the carried interest in our
	carry funds. Prior to the Reorganization, the level of such
	allocations vary by fund, but generally are at least 50% of the
	carried interests in the fund. As part of the Reorganization,
	there will be a reallocation of carried interest to senior
	Carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry
	funds, such that the allocation to these individuals will be
	approximately 45% of all carried interest on a blended average
	basis, with the exception of the Riverstone funds, where Carlyle
	will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are
	entitled under our arrangements for those funds. Our senior
	Carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry
	funds will contribute to Carlyle Holdings a portion of the
	equity interests they own in the general partners of our
	existing carry funds in exchange for an equivalent fair value of
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units. No compensation is
	associated with this exchange as the individuals are receiving
	an equivalent fair value of Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	for the fair value of the carried interest rights that they are
	contributing.





	 









	Historically, these allocations of
	carried interest were accounted for as performance fee
	compensation expense for our Carlyle employees and as
	distributions from members equity for our senior Carlyle
	professionals. This adjustment reduces the performance fee
	related compensation expense associated with the reallocation of
	carried interest. The amounts have been derived from our
	historical results.





	 









	Excluded from this pro forma
	adjustment is a nonrecurring charge of approximately
	$107.8 million. The fair value of the Carlyle Holdings
	interests issued in this transaction exceeds the carrying value
	of the compensation liability, resulting in a nonrecurring
	charge of $107.8 million associated with this transaction.





	 









	Subsequent to the completion of the
	Reorganization and this offering, we will account for the
	remaining equity interests that our senior Carlyle professionals
	and other individuals who manage our carry funds own in the
	general partners of our existing carry funds as performance fee
	compensation expense.

	Reflects the elimination of all interest expense and fair value
	adjustments associated with the subordinated loan payable to
	affiliate. In October 2011, the Parent Entities redeemed
	$250 million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated
	loan payable to affiliate. In March 2012, the Parent Entities
	redeemed the remaining $250 million aggregate principal
	amount of the subordinated loan payable to affiliate for
	$260 million. As a result of the redemptions in October
	2011 and March 2012, all of the subordinated notes have been
	fully redeemed. Accordingly, interest expense of
	$33.6 million and fair value adjustments of
	$28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
	have been eliminated from the condensed combined and
	consolidated pro forma statement of operations.




	 












	 


	    


	This adjustment also reflects pro forma interest expense of
	$10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011

	Groups existing senior secured credit facility totaling

	redemptions, at an average interest rate of 2.05%.




	 












	 


	(d) 


	We have historically operated as a group of partnerships for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes and, for certain entities
	located outside the United States, corporate entities for
	foreign income tax purposes. Because most of the entities in our
	consolidated group are pass-through entities for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, our profits and losses
	are generally allocated to the partners who are individually
	responsible for reporting such amounts and we are not taxed at
	the entity level. Based on applicable foreign, state, and local
	tax laws, we record a provision for income taxes for certain
	entities. Accordingly, the income tax provisions shown on
	Carlyle Groups historical combined and consolidated
	statement of operations of $28.5 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 primarily consisted of the District of
	Columbia and foreign corporate income taxes.




	 


	Following the transactions described under Organizational
	Structure and this offering, the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships and their subsidiaries will continue to operate as
	partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, for
	certain entities located outside the United States, corporate
	entities for foreign income tax purposes. Accordingly, several
	entities will continue to be subject to the District of Columbia
	franchise tax and the New York City unincorporated business
	income tax (UBT) and

	non-U.S. entities

	will continue to be subject to corporate income taxes in
	jurisdictions in which they operate in. In addition, certain
	newly formed wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	will be subject to entity-level corporate income taxes. As a
	result of our new corporate structure, we will record an
	additional provision for corporate income taxes that will
	reflect our current and deferred income tax liability relating
	to the taxable earnings allocated to such entities.

	(e) 


	Reflects the historical basis of partnership interests in
	subsidiaries of the Parent Entities that the existing owners are
	retaining. Certain retired senior Carlyle professionals will
	retain their interests in our carried interest entities. For
	these individuals, their carried interests rights will be
	restructured such that they will exchange their pre-existing
	carried interest rights (through their ownership interests in
	the Parent Entities) for an equivalent amount of carried
	interest rights directly in the consolidated general partners of
	our funds. Historically, these interests were reflected within
	members equity on the Carlyle Group balance
	sheet, as these interests existed through the individuals
	ownership interests in the Parent Entities, and the income
	attributable to these carried interests rights were included in
	net income attributable to Carlyle Group on the
	Carlyle Group statement of operations because their interests
	were part of the controlling interest in Carlyle Group. As their
	carried interest rights will no longer be held through a parent
	of Carlyle Group directly or indirectly after this exchange,
	this adjustment reclassifies the income attributable to those
	interests totaling $42.3 million as net income attributable
	to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities from net
	income attributable to Carlyle Group (see adjustment 2(f)). This
	amount was derived based on historical financial results as well
	as the ownership of the individuals.




	 


	Subsequent to the completion of the Reorganization, we will
	account for the carried interest rights allocated to retired
	senior Carlyle professionals as non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities.

	(1)






	As part of the Reorganization, our
	existing owners received 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units, of which 217,239,664 are vested and
	56,760,336 are unvested.





	 









	We intend to reflect the unvested
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units as compensation expense in
	accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,

	Compensation  Stock Compensation

	(ASC
	718). The unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units will
	be charged to expense as the Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	vest over the service period on a straight-line basis. See
	Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Carlyle Holdings Partnership
	Agreements. Amounts have been derived assuming a fair
	value of $22.00 per partnership unit (based on the initial
	public offering price per common unit in this offering),
	multiplied by the number of unvested units, expensed over the
	assumed service period of six years. Additionally, the
	calculation of the expense assumes a forfeiture rate of up to
	7.5%. This expense is derived from awards with a total service
	period of greater than five years of $192.5 million. The
	total compensation expense expected to be recognized in all
	future periods associated with the Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units, considering estimated forfeitures, is
	$1,155.0 million.





	 





	(2)






	At the time of the offering, we
	have granted deferred restricted common units of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. with an aggregate value based on the initial public
	offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately
	$376.5 million (17,113,755 deferred restricted common
	units) to our employees and directors who are not employees of
	or advisors to Carlyle. The deferred restricted common units are
	unvested when granted and will vest over a service period. The
	grant-date fair value of the units will be charged to
	compensation expense over the vesting period. The amount in the
	adjustment has been derived based on the offering price of
	$22.00 per unit, multiplied by the number of unvested units,
	expensed over the assumed service period, which ranges from one
	to six years. Additionally, the calculation of the expense
	assumes a forfeiture rate up to 15.0%. This expense is derived
	from awards with a total service period of five years or less of
	$5.1 million and a total service period of greater than
	five years of $55.5 million. The total compensation expense
	expected to be recognized in all future periods associated with
	the deferred restricted common units, considering estimated
	forfeitures, is $344.7 million.





	 





	(3)






	At the time of the offering, we
	have granted phantom deferred restricted common units to our
	employees with an aggregate value based on the initial public
	offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately
	$8.0 million (362,875 phantom deferred restricted common
	units). The phantom deferred restricted common units are
	unvested when granted and will vest over a service period. Upon
	vesting, the units will be settled in cash. Because the awards
	are subject to vesting, no liability will be recorded upon grant
	and thus no pro forma adjustment is reflected in our unaudited
	condensed combined and consolidated pro forma balance sheet. The
	fair value of the units will be re-measured each reporting
	period until settlement and charged to compensation expense over
	the vesting period. The amount in the adjustment has been
	derived based on the offering price of $22.00 per unit (the
	assumed initial fair value of the phantom deferred restricted
	common units), multiplied by the number of unvested units,
	expensed over the assumed service period of three years. No
	change to the fair value of the liability is assumed over the
	periods presented. Additionally, the calculation of the expense
	assumes a forfeiture rate of up to 15.0%. The total compensation
	expense expected to be recognized in all future periods
	associated with the phantom deferred restricted common units,
	considering estimated forfeitures, is $6.9 million.





	 












	 


	(b) 


	Reflects a reduction of pro forma interest expense of
	$14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
	associated with the assumed repayment using the proceeds of this
	offering of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the
	loans associated with the Claren Road acquisition of
	$40.0 million and $10.0 million at a fixed annual
	interest rate of 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and
	(ii) $570.9 million of the outstanding indebtedness
	under the revolving credit facility of Carlyle Groups
	existing senior secured credit facility at an assumed interest
	rate of 2.05%, representing the variable interest rate in effect
	on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2011
	(LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.75%). See
	Use of Proceeds.





	 












	4.  






	Adjustments
	for Non-Controlling Interests







	 












	 


	(a) 


	In order to reflect the Reorganization and offering transaction
	as if they occurred on January 1, 2011, an adjustment has
	been made to reflect the inclusion of non-controlling interests
	in consolidated entities representing Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units that are held by the existing owners after
	this offering. Such Carlyle Holdings partnership units represent
	90.0% of all Carlyle Holdings partnership units outstanding
	immediately following this offering.






	199








	 






	 



	In connection with the Reorganization, we have entered into an
	exchange agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships. Under the exchange agreement, subject to
	the applicable vesting and minimum retained ownership
	requirements and transfer restrictions, each holder of Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units (and certain transferees thereof),
	other than the subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P., may up to
	four times a year, from and after the first anniversary of the
	date of the closing of this offering (subject to the terms of
	the exchange agreement), exchange these partnership units for
	The Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale  Lock-Up
	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. Under the exchange
	agreement, to effect an exchange a holder of partnership units
	in Carlyle Holdings must simultaneously exchange one partnership
	unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. No such
	exchanges have been assumed for the periods presented in the
	calculation of the pro forma adjustment for non-controlling
	interests presented herein.

	(2)






	Included in dilutive
	weighted-average common units are contingently issuable Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units associated with the Claren Road
	acquisition. For purposes of determining the dilutive
	weighted-average common units, it is assumed that
	December 31, 2011 represents the end of the contingency
	period and the if-converted method is applied to the
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units issuable therefrom.

	In connection with the
	Reorganization, we have entered into an exchange agreement with
	the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Under
	the exchange agreement, subject to the applicable vesting and
	minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer
	restrictions, each holder of Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	(and certain transferees thereof), other than the subsidiaries
	of The Carlyle Group L.P., may up to four times a year, from and
	after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this
	offering (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement),
	exchange these partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P.
	common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in Common Units
	Eligible For Future

	Sale Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. Under the exchange
	agreement, to effect an exchange a holder of partnership units
	in Carlyle Holdings must simultaneously exchange one partnership
	unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships.





	 









	We apply the
	if-converted method to the vested Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units to determine the dilutive weighted-average
	common units outstanding. We apply the treasury stock method to
	our unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units and the
	if-converted method on the resulting number of
	additional Carlyle Holdings partnership units to determine the
	dilutive weighted-average common units represented by our
	unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units.





	 









	In computing the dilutive effect
	that the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units would
	have on earnings per common unit, we considered that net income
	available to holders of common units would increase due to the
	elimination of non-controlling interests in consolidated
	entities associated with the Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	(including any tax impact). Based on these calculations, the
	incremental 221,614,940 Carlyle Holdings partnership units were
	antidilutive, and therefore have been excluded.

	Economic
	Net Income, Fee Related Earnings and Distributable
	Earnings  Pro Forma




	 


	Economic net income (ENI) is a key performance
	benchmark used in our industry. ENI represents net income which
	excludes the impact of income taxes, acquisition-related items
	including amortization of acquired intangibles and contingent
	consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated
	with equity-based compensation that will be issued in
	conjunction with this offering or future acquisitions, corporate
	actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events. ENI is
	also presented on a basis that deconsolidates the Consolidated
	Funds. We believe the exclusion of these items provides
	investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating
	performance. ENI is evaluated regularly by management in making
	resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of
	our four segments and for compensation. We believe that
	reporting ENI is helpful to understanding our business and that
	investors should review the same supplemental financial measure
	that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This
	measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and
	not in lieu of income before taxes in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP. For a further discussion about ENI, see
	Note 14 to our combined and consolidated financial
	statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.


	 


	Distributable Earnings is an additional measure to assess
	performance and amounts potentially available for distribution
	from Carlyle Holdings to its equity holders. Distributable
	Earnings, which is a non-GAAP measure, is intended to show the
	amount of net realized earnings without the effects of
	consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. Distributable Earnings
	is total ENI less unrealized performance fees, unrealized
	investment income and the corresponding unrealized performance
	fee compensation expense.


	 


	Fee related earnings is a component of ENI and is used to
	measure our operating profitability exclusive of performance
	fees, investment income from investments in our funds and
	performance fee-related compensation. Accordingly, fee related
	earnings reflect the ability of the business to cover direct
	base compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other
	than performance fees. We use fee related earnings from
	operations to measure our profitability from fund management
	fees.


	 


	The following table is a reconciliation of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. consolidated pro forma income before provision for income
	taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011 to pro forma
	ENI, pro forma fee related earnings and pro forma distributable
	earnings for the comparable period (Dollars in millions):

	BUSINESS






	 




	Overview





	 


	We are one of the worlds largest and most diversified
	multi-product global alternative asset management firms. We
	advise an array of specialized investment funds and other
	investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries,
	geographies, asset classes and investment strategies and seek to
	deliver attractive returns for our fund investors. Since our
	firm was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1987, we have grown
	to become a leading global alternative asset manager with
	approximately $147 billion in AUM across 89 funds and
	52 fund of funds vehicles. We have approximately
	1,300 employees, including more than 600 investment
	professionals in 33 offices across six continents, and we
	serve over 1,400 active carry fund investors from
	72 countries. Across our Corporate Private Equity and Real
	Assets segments, we have investments in over 200 portfolio
	companies that employ more than 650,000 people.


	 





	 


	 


	The growth and development of our firm has been guided by
	several fundamental tenets:


	 












	 


	 



	Excellence in Investing.

	 Our primary goal is to
	invest wisely and create value for our fund investors. We strive
	to generate superior investment returns by combining deep
	industry expertise, a global network of local investment teams
	who can leverage extensive firm-wide resources and a consistent
	and disciplined investment process.




	 




	 


	 



	Commitment to our Fund Investors.

	 Our fund
	investors come first. This commitment is a core component of our
	firm culture and informs every aspect of our business. We
	believe this philosophy is in the long-term best interests of
	Carlyle and its owners, including our prospective common
	unitholders.




	 




	 


	 



	Investment in the Firm.

	 We have invested, and intend
	to continue to invest, significant resources in hiring and
	retaining a deep talent pool of investment professionals and in
	building the infrastructure of the firm, including our expansive
	local office network and our comprehensive investor support

	 



	Expansion of our Platform.

	  We innovate
	continuously to expand our investment capabilities through the
	creation or acquisition of new asset-, sector- and
	regional-focused strategies in order to provide our fund
	investors a variety of investment options.




	 




	 


	 



	Unified Culture.

	  We seek to leverage the local
	market insights and operational capabilities that we have
	developed across our global platform through a unified culture
	we call One Carlyle. Our culture emphasizes
	collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise across the
	firm to create value. We believe our collaborative approach
	enhances our ability to analyze investments, deploy capital and
	improve the performance of our portfolio companies.




	 


	We believe that this offering will enable us to continue to
	develop and grow our firm; strengthen our infrastructure; create
	attractive investment products, strategies and funds for the
	benefit of our fund investors; and attract and retain top
	quality professionals. We manage our business for the long-term,
	through economic cycles, leveraging investment and exit
	opportunities in different parts of the world and across asset
	classes, and believe it is an opportune time to capitalize on
	the additional resources and growth opportunities that a public
	offering will provide.



	 




	Competitive
	Strengths





	 


	Since our founding in 1987, Carlyle has grown to become one of
	the worlds largest and most diversified multi-product
	global alternative asset management firms. We believe that the
	following competitive strengths position us well for future
	growth:


	 




	Global Presence.


	  We believe we have a
	greater presence around the globe and in emerging markets than
	any other alternative asset manager. We currently operate on six
	continents and sponsor funds investing in the United States,
	Asia, Europe, Japan, MENA and South America with 12 carry funds
	and their related co-investment vehicles representing
	$11 billion in AUM actively investing in emerging markets.
	Our extensive network of investment professionals is composed
	primarily of local individuals with the knowledge, experience
	and relationships that allow them to identify and take advantage
	of opportunities unavailable to firms with less extensive
	footprints.


	 


	The following chart presents our investment professionals by
	region as of December 31, 2011.


	 





	 




	Diversified and Scalable Multi-Product
	Platform.


	  We have created separate
	geographic, sector and asset specific fund groups, investing
	significant resources to develop this extensive network of
	investment professionals and offices. As a result, we benefit
	from having 89 different funds (including 49 carry funds)
	and 52 fund of funds vehicles around the world. We believe this
	broad fund platform and our investor services infrastructure
	provide us with a scalable foundation to pursue future
	investment opportunities in high-growth markets, raise follow-on
	investment funds for existing products and integrate new
	products into our platform. Our diverse platform also enhances
	our resilience to credit market turmoil by enabling us to invest
	during such times in assets and geographies that are less
	dependent on leverage than traditional U.S. buyout
	activity. We believe the breadth of our product offerings also
	enhances our fundraising by allowing us to offer investors
	greater flexibility to allocate capital across different
	geographies, industries and components of a companys
	capital structure.

	The following charts present our AUM by segment and region as of
	December 31, 2011.


	 





	 




	Focus on Innovation.


	  We have been at
	the forefront of many recognized trends within our industry,
	including the diversification of investment products and asset
	classes, geographic expansion and raising strategic capital from
	institutional investors. Within 10 years of the launch of
	our first fund in 1990 to pursue buyout opportunities in the
	United States, we had expanded our buyout operations to Asia and
	Europe and added funds focused on U.S. real estate, global
	energy and power, structured credit, and venture and growth
	capital opportunities in Asia, Europe and the United States.
	Over the next 10 years, we developed an increasing number
	of new, diverse products, including funds focused on distressed
	opportunities, infrastructure, global financial services,
	mezzanine investments and real estate across Asia and Europe. We
	have continued to innovate in 2010 and 2011 with the
	establishment of the first foreign-funded domestic RMB equity
	investment partnership enterprise in China, the first investment
	vehicle under the new funds regime of the Dubai International
	Financial Centre and the formation of our energy mezzanine and
	U.S. equity opportunities funds. More recently, we
	established our Fund of Funds Solutions business with our July
	2011 acquisition of a 60% equity interest in AlpInvest and
	opened two new offices in

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa. We have also significantly expanded our Global Market
	Strategies business, which has more than doubled its AUM since
	the beginning of 2008, by adding stakes in long/short credit and
	emerging markets equities and macroeconomic strategies hedge
	funds with the respective acquisitions of Claren Road and ESG,
	launching a new energy mezzanine opportunities fund, and
	substantially expanding our structured credit platform with the
	acquisition of CLO management contracts with approximately $6
	billion in assets at the time of acquisition. We believe our
	focus on innovation will enable us to continue to identify and
	capitalize on new opportunities in high-growth geographies and
	sectors.


	 




	Proven Ability to Consistently Attract Capital from a
	High-Quality, Loyal Investor Base.


	  Since
	inception, we have raised approximately $117 billion in
	capital (excluding acquisitions). We have successfully and
	repeatedly raised long-term, non-redeemable capital commitments
	to new and successor funds, with a broad and diverse base of
	over 1,400 active carry fund investors from 72 countries.
	Despite the recent challenges in the fundraising markets, from
	December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2011, we had
	closings for commitments totaling approximately $32 billion
	across 30 funds and related co-investment vehicles, as well
	as net inflows to our hedge funds. We have a demonstrated
	history of attracting investors to multiple funds, with
	approximately 91% of commitments to our active carry funds (by
	dollar amount) coming from investors who are committed to more
	than one active carry fund, and approximately 58% of commitments
	to our active carry funds (by dollar amount) coming from
	investors who are committed to more than five active carry funds
	(each as of December 31, 2011). Over the past five years,
	our base of active carry fund investors has grown from
	approximately 1,000 to over 1,400. In addition, the number of
	large active carry fund investors, those with at least
	$100 million in committed capital, has grown approximately
	75% from 2006 to December 31, 2011. Moreover, we have also
	seen growth in our high net worth investor base. Our total
	active high net worth limited partner investor base has grown
	44% from 2006 to December 31, 2011. We have a dedicated
	in-house fund investor relations function, which we refer
	to





	206








	 






	 



	as our LP relations group, which includes
	23 geographically focused investor relations professionals
	and 31 product and client segment specialists and support
	staff operating on a global basis. Since the early 1990s, we
	have conducted our investor reporting and investor relations
	functions in-house to develop and maintain strong and
	interactive channels of communication with our fund investors
	and gain constant and timely insights into their needs and
	investment objectives. We believe that our constant dialogue
	with our fund investors and our commitment to providing them
	with the highest quality service inspires loyalty and aids our
	efforts to continue to attract investors across our investment
	platform.


	 




	Demonstrated Record of Investment
	Performance.


	  We have demonstrated a strong
	and consistent investment track record, producing attractive
	returns for our fund investors across segments, sectors and
	geographies, and across economic cycles. The following table
	summarizes the aggregate investment performance of our Corporate
	Private Equity and Real Assets segments. Due to the diversified
	nature of the strategies in our Global Market Strategies
	segment, we have included summarized investment performance for
	the largest carry fund and largest hedge fund in this segment.

	other Global Market Strategies funds, see

	An investment is considered
	realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and
	ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is
	considered partially realized when the total proceeds received
	in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or
	other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at
	least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet
	fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy
	involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information
	regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when
	considered together with the other investment performance
	metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful
	information regarding our investment performance by removing the
	impact of investments where significant realization activity has
	not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR
	have limitations as measures of investment performance, and
	should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include
	the fact that these measures do not include the performance of
	earlier stage and








	207








	 






	 


















	other investments that do not
	satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such
	investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially
	Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross
	IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate
	MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially
	Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of
	other companies that use similarly titled measures.

	Gross Internal Rate of Return
	(IRR) represents the annualized IRR for the period

	Net Annualized Return is presented
	for fee-paying investors on a total return basis, net of all
	fees and expenses.





	 





	(8)






	Due to the disparate nature of the
	underlying asset classes in which our Global Market Strategies
	funds participate (e.g., syndicated loans, bonds, distressed
	securities, mezzanine loans, emerging markets equities,
	macroeconomic products) and the inherent difficulties in
	aggregating the performance of closed-end and open-end funds,
	the presentation of aggregate investment performance across this
	segment would not be meaningful.





	 




	Financial Strength.


	  The investment
	performance across our broad fund base has enabled us to
	generate Economic Net Income of $833.1 million in 2011 and
	$1.014 billion in 2010 and Distributable Earnings of $864.4
	million and $342.5 million over the same periods. Our income
	before provision for income taxes, a GAAP measure, was
	approximately $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.5 billion in
	2010. This performance is also reflected in the rate of
	appreciation of the investments in our carry funds in recent
	periods, with a 34% increase in our carry fund value in 2010 and
	a 16% increase in 2011. Additionally, distributions to our fund
	investors have been robust, with more than $8 billion
	distributed to fund investors in 2010 and approximately
	$19 billion in 2011. We believe the investment pace and
	available capital of our carry funds position us well for the
	future. Our carry funds invested approximately $10 billion
	in 2010 and more than $11 billion in 2011. As of
	December 31, 2011, these funds had approximately
	$22 billion in capital commitments that had not yet been
	invested.

	capital by and total annual distributions from our carry funds

	Stable and Diverse Team of Talented Investment
	Professionals With a Strong Alignment of
	Interests


	.  We have a talented team of more
	than 600 investment professionals and we are assisted by our
	Executive Operations Group of 27 operating executives with an
	average of over 40 years of relevant operating, financial
	and regulatory experience, who are a valuable resource to our
	portfolio companies and our firm. Our investment professionals
	are supported by a centralized investor services and support
	group, which includes more than 400 professionals. The interests
	of our professionals are aligned with the interests of the
	investors in our funds and in our firm. Since our inception
	through December 31, 2011, we and our senior Carlyle
	professionals, operating executives and other professionals have
	invested or committed to invest in excess of $4 billion in
	or alongside





	208








	 






	 



	our funds. We have also sought to align the long-term incentives
	of our senior Carlyle professionals with our common unitholders,
	including through equity compensation arrangements that include
	certain vesting, minimum retained ownership and transfer
	restrictions. See Management  Vesting; Minimum
	Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer Restrictions.


	 




	Commitment to Responsible Global
	Citizenship.


	  We believe that being a good
	corporate citizen is part of good business practice and creates
	long-term value for our fund investors. We have worked to apply
	the Private Equity Growth Capital Councils Guidelines for
	Responsible Investment, which we helped to develop in 2008,
	demonstrating our commitment to environmental, social and
	governance standards in our investment activities. In addition,
	we were the first global alternative asset management firm to
	release a corporate citizenship report, which catalogues and
	describes our corporate citizenship efforts, including our
	responsible investment policy and practices and those of our
	portfolio companies. We have been a strong supporter of the
	Robert Toigo Foundation and have also established a working
	relationship with the Environmental Defense Fund through which
	we jointly developed the alternative asset management
	sectors first environmental management business review
	process.



	 




	Our
	Strategy for the Future





	 


	We intend to create value for our common unitholders by seeking
	to:


	 












	 


	 


	continue to generate attractive investment returns for our fund
	investors across our

	multi-fund,

	multi-product global investment platform, including by
	increasing the value of our current portfolio and leveraging the
	strong capital position of our investment funds to pursue new
	investment opportunities;




	 




	 


	 


	continue to inspire the confidence and loyalty of our more than
	1,400 active carry fund investors, and further expand our
	investor base, with a focus on client service and strong
	investment performance;




	 




	 


	 


	continue to grow our AUM by raising follow-on investment funds
	across our four segments and by broadening our platform through
	both organic growth and selective acquisitions, where we believe
	we can provide investors with differentiated products to meet
	their needs;




	 




	 


	 


	further advance our leadership position in core

	non-U.S. geographic

	markets, including

	high-growth

	emerging markets such as China, Latin America, India, MENA and

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa; and




	 




	 


	 


	continue to demonstrate principled industry leadership and be a
	responsible and respected member of the global community by
	demonstrating our commitment to environmental, social and
	governance standards in our investment activities.





	 




	Business
	Segments





	 


	We operate our business across four segments: (1) Corporate
	Private Equity, (2) Real Assets, (3) Global Market
	Strategies and (4) Fund of Funds Solutions. We established
	our Fund of Funds Solutions segment on July 1, 2011 at the
	time we completed our acquisition of a 60% equity interest in,
	and began to consolidate, AlpInvest.


	 





	Corporate
	Private Equity





	 


	Our Corporate Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with
	our first U.S. buyout fund, advises our buyout and growth
	capital funds, which pursue a wide variety of corporate
	investments of different sizes and growth potentials. Our
	26 active Corporate Private Equity funds are each carry
	funds. They are organized and operated by geography or industry
	and are advised by separate teams of local professionals who
	live and work in the markets where they invest. We believe this





	209








	 






	 



	diversity of funds allows us to deploy more targeted and
	specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our
	fund investors the ability to tailor their investment choices.


	 


	Our Corporate Private Equity teams have two primary areas of
	focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Buyout Funds.

	  Our buyout teams advise a
	diverse group of 17 active funds that invest in transactions
	that focus either on a particular geography (United States,
	Europe, Asia, Japan, South America or MENA) or a particular
	industry (e.g., financial services). In addition, we continually
	seek to expand and diversify our buyout portfolio into new areas
	where we see opportunity for future growth. In 2010, we launched
	a new operation to target opportunities in middle-market private
	equity in North America across the nine industry sectors of our
	Corporate Private Equity business. In early 2011, we formed a
	team to focus on the emerging market of

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa. As of December 31, 2011, our buyout funds had, in
	the aggregate, approximately $47 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Growth Capital Funds.

	  Our nine active
	growth capital funds are advised by three

	regionally-focused

	teams in the United States, Europe and Asia, with each team
	generally focused on middle-market and growth companies
	consistent with specific regional investment considerations. The
	investment mandate for our growth capital funds is to seek out
	companies with the potential for growth, strategic redirection
	and operational improvements. These funds typically do not
	invest in early stage or venture-type investments. As of
	December 31, 2011, our growth capital funds had, in the
	aggregate, approximately $4 billion in AUM.




	 


	The chart below presents the cumulative equity invested since
	inception by industry for our Corporate Private Equity funds as
	of December 31, 2011 (dollar amounts in chart in millions).


	 





	 


	From inception through December 31, 2011, we have invested
	approximately $49 billion in 422 transactions. Of that
	total, we have invested 58% in 212 transactions in North and
	South America, 23% in 95 transactions in Europe and MENA and 19%
	in 115 transactions in the Asia-Pacific region. We have fully
	realized 255 of these investments, meaning our funds have
	completely exited, and no longer own an interest in, those
	investments.

	Real
	Assets





	 


	Our Real Assets segment, established in 1997 with our first
	U.S. real estate fund, advises our 17 active carry
	funds focused on real estate, infrastructure and energy and
	renewable resources. This business pursues investment
	opportunities across a diverse array of tangible assets, such as
	office buildings, apartments, hotels, retail properties,
	senior-living facilities, pipelines, wind farms, refineries,
	airports, roads and other similar assets, as well as the
	companies providing services to them.


	 


	The following chart presents the AUM by asset class of our Real
	Assets segment as of December 31, 2011.


	 





	 


	Our Real Assets teams have three primary areas of focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Real Estate.

	  Our 10 active real estate funds
	pursue real estate investment opportunities in Asia, Europe and
	the United States and generally focus on acquiring
	single-property opportunities rather than large-cap companies
	with real estate portfolios. Our team of more than 120 real
	estate investment professionals has made approximately 475
	investments in over 120 cities/metropolitan statistical
	areas around the world as of December 31, 2011, including
	office buildings, hotels, retail properties, residential
	properties, industrial properties and senior living facilities.
	As of December 31, 2011, our real estate funds had, in the
	aggregate, approximately $12 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Infrastructure.

	  Our infrastructure investment
	team focuses on investments in infrastructure companies and
	assets. The team comprises 10 investment professionals and works
	in conjunction with the public sector to find cooperative
	methods of managing and investing in infrastructure assets. As
	of December 31, 2011, we advised one infrastructure fund
	with approximately $1 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Energy & Renewable Resources.

	  Our
	energy and renewable resources activities focus on buyouts,
	growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the
	midstream, upstream, power and oilfield services sectors, as
	well as the renewable and alternative sectors of the energy
	industry. We currently conduct these activities with Riverstone,
	jointly advising six funds with approximately $17 billion
	in AUM as of December 31, 2011. We and Riverstone have
	mutually decided not to pursue additional jointly managed funds
	(although we will continue to advise jointly with Riverstone the
	six existing energy and renewable resources funds). We are
	actively







	211








	 






	 













	 




	exploring new approaches through which to expand our energy
	capabilities and intend to augment our significant in-house
	expertise in this sector.




	 


	Our Real Assets funds, including Carlyle-advised co-investment
	vehicles, have through December 31, 2011, invested on a
	global basis more than $26 billion in a total of 552
	investments (including more than 60 portfolio companies).
	Of that total, we have invested 77% in 413 investments in North
	and South America, 19% in 104 investments in Europe and MENA and
	4% in 35 investments in the Asia-Pacific region.


	 


	The following table presents certain data about our Real Assets
	segment as of December 31, 2011 (dollar amounts in
	billions; compound annual growth is presented since
	December 31, 2003; amounts invested include co-investments;
	investment professionals excludes Riverstone employees).

	Global
	Market Strategies





	 


	Our Global Market Strategies segment, established in 1999 with
	our first high yield fund, advises a group of 46 active funds
	that pursue investment opportunities across various types of
	credit, equities and alternative instruments, including bank
	loans, high yield debt, structured credit products, distressed
	debt, corporate mezzanine, energy mezzanine opportunities and
	long/short high-grade and high-yield credit instruments,
	emerging markets equities, and (with regards to certain
	macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities and interest
	rate products and their derivatives.


	 


	The following chart presents the AUM by asset class of our
	Global Market Strategies segment as of December 31, 2011.


	 





	 


	Primary areas of focus for our Global Market Strategies teams
	include:


	 












	 


	 



	Structured Credit Funds.

	  Our structured credit
	funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans
	through structured vehicles and other investment vehicles. In
	2011, we acquired Churchill Financial, the collateral manager
	for a CLO with $1.25 billion in commitments that invests in
	performing senior loans to middle-market companies, to augment
	the product breadth of our platform. In 2010, we acquired CLO
	management contracts from Mizuho Alternative Investments LLC and
	Stanfield Capital Partners LLC aggregating approximately
	$5 billion of AUM. As of December 31, 2011, our
	structured credit team advised 32 collateral loan funds in the
	United States and Europe totaling, in the aggregate,
	approximately $13 billion in AUM.






	212








	 






	 



	 












	 


	 



	Distressed and Corporate Opportunities.

	  Our
	distressed and corporate opportunities funds generally invest in
	liquid and illiquid securities and obligations, including
	secured debt, senior and subordinated unsecured debt,
	convertible debt obligations, preferred stock and public and
	private equity of financially distressed companies in defensive
	and asset-rich industries. In certain investments, our funds may
	seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into
	controlling positions in the equity of reorganized companies. As
	of December 31, 2011, our distressed and corporate
	opportunities team advised three funds, totaling in the
	aggregate, approximately $2 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Corporate Mezzanine.

	  Our corporate mezzanine
	investment team advises funds that invest in mezzanine loans of
	middle-market companies, typically defined as companies with
	annual EBITDA ranging from $10 million to $50 million
	that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond
	markets. Our corporate mezzanine business focuses on leveraged
	buyouts, recapitalizations, acquisitions and growth financings.
	As of December 31, 2011, our corporate mezzanine team
	advised two funds totaling, in the aggregate, approximately
	$700 million in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Energy Mezzanine Opportunities.

	  Our energy
	mezzanine opportunities team was organized in 2010 and advises a
	fund that invests primarily in privately negotiated mezzanine
	debt investments in North American energy and power projects and
	companies. As of December 31, 2011, our energy mezzanine
	opportunities team advised one fund with approximately
	$400 million in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Long/Short Credit.

	  On December 31, 2010,
	we acquired a 55% stake in Claren Road Asset Management, LLC
	(Claren Road). As of December 31, 2011, Claren
	Road advised two long/short credit hedge funds focusing on the
	global high grade and high yield markets totaling, in the
	aggregate, approximately $6 billion in AUM. Claren Road
	seeks to profit from market mispricing of long

	and/or

	short
	positions in corporate bonds and loans, and their derivatives,
	across investment grade, high yield, or distressed companies.




	 




	 


	 



	Emerging Market Equity and Macroeconomic
	Strategies.

	  On July 1, 2011, we acquired a
	55% stake in Emerging Sovereign Group LLC (ESG). ESG
	advises six emerging markets equities and macroeconomic hedge
	funds with approximately $2 billion of AUM. ESGs
	emerging markets equities funds invest in publicly-traded
	equities across a range of developing countries. ESGs
	macroeconomic funds pursue investment strategies in developed
	and developing countries, and opportunities resulting from
	changes in the global economic environment.

	Fund
	of Funds Solutions





	 


	Our Fund of Funds Solutions segment was established on
	July 1, 2011 when we completed our acquisition of a 60%
	equity interest in AlpInvest. AlpInvest is one of the
	worlds largest investors in private equity and advises a
	global private equity fund of funds program and related
	co-investment and secondary activities. Its anchor clients are
	two large Dutch pension funds, which were the founders and
	previous shareholders of the company.




	213








	 






	 



	The following chart presents the AUM by asset class of our Fund
	of Funds Solutions segment as of December 31, 2011.


	 





	 


	 


	AlpInvest has three primary areas of focus:


	 












	 


	 



	Fund Investments.

	  AlpInvest fund of funds
	vehicles make investment commitments directly to buyout, growth
	capital, venture and other alternative asset funds advised by
	other general partners (portfolio funds). As of
	December 31, 2011, AlpInvest advised 25 fund of funds
	vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, approximately
	$30 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Co-investments.

	  AlpInvest invests alongside
	other private equity and mezzanine funds in which it has a fund
	investment throughout Europe, North America and Asia (for
	example, when an investment opportunity is too large for a
	particular fund, the adviser of the fund may seek to raise
	additional co-investment capital from sources such
	as AlpInvest for that one large transaction). As of
	December 31, 2011, AlpInvest co-investments programs were
	conducted through 15 fund of funds vehicles totaling, in the
	aggregate, approximately $5 billion in AUM.




	 




	 


	 



	Secondary Investments.

	  AlpInvest also advises
	funds that acquire interests in portfolio funds in secondary
	market transactions. Private equity investors who desire to sell
	or restructure their pre-existing investment commitments to a
	fund may negotiate to sell the fund interests to AlpInvest. In
	this manner, AlpInvests secondary investments team
	provides liquidity and restructuring alternatives for
	third-party private equity investors. As of December 31,
	2011, AlpInvests secondary investments program was
	conducted through 12 fund of funds vehicles totaling, in
	the aggregate, approximately $6 billion in AUM.




	 


	In July 2011, AlpInvest was awarded a private equity investment
	mandate by the Municipal Employee Retirement System of Michigan
	(MERS), pursuant to which MERS will commit
	$500 million over the next five years. In January 2012,
	Alpinvest was awarded a private equity investment mandate by a
	United States Corporate Trust, pursuant to which the United
	States Corporate Trust will commit $300 million over the next
	three years. Although separate accounts and co-mingled vehicles
	for clients other than AlpInvests anchor clients do not
	currently represent a significant portion of our AUM, we expect
	to grow our Fund of Funds Solutions segment with these products.


	 


	The following table presents certain data about our Fund of
	Funds Solutions segment as of December 31, 2011 (dollar
	amounts in billions). See  Structure and
	Operation of Our Investment Funds  Incentive
	Arrangements/Fee Structure for a discussion of the
	arrangements with the historical owners and management of

	Investment
	Approach





	 





	Corporate
	Private Equity





	 


	The investment approach of our private equity teams is generally
	characterized as follows:


	 












	 


	 



	Consistent and Disciplined Investment
	Process.

	  We believe our successful investment
	track record is the result in part of a consistent and
	disciplined application of our investment process. Investment
	opportunities for our Corporate Private Equity funds are
	initially sourced and evaluated by one or more of our deal
	teams. Each investment opportunity of our private equity funds
	must first pass an approval process that involves initial
	approvals from a fund head (or co-fund heads), interim update
	meetings that frequently include operating executives as well as
	our Chief Investment Officer, William E. Conway, Jr., and a
	due diligence review. Our due diligence approach typically
	incorporates meetings with management, company facility visits,
	discussions with industry analysts and consultants and an
	in-depth examination of financial results and projections. This
	transaction review process places a special emphasis on, among
	other considerations, the reputation of a target companys
	shareholders and management, the companys size and
	sensitivity of cash flow generation, the business sector and
	competitive risks, the portfolio fit, exit risks and other key
	factors highlighted by the deal team. An investment opportunity
	must secure final approval from the investment committee of the
	applicable investment fund. The investment committee approval
	process involves a detailed overview of the transaction and
	investment thesis, business, risk factors and diligence issues,
	as well as financial models.




	 




	 


	 



	Industry-Focused.

	  We have adopted an
	industry-focused approach to investing. We have particular
	industry expertise in aerospace, defense and government
	services, consumer and retail, financial services, healthcare,
	industrial, technology and business services, telecommunications
	and media and transportation. As a result, we believe that our
	in-depth knowledge of specific industries improves our ability
	to source and create transactions, conduct effective and more
	informed due diligence, develop strong relationships with
	management teams and use contacts and relationships within such
	industries to identify potential buyers as part of a coherent
	exit strategy. As the firm has expanded to include teams in
	Europe, Asia, Japan, South America,

	Sub-Saharan

	Africa and MENA, the industry groups have also grown and reach
	across even more geographies, disciplines and funds.




	 




	 


	 



	Variable Deal Sizes.

	  Our teams are staffed not
	only to effectively pursue large transactions, but also other
	transactions of varying sizes. We often invest in smaller
	companies and this has allowed us to obtain greater diversity
	across our entire portfolio. On an overall basis, we believe
	that having the resources to complete investments of varying
	sizes provides our funds







	215








	 






	 













	 




	with the ability to enhance their investment returns while
	providing for prudent industry, geographic and size
	diversification.




	 












	 


	 



	Control and Influence Oriented.

	  Our Corporate
	Private Equity funds, other than our growth funds and our funds
	focused on emerging markets, typically acquire, either alone or
	as part of a consortium, control of companies in leveraged
	buyout transactions. Additionally, we seek to obtain board
	representation and typically appoint our investment
	professionals and operating executives to represent us on the
	board of a company in which we invest. Where our funds, either
	alone or as part of a consortium, are not the controlling
	investor, we typically, subject to applicable regulatory
	requirements, acquire significant voting and other rights with a
	view to securing influence over conduct of the business.




	 




	 


	 



	Driving Value Creation.

	  Our Corporate Private
	Equity teams seek to make investments in portfolio companies in
	which our particular strengths and resources, including industry
	expertise, extensive local presence across the globe and deep
	business relationships, may be employed to their best advantage.
	Typically, as part of a Corporate Private Equity investment,
	Carlyles investment teams will develop and execute a
	customized, value creation thesis that underpins the projected
	investment return for the company. The value creation plan is
	developed during a thorough due diligence effort and draws on
	the deep resources available across our global platform,
	specifically relying on:




	 












	 


	 



	Reach:

	  Our global team and global presence
	that enables us to support international expansion efforts and
	global supply chain initiatives.




	 




	 


	 



	Expertise:

	  Our investment professionals and
	our specialists dedicated to nine industry sectors, who provide
	extensive sector-specific knowledge and local market expertise.




	 




	 


	 



	Insight:

	  Our 27 operating executives,
	primarily deeply experienced former CEOs, who work with our
	investment teams during due diligence, provide board-level
	governance and support and advise our portfolio company CEOs and
	our extensive pool of consultants and advisors who provide
	specialist expertise to support specific value creation
	initiatives.




	 




	 


	 



	Data:

	  Our investment portfolio, which includes
	over 200 active portfolio companies that range across diverse
	industries, geographies, asset classes and investment
	strategies, serves as an economic leading indicator and provides
	us with advanced market intelligence.




	 


	A value creation thesis typically focuses on a combination of
	(i) international expansion through organic initiatives and
	acquisitions; (ii) operational improvements, which often
	include supply chain efficiencies, lean process improvements and
	Six Sigma initiatives; (iii) business growth
	initiatives via new product launches, R&D efforts, as well
	as acquisitions or new-market entrance; and (iv) supporting
	and supplementing senior management capabilities with our broad
	network and organized global CEO forums. Progress against the
	initial investment thesis is reviewed each quarter by our
	founders, sector vice-chairmen and other senior investment
	professionals as part of our quarterly portfolio reviews and
	quarterly valuation processes.


	 












	 


	 



	Pursuing Best Exit Alternatives.

	  In
	determining when to exit an investment, our private equity teams
	consider whether a portfolio company has achieved its
	objectives, the financial returns and the appropriate timing in
	industry cycles and company development to strive for the
	optimal value. Senior members of the funds investment
	committee must approve all exit decisions. From inception
	through December 31, 2011, our Corporate Private Equity
	funds have invested approximately $49 billion in 422
	transactions, and we have fully realized 255 of these
	investments.






	216








	 






	 



	 





	Real
	Assets





	 


	Our Real Assets business includes investments in the energy and
	renewable resources sectors and in infrastructure assets,
	companies and projects as well as our real estate investments.
	The investment approach of the teams advising the energy and
	renewable resources and infrastructure funds is similar to that
	of our Corporate Private Equity funds, with certain additional
	objectives. For example, our infrastructure investment team
	pursues partnerships with public and private operators of
	infrastructure assets which seek to generate stable, long-term
	returns. With Riverstone, we have often pursued investments in
	buyout, growth capital and strategic joint ventures with
	management teams seeking to build companies in the energy and
	renewable resources sector.


	 


	The investment approach of our real estate teams is generally
	characterized as follows:


	 












	 


	 



	Pursue an Opportunistic Strategy.

	  In general,
	our real estate funds have focused on single asset transactions,
	using an opportunistic real estate investment strategy. We
	follow this approach because we believe that pursuing single
	assets enables us to better underwrite the factors that
	contribute to the fundamental value of each property; mitigate
	concentration risk; establish appropriate

	asset-by-asset

	capital structures; and maintain governance over major
	property-level decisions. In addition, direct ownership of
	assets typically enables us to effectively employ an active
	asset management approach and reduce financing and operating
	risk, while increasing the visibility of factors that affect the
	overall returns of the investment. We evaluate the risk and
	return factors that are inherent in each specific property
	situation. We believe we have an in-depth understanding of the
	key factors affecting real property markets, flows of domestic
	and cross-border capital and macroeconomic trends, which allow
	us to identify, analyze and evaluate potential investments
	quickly and creatively, often in connection with complex
	transactions.




	 




	 


	 



	Seek out Strong Joint Venture Partners or
	Managers.

	  Where appropriate, we seek out joint
	venture partners or managers with significant operational
	expertise. For each joint venture, we design structures and
	terms that provide situationally appropriate incentives, often
	including, for example, the subordination of the joint venture
	partners equity and profits interest to that of a fund,
	claw back provisions

	and/or

	profits escrow accounts in favor of a fund, and exclusivity. We
	also typically structure positions with control or veto rights
	over major decisions.




	 




	 


	 



	Source Deals Directly.

	  Our teams endeavor to
	establish market presence in our target geographies
	where we have a history of operating in our local markets and
	benefit from extensive long-term relationships with developers,
	corporate real estate owners, institutional investors and
	private owners. Such relationships have resulted in our ability
	to source investments on a direct negotiated basis. We generally
	seek to avoid situations in which there are a large number of
	competitive bidders and prioritize situations that offer the
	opportunity to negotiate with owners directly in non-bid
	processes.




	 




	 


	 



	Focus on Sector-Specific Strategies.

	  Our real
	estate funds focus on specific sectors and markets in areas
	where we believe the fundamentals are sound and dynamic capital
	markets allow for identification of assets whose value is not
	fully recognized. The real estate funds we advise have invested
	according to strategies established in several main sectors:
	office, hotel, retail, industrial, for-sale residential,
	apartment and senior living.




	 




	 


	 



	Actively Manage our Real Estate
	Investments.

	  Our real estate investments often
	require active management to uncover and create value.
	Accordingly, we have put in place experienced local asset
	management teams. These teams add value through analysis and
	execution of capital expenditure programs, development projects,
	lease negotiations, operating cost reduction programs and asset
	dispositions. The asset management teams work closely with the
	other real estate professionals to effectively formulate and
	implement strategic management plans.






	217








	 






	 



	 












	 


	 



	Manage the Exit of Investments.

	  We believe
	that exit management is as important as traditional
	asset management in order to take full advantage of the
	typically short windows of opportunity created by temporary
	imbalances in capital market forces that affect real estate. In
	determining when to exit an investment, our real estate teams
	consider whether an investment has fulfilled its strategic plan,
	the depth of the market and generally prevailing industry
	conditions.




	 


	From inception through December 31, 2011, our Real Assets
	funds have invested more than $26 billion in 552
	transactions, and we have fully realized 222 of these
	investments.


	 





	Global
	Market Strategies





	 


	The investment approach of our Global Market Strategies carry
	funds is generally characterized as follows:


	 












	 


	 



	Source Investment Opportunities.

	  Our Global
	Market Strategies teams source investment opportunities through
	our global network and strong relationships with the financial
	community. The teams source assets from both the primary and
	secondary markets. All of our closed-end Global Market
	Strategies funds focus on sourcing investment opportunities that
	are consistent with their respective return objectives. We
	typically target portfolio companies that have a demonstrated
	track record of profitability, market leadership in their
	respective niche, predictability of cash flow, a definable
	competitive advantage and products or services that are value
	added to its customer base.




	 




	 


	 



	Conduct Fundamental Due Diligence and Perform Capital
	Structure Analysis

	. After an opportunity is identified, our
	Global Market Strategies teams conduct fundamental due diligence
	to determine the relative value of the potential investment and
	capital structure analyses to determine the credit worthiness.
	Our due diligence approach typically incorporates meetings with
	management, company facility visits, discussions with industry
	analysts and consultants and an in-depth examination of
	financial results and projections. Our structured credit team
	adheres to strict credit approval processes to ensure that every
	investment brought into a funds portfolio is first
	reviewed by experienced senior investment professionals and then
	presented to a credit committee, which approves or declines the
	investment.




	 




	 


	 



	Evaluation of Macroeconomic Factors.

	  Our
	Global Market Strategies teams evaluate technical factors such
	as supply and demand, the markets expectations surrounding
	an issuer and the existence of short- and long-term value
	creation or destruction catalysts. Inherent in all stages of
	credit evaluation is a determination of the likelihood of
	potential catalysts emerging, such as corporate reorganizations,
	recapitalizations, asset sales, changes in a companys
	liquidity and mergers and acquisitions. Our Global Market
	Strategies teams constantly evaluate the overall investment
	climate given their assessment of the economic outlook, changes
	in industry fundamentals, market changes, redemption risk,
	financial market liquidity and valuation levels.




	 




	 


	 



	Risk Minimization.

	  Our Global Market
	Strategies teams seek to make investments in capital structures
	to enable companies to both expand and weather downturns

	and/or

	below-plan performance. Our Global Market Strategies teams seek
	to structure investments with strong financial covenants,
	frequent reporting requirements and board representation if
	possible. Through board observation rights or a board seat, our
	Global Market Strategies teams have historically provided a
	consultative, interactive approach to equity sponsors and
	management partners as part of the overall portfolio management
	process.




	 


	The investment approach of our Global Market Strategies hedge
	funds is generally characterized as follows:


	 












	 


	 



	Premium on Liquidity.

	  Our hedge funds
	generally run liquid portfolios that place an emphasis on
	maintaining tradable assets in their respective funds.
	Additionally, they generally employ long and short positions and
	construct their portfolios to produce returns absent broad
	market movements.






	218








	 






	 



	 












	 


	 



	Unique, Actionable Idea Generation.

	  The public
	markets are thoroughly analyzed by the numerous competitors in
	asset management. However, due to technical factors or general
	investor sentiment, securities can become over or undervalued
	quickly relative to their intrinsic value. Our hedge fund
	managers separate their research teams into industry and
	geography specific analysts in order to develop in-depth
	coverage on companies and sectors to generate proprietary
	research with actionable alpha-generating ideas as prices evolve.




	 




	 


	 



	Strong Risk Management Oversight.

	  A
	well-controlled risk profile is an important part of our Global
	Market Strategies investment methodology. Our risk officers
	constantly assess the portfolios of our hedge funds in light of
	market movements. In addition, Global Market Strategies has a
	separate team which has developed a rigorous risk management
	system whereby we analyze the concentration risk, liquidity
	risk, historical scenario risk analysis, counterparty risk and
	value at risk of our various funds on a daily basis.




	 





	Fund
	of Funds Solutions





	 


	The investment approach of AlpInvests teams is generally
	characterized as follows:


	 












	 


	 



	Depth of Investment Expertise.

	  AlpInvest has
	dedicated teams for each area of focus, allowing it to attract
	and retain talent with the required skill-set for each strategy.
	AlpInvest professionals have trading, operational, portfolio and
	risk management expertise. From a

	top-down

	perspective, AlpInvest investment professionals seek to position
	the Fund of Funds Solutions to capitalize on market
	opportunities through focused research and allocation of
	resources. From a

	bottom-up

	perspective, they seek to build deep relationships with
	underlying fund managers that are strengthened by the investment
	professionals relevant experience in the broader financial
	markets. AlpInvest investment professionals hold advisory board
	positions in the vast majority of the active funds in which it
	has invested.




	 




	 


	 



	Discipline.

	  AlpInvest professionals focus on
	diversification, risk management and downside protection. Its
	processes include the analysis and interpretation of
	macro-developments in the global economy and the assessment of a
	wide variety of issues which can influence the emphasis placed
	on sectors, geographies and asset classes when constructing
	investment portfolios. A team of AlpInvest investment
	professionals performs investment analysis of each proposed
	investment with an underlying fund manager or company that
	includes due diligence and market analysis, considering both
	financial and non-financial issues. All investment decisions
	must ultimately be approved by a majority of the members of
	AlpInvests Investment Committee, which is comprised of
	five AlpInvest managing partners. After making an investment
	commitment, the investment portfolios are subject to at least
	semi-annual reviews comprising both quantitative and qualitative
	performance evaluations conducted by the respective investment
	team responsible for each investment as well as AlpInvests
	chief financial officer and chief operating officer.




	 




	 


	 



	Innovation.

	  AlpInvest professionals seek to
	leverage the intellectual capital within its organization and
	strategy-focused investment teams to take advantage of synergies
	that exist within other areas of the firm to identify emerging
	trends, market anomalies and new investment technologies to
	facilitate the formation of new strategies, as well as to set
	the direction for exiting strategies. This market intelligence
	provides them with an additional feedback channel for the
	development of new investment products.




	 




	 


	 



	Corporate Social Responsibility
	(CSR).

	  AlpInvest has adopted the UN
	Global Compact as a CSR framework to evaluate fund managers and
	portfolio companies. AlpInvest has fully integrated CSR into its
	investment process and actively engages with fund managers and
	other stakeholders in the private equity markets to promote
	sustainability and improved corporate governance. In addition,
	the firm seeks opportunities to invest in sustainability
	solutions.

	Our
	Family of Funds





	 


	The following chart presents the name (acronym), total capital
	commitments (in the case of our carry and structured credit
	funds, and fund of funds vehicles), assets under management (in
	the case of our hedge funds) and vintage year of the active
	funds in each of our segments, as of December 31, 2011. We
	present total capital commitments (as opposed to assets under
	management) for our closed-end investment funds because we
	believe this metric provides the most useful information
	regarding the relative size and scale of such funds. In the case
	of our hedge funds, which are open-ended and accordingly do not
	have permanent committed capital, we believe the most useful
	metric regarding relative size and scale is assets under
	management.


	 






	 




	Capital
	Raising and Investor Services





	 


	Since inception, we have raised approximately $117 billion
	in capital (excluding acquisitions). We have successfully and
	repeatedly raised long-term, non-redeemable capital commitments
	to new and successor private funds. Despite the recent
	challenges in the fundraising markets, from December 31,
	2007 through December 31, 2011, we had closings for
	commitments totaling approximately $32 billion across
	30 funds and related co-investment vehicles, as well as net
	inflows to our hedge funds.


	 


	Our diverse and sophisticated investor base includes more than
	1,400 active carry fund investors located in 72 countries.
	Included among our many longstanding fund investors are pension
	funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and high net
	worth individuals in the United States and around the world,
	including significant institutional investors in Asia and the
	Middle





	220








	 






	 



	East. We have also been a leader in the industry by forging
	strategic relationships with large institutional investors such
	as CalPERS, which completed a minority investment in our
	business in 2001, and Mubadala, which made minority investments
	in our business in 2007 and 2010. Both CalPERS and Mubadala have
	also historically been significant investors in our funds. We
	have also devoted substantial resources to creating
	comprehensive and timely investor reports, which is increasingly
	important to our investor base.


	 


	We work for our fund investors and continuously seek to
	strengthen and expand our relationships with our fund investors.
	We have a dedicated in-house LP relations group, which includes
	23 geographically focused investor relations professionals
	with extensive investor relations and fundraising experience,
	supported by 31 product and client segment specialists and
	support staff operating on a global basis and drawing upon a
	worldwide network of relationships. We strive to secure a
	first-mover advantage with key investors, often by establishing
	a local presence and providing a broad and diverse range of
	investment options.


	 


	Our LP relations professionals are in constant dialogue with our
	fund investors, which enables us to monitor client preferences
	and tailor future fund offerings to meet investor demand. As of
	December 31, 2011, approximately 91% of commitments to our
	active carry funds (by dollar amount) were from investors who
	are committed to more than one active carry fund, and
	approximately 58% of commitments to our active carry funds (by
	dollar amount) were from investors who are committed to more
	than five active carry funds. Of the approximately 9% of
	commitments to our active carry funds from investors that are
	not committed to more than one active carry fund, the majority
	(approximately 69%, by dollar amount) of these commitments are
	in the newest generation of funds. We believe the loyalty of our
	investor base, as evidenced by our substantial number of
	multi-fund investors, enhances our ability to raise successor
	funds in existing strategies.


	 


	The chart below shows the percentage of capital committed by
	investors to our active carry funds, in billions, segmented by
	the number of active carry funds in which the investors were
	committed as of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
	2011, respectively. For example, as of December 31, 2006,
	22% of our capital was provided by investors who had committed
	capital to more than 10 active carry funds; as of
	December 31, 2011, that percentage had grown to more than
	30% of our committed capital to active carry funds. As of
	December 31, 2006, 50% of the capital of our active carry
	funds was provided by investors who were committed to six or
	more active carry funds; as of December 31, 2011, that
	percentage had grown to approximately 58% of the committed
	capital of our active carry funds.

	Our larger investors (those with $100 million or more of
	aggregate capital commitments to our active carry funds) are, on
	average, invested in over seven active carry funds.

	We believe that there is a substantial opportunity for growth in
	investor allocations to the alternative investment sector, as
	the significant capital invested in the sector during

	2006-2008

	is
	returned to investors and as certain categories of alternative
	investors (such as pension funds) seek higher investment returns
	to close the gap between their assets and projected liabilities.
	We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this sector
	growth, due to the breadth of our investor relationships, the
	diversity of our product offerings and our track record of
	investment performance.


	 


	We have a team of over 400 investor services professionals
	worldwide. The investor services group performs a range of
	functions to support our investment teams and our LP relations
	group, including informing investors on an ongoing basis about
	the performance of Carlyle investments. This group provides an
	important control function, ensures that transactions are
	structured pursuant





	222








	 






	 



	to the partnership agreements and assists in regulatory
	compliance requirements globally. Our investor services
	professionals assist with investor reporting and enable
	investors to easily monitor the performance of their
	investments. The investor services group also works closely with
	each funds lifecycle, from fund formation and investments
	to portfolio monitoring and fund liquidation. We maintain an
	internal legal and compliance team, which includes 22
	professionals and a government relations group with a presence
	around the globe, which includes 19 professionals. We intend to
	continue to build and invest in our legal, regulatory and
	compliance functions to enable our investment teams to better
	serve our investors.



	 




	Structure
	and Operation of Our Investment Funds





	 


	We conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and
	other investment vehicles primarily through a partnership
	structure in which limited partnerships organized by us accept
	commitments

	and/or

	funds
	for investment from institutional investors and high net worth
	individuals. Each investment fund that is a limited partnership,
	or partnership fund, has a general partner that is
	responsible for the management and administration of the
	funds affairs and makes all policy and investment
	decisions relating to the conduct of the investment funds
	business. The limited partners of the partnership funds take no
	part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds,
	have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and
	have no influence over the voting or disposition of the
	securities or other assets held by such funds, although such
	limited partners often have the right to remove the general
	partner or cause an early liquidation by simple majority vote,
	as discussed below. In the case of our separately managed
	accounts, the investor, rather than us, may control the asset or
	investment vehicle that holds or has custody of the investments
	we advise the vehicle to make.


	 


	Each investment fund and in the case of our separately managed
	accounts, the client, engages an investment adviser. Carlyle
	Investment Management L.L.C. (CIM) serves as an
	investment adviser for most of our funds and is registered under
	the Advisers Act. Our investment advisers or one of their
	affiliates are entitled to a management fee from each investment
	fund for which they serve as investment advisers. For a
	discussion of the management fees to which our investment
	advisers are entitled across our various types of investment
	funds, please see  Incentive
	Arrangements / Fee Structure below.


	 


	The investment funds themselves do not register as investment
	companies under the 1940 Act, in reliance on
	Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof or, typically
	in the case of funds formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1)
	thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exempts from the
	1940 Acts registration requirements investment funds
	privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned
	exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such
	securities, are qualified purchasers as defined
	under the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act exempts
	from the 1940 Acts registration requirements privately
	placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned
	by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under certain
	current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the
	1940 Act exempts from registration any

	non-U.S. investment

	fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned
	either by

	non-U.S. residents

	or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers and
	purchase their interests in a private placement.


	 


	The governing agreements of substantially all of our investment
	funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party
	investors in those funds have the right to remove the general
	partner of the fund or to accelerate the liquidation date of the
	investment fund without cause by a simple vote of a majority in
	interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors. In
	addition, the governing agreements of many of our investment
	funds generally require investors in those funds to vote to
	continue the investment period by a vote of a simple majority in
	interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors in the
	event that certain key persons in our investment
	funds (for example, Messrs. Conway, DAniello and
	Rubenstein in the case of our private equity funds) do not
	provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm or
	cease to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests
	in the general partner or the investment adviser.




	223








	 






	 



	Our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles are closed-ended
	funds. In a closed-ended fund structure, once an investor makes
	an investment, the investor is generally not able to withdraw or
	redeem its interest, except in very limited circumstances.
	Furthermore, each limited partnership contains restrictions on
	an investors ability to transfer its interest in the fund.
	In the few open-ended funds we advise, investors are usually

	locked-up

	for a period of time after which they may generally redeem their
	interests on a quarterly basis.


	 


	With respect to our carry funds, investors generally agree to
	fund their commitment over a period of time. For our private
	equity funds, the commitment period generally runs until the
	earlier of (i) the sixth anniversary of the initial closing
	date or the fifth anniversary of the final closing date of the
	fund; (ii) the date the general partner cancels such
	obligation due to changes in applicable laws or when at least a
	significant portion (which may range between 85% and 90%) of the
	capital commitments to the fund have been invested, committed or
	reserved for investments; (iii) the date a supermajority in
	interest (based on capital commitments) of investors vote to
	terminate the commitment period; or (iv) the failure of
	certain key persons to devote a specified amount of time to such
	fund or Carlyle or to hold a specified percentage of the
	economic interests in the general partner or the investment
	adviser. Following the termination of the commitment period, an
	investor generally will be released from any further obligation
	with respect to its undrawn capital commitment except to the
	extent necessary to pay partnership expenses and management
	fees, complete investments with respect to transactions entered
	into prior to the end of the commitment period and make
	follow-on investments in existing companies. Generally, an
	investors obligation to fund follow-on investments extends
	for a period of three years following the end of the commitment
	period, provided that an investor is generally not required to
	fund more than a certain percentage (generally 15% to 20%) of
	such investors capital commitment in such follow-on
	investments.


	 


	Investors in the latest generation of our real estate funds
	generally commit to fund their investment for a period of three
	(Asia), five (Europe) or four (United States) years from the
	final closing date, provided that the general partner may
	unilaterally extend such expiration date for one year and may
	extend it for another year with the consent of a majority of the
	limited partners or the investment advisory committee for that
	fund. Investors in the latest generation of our real estate
	funds are also obligated to continue to make capital
	contributions with respect to follow-on investments and to repay
	indebtedness for a period of four years after the original
	expiration date of the commitment period, as well as to fund
	partnership expenses and management fees during such extension.


	 


	The term of each of the Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets
	funds generally will end 10 years from the initial closing
	date, or in some cases, from the final closing date, but such
	termination date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances
	or later if extended by the general partner (in many instances
	with the consent of a majority in interest (based on capital
	commitments) of the investors or the investment advisory
	committee) for successive one-year periods, typically up to a
	maximum of two years.


	 





	Incentive
	Arrangements / Fee Structure





	 



	Fund Management Fees.

	  The investment
	adviser of each of our carry funds generally receives an annual
	management fee that ranges from 1.0% to 2.0% of the investment
	fund or vehicles capital commitments during the investment
	period. Following the expiration or termination of the
	investment of such fund the management fees generally step-down
	to between 0.6% and 2.0% of contributions for unrealized
	investments. The investment advisor of our fund of funds
	vehicles receives an annual management fee from such fund of
	funds vehicles that generally ranges from 0.3% to 1.0% on the
	fund or vehicles capital commitments during the first two
	to five years of the investment period and 0.3% to 1.0% on the
	lower of cost of the capital invested or fair value of the
	capital invested thereafter. The investment advisor of our hedge
	funds receives management fees that range from 1.5% to 2% of NAV
	per year. The management fees that we receive from our carry
	funds are payable on a regular basis (typically semi-annually in
	advance) in the contractually prescribed amounts noted above.
	The investment adviser of each of our structured credit funds
	generally receives an annual management fee of





	224








	 






	 



	0.4% to 0.5% of assets per annum. With respect to Claren Road,
	ESG and AlpInvest, we retain a specified percentage of the
	management fees based on our ownership in the management
	companies of 55% in the case of Claren Road and ESG and 60% in
	the case of AlpInvest. The management fees received by our
	Claren Road and ESG funds have similar characteristics, except
	that such funds often afford investors increased liquidity
	through annual, semi-annual or quarterly withdrawal or
	redemption rights following the expiration of a specified period
	of time when capital may not be withdrawn (typically between one
	and three years) and the amount of management fees to which the
	investment adviser is entitled with respect thereto will
	proportionately increase as the net asset value of each
	investors capital account grows and will proportionately
	decrease as the net asset value of each investors capital
	account decreases.


	 


	The general partners or investment advisers to our carry funds
	receive customary transaction fees upon consummation of many of
	our funds acquisition transactions, receive monitoring
	fees from many of their portfolio companies following
	acquisition, and may from time to time receive other fees in
	connection with their activities. The ongoing monitoring fees
	which they receive are generally calculated as a percentage of a
	specified financial metric of a particular portfolio company.
	The transaction fees which they receive are generally calculated
	as a percentage (that generally range up to 1% and may exceed 1%
	in certain circumstances) of the total enterprise value of the
	acquired entity. The management fees charged to limited partner
	investors are reduced by 50% to 100% of such transaction fees
	and certain other fees that are received by the general partners
	and their affiliates.


	 



	Performance Fees.

	  The general partner of each
	of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles also receives
	carried interest from the carry fund or fund of funds vehicles.
	Carried interest entitles the general partner to a special
	residual allocation of profit on third-party capital. In the
	case of our carry funds, carried interest is generally
	calculated on a realized gain basis, and each
	general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest
	equal to 20% (or 1.8% to 10%, in the case of most of our fund of
	funds vehicles) of the net realized profit (generally taking
	into account unrealized losses) generated by third-party capital
	invested in such fund. Net realized profit or loss is not netted
	between or among funds. Our senior Carlyle professionals and
	other personnel who work in these operations also own interests
	in the general partners of our carry funds and we allocate a
	portion of any carried interest that we earn to these
	individuals in order to better align their interests with our
	own and with those of the investors in the funds. For most carry
	funds, the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred
	limited partner return of 8% or 9%, subject to a

	catch-up

	allocation to the general partner. If, as a result of diminished
	performance of later investments in the life of a carry fund or
	fund of funds vehicles, the carry fund or fund of funds vehicles
	does not achieve investment returns that (in most cases) exceed
	the preferred return threshold or (in almost all cases) the
	general partner receives in excess of 20% (or 1.8% to 10%, in
	the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net
	profits on third-party capital over the life of the fund, we
	will be obligated to repay the amount by which the carried
	interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds amounts
	to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation, which is
	known as a giveback obligation, operates with
	respect to a given carry funds own net investment
	performance only and is typically capped at the after tax amount
	of carried interest received by the general partner. Each
	recipient of carried interest distributions is individually
	responsible for his or her proportionate share of any giveback
	obligation; however, we guarantee the full amount of such
	giveback obligation. Our ability to generate carried
	interest is an important element of our business and carried
	interest has historically accounted for a significant portion of
	our income.


	 


	The timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of
	investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the
	partnership agreements that govern such funds, which generally
	allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an
	investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of
	obligations relating to the return of capital, any realized
	losses, applicable fees and expenses and the applicable annual
	preferred limited partner return. Distributions to eligible
	senior Carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest
	are generally made shortly thereafter. Although Carlyle has
	rarely been obligated to pay giveback, the giveback obligation,
	if any, in respect of





	225








	 






	 



	previously realized carried interest is generally determined and
	due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant
	to the terms of the funds partnership agreement.


	 


	In addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are
	also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from
	certain of our Global Market Strategies funds when the return on
	AUM exceeds previous calendar-year ending or

	date-of-investment

	high-water marks. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive
	fees or allocations equal to 20% of the funds profits for
	the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is
	the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund
	investors account on which incentive fees were paid and
	means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such
	fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investors
	account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior
	year NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investors
	investment, generally excluding any contributions and
	redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. We recognize the
	incentive fees from our hedge funds as they are earned. In these
	arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance
	benchmark has been achieved and are included in performance fees
	in our combined and consolidated statements of operations. These
	incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our
	combined and consolidated financial statements and are treated
	as accrued until paid to us.


	 


	Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management
	team of AlpInvest, such persons are allocated all carried
	interest in respect of the historical investments and
	commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of
	December 31, 2010, 85% of the carried interest in respect
	of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the
	period between 2011 and 2020 and 60% of the carried interest in
	respect of all other commitments (including all future
	commitments from third parties).


	 


	As noted above, in connection with raising new funds or securing
	additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for
	such funds and investments with existing and potential
	investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our
	agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than
	for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our
	competitors. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to
	Our Business Operations  Our investors in future
	funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the
	economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us
	than those of our existing funds, which could adversely affect
	our revenues.


	 





	Capital
	Invested in and Alongside Our Investment Funds





	 


	To further align our interests with those of investors in our
	investment funds, we have invested our own capital and that of
	our senior Carlyle professionals in and alongside the investment
	funds we sponsor and advise. In addition, certain affiliates of
	our senior Carlyle professionals (including friends and family
	members) are permitted, subject to certain restrictions, to
	invest alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise. A
	portion of the proceeds from this offering may be used to fund
	our general partner capital commitments to our investment funds.
	Minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment
	funds are determined separately with respect to each investment
	fund. In addition, we may, from time to time, exercise our right
	to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that
	become available in the ordinary course of their operations. See
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and
	Capital Resources for more information regarding our
	minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. Our
	general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not
	with carried interest or through a management fee waiver program.


	 


	Investors in many of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles
	also generally receive the opportunity to make additional
	co-investments with the investment funds.
	Co-investments are investments arranged by us that are made by
	our limited partner investors (and some other investors in some
	instances) in portfolio companies or other assets, generally on
	substantially the same terms and conditions as those acquired by
	the applicable fund. In certain cases, such co-investments may
	involve additional fees or carried interest. Carlyle and its
	employees and officers have the right to co-invest with each of
	the investment funds on a

	deal-by-deal

	basis, typically in an amount up to 5% of the investment





	226








	 






	 



	opportunity (on top of our base commitment). Many of these
	co-investments are made on an unpromoted basis
	meaning we do not earn management fees or carried interest in
	respect of such investments.



	 




	Corporate
	Citizenship





	 


	We are committed to the principle that building a better
	business means investing responsibly. In September 2008, Carlyle
	developed a set of responsible investment guidelines that
	consider the environmental, social and governance implications
	of certain investments we make. These guidelines were integral
	to shaping the corporate social responsibility guidelines later
	adopted by the members of the Private Equity Growth Capital
	Council. We have worked to integrate these guidelines into our
	investment decision-making process for controlling, corporate
	investments. We are also educating portfolio companies in which
	we have a controlling interest on the guidelines and encouraging
	them to review the guidelines at the board level on an annual
	basis. We were the first global alternative asset management
	firm to release a corporate citizenship report, which catalogues
	and describes our corporate citizenship efforts, including our
	responsible investment policy and practices and those of our
	portfolio companies.


	 


	Building on the investment principles, Carlyle has established a
	working relationship with the EDF. Through this partnership (and
	in collaboration with the Payne Firm, an international
	environmental consulting firm), Carlyle and EDF jointly
	developed a new due diligence framework for the alternative
	asset management sector called the EcoValuScreen.
	This framework goes beyond the traditional focus of risk
	mitigation during the due diligence process by identifying
	opportunities for operational enhancements that will lead to
	better environmental and financial performance during the early
	stages of the investment process. This process enables Carlyle
	professionals to more effectively evaluate the operations of a
	target company, identify the most promising environmental
	management opportunities and incorporate them into the
	post-investment management, governance and reporting plans of
	our portfolio companies.


	 


	We are also a member of the British Venture Capital Association
	and seek to ensure that our U.K.-based portfolio companies are
	compliant, on a voluntary basis, with the Walker Guidelines for
	Disclosure and Transparency when such companies become subject
	to these guidelines. Further, we are also a member of the
	Bundesverband Deutscher Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften (the
	BVK), the German private equity and venture capital
	trade association. We believe that we are compliant with the BVK
	Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency and seek to ensure
	that our German portfolio companies comply with these guidelines
	when they required to do so.



	 




	Information
	Technology





	 


	Information technology is essential for Carlyle to conduct
	investment activities, manage internal administration activities
	and connect a global enterprise. As part of our technology
	strategy and governance processes, we develop and routinely
	refine our technology architecture to leverage solutions that
	will best serve the needs of our investors. Our systems, data,
	network and infrastructure are continuously monitored and
	administered by formal controls and risk management processes
	that also help protect the data and privacy of our employees and
	investors. Our business continuity plan ensures that all
	critical business functions continue in an orderly manner in the
	event of an emergency.



	 






	Competition





	 


	As a global alternative asset manager, we compete with a broad
	array of regional and global organizations for both investors
	and investment opportunities. Generally, our competition varies
	across business lines, geographies and financial markets. We
	believe that our competition for investors is based primarily on
	investment performance; business relationships; the quality of
	services provided to investors; reputation and brand
	recognition; pricing; and the relative attractiveness of the
	particular opportunity in which a particular fund intends to
	invest. We believe





	227








	 






	 



	that competition for investment opportunities varies across
	business lines, but is generally based on industry expertise and
	potential for value-add; pricing; terms; and the structure of a
	proposed investment and certainty of execution.


	 


	We generally compete with sponsors of public and private
	investment funds across all of our segments. Within our
	Corporate Private Equity segment, we also compete with business
	development companies and operating companies acting as
	strategic acquirers. In our Global Market Strategies segment, we
	compete with hedge funds and other CLO issuers. In our Real
	Assets segment, we also compete with real estate development
	companies. In addition to these traditional competitors within
	the global alternative asset management industry, we have
	increasingly faced competition from local and regional firms,
	financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds, in the
	various countries in which we invest. This trend has been
	especially apparent in emerging markets, where local firms tend
	to have more established relationships with the companies in
	which we are attempting to invest. These competitors often fall
	into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may
	represent new types of investors, including high net worth
	individuals, family offices and state-sponsored entities.


	 


	Some of the entities that we compete with as an alternative
	asset manager are substantially larger and have greater
	financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more
	personnel than we do. Several of our competitors also have
	recently raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts
	of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar
	to us, which may create additional competition for investment
	opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower
	cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not
	available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for
	us when sourcing investment opportunities. In addition, some of
	these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different
	risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow
	them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more
	aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also
	be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue
	enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which
	may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for
	such investments.



	 






	Employees





	 


	We believe that one of the strengths and principal reasons for
	our success is the quality and dedication of our people. As of
	December 31, 2011, we employed approximately
	1,300 individuals, including more than 600 investment
	professionals, located in 33 offices across six continents.



	 




	Regulatory
	and Compliance Matters





	 





	United
	States





	 


	Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry
	generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United
	States and elsewhere. The SEC and other regulators around the
	globe have in recent years significantly increased their
	regulatory activities with respect to alternative asset
	management firms. Certain of our businesses are subject to
	compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and
	state governments,

	non-U.S. governments,

	their respective agencies

	and/or

	various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, and any
	failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to
	liability

	and/or

	reputational damage. Our businesses have operated for many years
	within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor
	and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory
	developments that affect our activities. However, additional
	legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators or
	changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws
	and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may
	directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.


	 


	Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment
	advisers with the SEC. Registered investment advisers are
	subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
	Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary
	duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance
	program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest,
	recordkeeping and





	228








	 






	 



	reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on
	agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and
	advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In
	addition, our investment advisers are subject to routine
	periodic examinations by the staff of the SEC. As a result of
	prior examinations, certain additional policies and procedures
	have been put into place in response to the SECs
	recommendations, but no material changes to our investment
	advisers operations have been made. Our investment
	advisers also have not been subject to any regulatory or
	disciplinary actions by the SEC. In addition, if in the future
	we were to sponsor a registered investment company under the
	1940 Act, such registered investment company and our subsidiary
	that serves as its investment adviser would be subject to the
	1940 Act and the rules thereunder, which, among other things,
	regulate the relationship between a registered investment
	company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely
	restrict principal transactions and joint transactions.


	 


	TCG Securities, L.L.C., the affiliate entity through which we
	conduct marketing and fundraising activities, is registered as a
	limited purpose broker/dealer with the SEC and the state
	securities bureaus, and is also a member of the Financial
	Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and
	operates under the international broker/dealer exemption in the
	Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and
	Quebec. Our broker/dealer is subject to regulation and
	examination by the SEC, as well as by the state securities
	regulatory agencies. Additionally, FINRA, a self-regulatory
	organization that is subject to SEC oversight, maintains
	regulatory authority over all securities firms doing business in
	the United States, including our broker/dealer, adopts and
	enforces rules governing the activities of its member firms and
	conducts cycle examinations and targeted sweep inquiries on
	issues of immediate concern, among other roles and
	responsibilities.


	 


	Broker/dealers are subject to rules relating to transactions on
	a particular exchange

	and/or

	market, and rules relating to the internal operations of the
	firms and their dealings with customers including, but not
	limited to the form or organization of the firm, qualifications
	of associated persons, officers and directors, net capital and
	customer protection rules, books and records and financial
	statements and reporting. In particular, as a result of its
	registered status, our broker/dealer is subject to the
	SECs uniform net capital rule,

	Rule 15c3-1,

	which specifies both the minimum level of net capital a
	broker/dealer must maintain relative to the scope of its
	business activities and net capital liquidity parameters. The
	SEC and FINRA require compliance with key financial
	responsibility rules including maintenance of adequate funds to
	meet expenses and contractual obligations, as well as early
	warning rules that compel notice to the regulators via
	accelerated financial reporting anytime a firms capital
	falls below the minimum required level. The uniform net capital
	rule limits the amount of qualifying subordinated debt that is
	treated as equity to a specific percentage under the

	debt-to-equity

	ratio test, and further limits the withdrawal of equity capital,
	which is subject to specific notice provisions. Finally,
	compliance with net capital rules may also limit a firms
	ability to expand its operations, particularly to those
	activities that require the use of capital.


	 


	In connection with our acquisition on July 1, 2011 of ESG
	and Emerging Sovereign Partners LLC (ESP), which
	operate together as an emerging markets equities and
	macroeconomic strategies investment manager, we and our three
	founders were each required to register with the United States
	Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and
	the National Futures Commission (the NFA) as
	Principals of ESG and ESP. ESG and ESP are both registered with
	the CFTC and the NFA as Commodity Pool Operators (and with
	respect to ESG, also as a Commodity Trading Advisor). The
	requirement to register as a Principal of ESG and ESP was
	triggered by the fact that, as a result of the acquisition, we
	and our three founders each hold more than ten percent of a
	class of securities of ESG and ESP.

	activities regulated under FSMA, including





	229








	 






	 



	advising, dealing as principal or agent and arranging deals in

	corporate finance, use and safekeeping of client funds and
	securities, regulatory capital, record keeping, margin practices
	and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money
	laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures. The
	Financial Services Authority is responsible for administering
	these requirements and our compliance with them. Violations of
	these requirements may result in censures, fines, imposition of
	additional requirements, injunctions, restitution orders,
	revocation or modification of permissions or registrations, the

	in certain financial activities regulated under the DFSA rules,
	including managing collective investment funds, arranging credit

	Two of our subsidiaries, Carlyle Mauritius Investment Advisor
	Limited (Carlyle Mauritius) and Carlyle Mauritius
	CIS Investment Management Limited (Carlyle CIS
	Manager) are licensed providers of investment management
	services in the Republic of Mauritius and are subject to
	applicable Mauritian securities laws and the oversight of the
	Financial Services Commission (Mauritius)
	(the FSC). Each of Carlyle Mauritius and
	Carlyle CIS Manager is subject to limited regulatory
	requirements under the Mauritian Securities Act 2005, Mauritian
	Financial Services Act 2007 and relevant ancillary regulations,
	including, ongoing reporting and record keeping requirements,
	anti-money laundering obligations, obligations to ensure that it
	and its directors, key officers and representatives are fit and
	proper and requirements to maintain positive shareholders
	equity. FSC is responsible for administering these requirements
	and ensuring the compliance of Carlyle Mauritius and Carlyle CIS
	Manager with them. If Carlyle Mauritius or Carlyle CIS Manager
	contravenes any such requirements, such entities

	and/or

	their
	officers or representatives may be subject to a fine, reprimand,
	prohibition order or other regulatory sanctions.


	 


	In addition, Carlyle Mauritius holds a Foreign

	Exchange Board of India (the SEBI). The license
	entitles Carlyle Mauritius, for itself and

	If Carlyle Mauritius contravenes any such requirements, Carlyle
	Mauritius

	and/or

	its
	officers or representatives may be subject to a fine, reprimand,

	Carlyle Australia Equity Management Pty Limited
	(CAEM), one of our subsidiaries, is incorporated in
	Australia and is licensed by the Australian Securities and
	Investments Commission as an Australian financial services
	licensee. As an Australian financial services licensee, CAEM is
	authorized to carry on a financial services business to
	(a) provide financial product advice in respect of
	interests in managed investment schemes and securities to
	wholesale clients and (b) deal in financial products by

	Corporations Act

	2001 (Cth) (CA) and other
	financial services laws in Australia.


	 


	In addition, we

	and/or

	our
	affiliates and subsidiaries may become subject to additional
	regulatory demands in the future to the extent we expand our
	investment advisory business in existing and new jurisdictions.



	 






	Properties





	 


	Our principal executive offices are located in leased office
	space at 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. We
	also lease the space for our other 32 offices, including our
	office in Arlington, Virginia, which houses our treasury and
	finance functions. We do not own any real property. We consider
	these facilities to be suitable and adequate for the management
	and operation of our business.



	 






	Legal
	Proceedings





	 


	From time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings,
	lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business.
	Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which
	may result in regulatory proceedings against us.


	 


	In September 2006 and March 2009, we received requests for
	certain documents and other information from the Antitrust
	Division of the DOJ in connection with the DOJs
	investigation of global alternative asset management firms to
	determine whether they have engaged in conduct prohibited by
	U.S. antitrust laws. We have fully cooperated with the
	DOJs investigation. There can be no assurance as to the
	direction this inquiry may take in the future or whether it will
	have an adverse impact on the private equity industry in some
	unforeseen way.


	 


	On February 14, 2008, a private

	class-action

	lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged
	anti-competitive business practices was filed in the
	U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
	(

	Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of
	Detroit v. Apollo Global Management, LLC

	). The
	complaint alleges, among other things, that certain global
	alternative asset management firms, including Carlyle, violated
	Section 1 of the Sherman Act by, among other things,
	forming multi-sponsor consortiums for the purpose of bidding
	collectively in certain going private transactions, which the
	plaintiffs allege constitutes a conspiracy in restraint of
	trade. The plaintiffs seek damages as provided for in
	Section 4 of the Clayton Act and an injunction against such
	conduct in restraint of trade in the future. While Carlyle
	believes the claims are without merit and will vigorously
	contest all claims, it is difficult to determine what impact, if
	any, this litigation (and any future related litigation),
	together with any increased governmental scrutiny or regulatory
	initiatives, will have on the private equity industry generally
	or on Carlyle.


	 


	Along with many other companies and individuals in the financial
	sector, Carlyle and one of our corporate mezzanine funds
	(CMP I) are named as defendants in

	Foy v. Austin
	Capital,

	a case filed





	231








	 






	 



	in June 2009, pending in the state of New Mexicos First
	Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, which purports to
	be a

	qui tam

	suit on behalf of the State of New Mexico.
	The suit alleges that investment decisions by New Mexico public
	investment funds were improperly influenced by campaign
	contributions and payments to politically connected placement
	agents. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, actual damages,
	actual damages for lost income, rescission of the investment
	transactions described in the complaint and disgorgement of all
	fees received. In May 2011, the Attorney General of New Mexico
	moved to dismiss certain defendants including Carlyle and
	CMP I on the ground that separate civil litigation by the
	Attorney General is a more effective means to seek recovery for
	the State from these defendants. The Attorney General has
	brought two civil actions against certain of those defendants,
	not including the Carlyle defendants. The Attorney General has
	stated that its investigation is continuing and it may bring
	additional civil actions. We are currently unable to anticipate
	when the litigation will conclude, or what impact the litigation
	may have on us.


	 


	In July 2009, a former shareholder of Carlyle Capital
	Corporation Limited claiming to have lost $20.0 million,
	filed a claim against CCC, Carlyle and certain of our affiliates
	and one of our officers (

	Huffington v. TC Group L.L.C. et
	al.)

	alleging violations of Massachusetts blue
	sky law provisions and related claims involving material
	misrepresentations and omissions allegedly made during and after
	the marketing of CCC. The plaintiff seeks treble damages,
	interest, expenses and attorneys fees and to have the
	subscription agreement deemed null and void and a full refund of
	the investment. In March 2010, the United States District Court
	for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the plaintiffs
	complaint on the grounds that it should have been filed in
	Delaware instead of Massachusetts, and the plaintiff
	subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court
	of Appeals for the First Circuit. The plaintiff lost his appeal
	to the First Circuit and has filed a new claim in Delaware state
	court. The Delaware state court granted in part and denied in
	part defendants motion for summary judgment. The
	defendants are vigorously contesting the one remaining claim
	asserted by the plaintiff.


	 


	In November 2009, another CCC investor instituted legal
	proceedings on similar grounds in Kuwaits Court of First
	Instance (

	National Industries Group v. Carlyle
	Group

	) seeking to recover losses incurred in connection with
	an investment in CCC. In July 2011, the Delaware Court of
	Chancery issued a decision restraining the plaintiff from
	proceeding in Kuwait against either Carlyle Investment
	Management L.L.C. or TC Group, L.L.C., based on the forum
	selection clause in the plaintiffs subscription agreement,
	which provided for exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts. In
	September 2011, the plaintiff reissued its complaint in Kuwait
	naming CCC only, and reissued its complaint in January 2012
	joining Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. as a defendant. We
	believe these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously
	contest all such allegations.


	 


	The Guernsey liquidators who took control of CCC in March 2008
	filed four suits in July 2010 against Carlyle, certain of our
	affiliates and the former directors of CCC in the Delaware
	Chancery Court, the Royal Court of Guernsey, the Superior Court
	of the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court of New York,
	New York County, (

	Carlyle Capital Corporation Limited v.
	Conway et al.

	) seeking $1.0 billion in damages. They
	allege that Carlyle and the CCC board of directors were
	negligent, grossly negligent or willfully mismanaged the CCC
	investment program and breached certain fiduciary duties
	allegedly owed to CCC and its shareholders. The Liquidators
	further allege (among other things) that the directors and
	Carlyle put the interests of Carlyle ahead of the interests of
	CCC and its shareholders and gave priority to preserving and
	enhancing Carlyles reputation and its brand
	over the best interests of CCC. The defendants filed a
	comprehensive motion to dismiss in Delaware in October 2010. In
	December 2010, the Liquidators dismissed the complaint in
	Delaware voluntarily and without prejudice and expressed an
	intent to proceed against the defendants in Guernsey. Carlyle
	filed an action in Delaware seeking an injunction against the
	Liquidators to preclude them from proceeding in Guernsey in
	violation of a Delaware exclusive jurisdiction clause contained
	in the investment management agreement. In July 2011, the Royal
	Court of Guernsey held that the case should be litigated in
	Delaware pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. That
	ruling was appealed by the Liquidators, and in February 2012 was
	reversed by the Guernsey Court





	232








	 






	 



	of Appeal, which held that the case should proceed in Guernsey.
	Carlyle intends to seek review of that ruling pursuant to an
	application for special leave to the Privy Council. Carlyle will
	also request a stay of further proceedings, pending
	consideration of the appeal application, from the Privy Council.
	Also, in October 2011, the plaintiffs obtained an

	ex parte

	anti-anti-suit injunction in Guernsey against Carlyles
	anti-suit claim in Delaware. That ruling has been affirmed by
	the Guernsey Court of Appeal. Carlyle anticipates that it will
	seek a further appeal before the Privy Council on the
	anti-anti-suit injunction order. The Liquidators lawsuits
	in New York and the District of Columbia were dismissed in
	December 2011 without prejudice. We believe that regardless of
	where the claims are litigated, they are without merit and we
	will vigorously contest all allegations. We recognized a loss of
	$152.3 million in 2008 in connection with the winding up of
	CCC.


	 


	In June 2011, August 2011, and September 2011, three putative
	shareholder class actions were filed against Carlyle, certain of
	our affiliates and former directors of CCC alleging that the
	fund offering materials and various public disclosures were
	materially misleading or omitted material information. Two of
	the shareholder class actions, (

	Phelps

	v.

	Stomber, et
	al.

	) and (

	Glaubach

	v.

	Carlyle Capital Corporation
	Limited, et al.

	), were filed in the United States District
	Court for the District of Columbia. The most recent shareholder
	class action (

	Phelps

	v.

	Stomber, et al.

	) was filed
	in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County and has
	subsequently been removed to the United States District Court
	for the Southern District of New York. The two original D.C.
	cases were consolidated into one case, under the caption of

	Phelps v. Stomber,

	and the Phelps named plaintiffs have
	been designated lead plaintiffs by the court. The
	New York case has been transferred to the D.C. federal court and
	the plaintiffs have requested that it be consolidated with the
	other two D.C. actions. The defendants have opposed and have
	moved to dismiss the case as duplicative. The plaintiffs in all
	three cases seek all compensatory damages sustained as a result
	of the alleged misrepresentations, costs and expenses, as well
	as reasonable attorney fees. The defendants have filed a
	comprehensive motion to dismiss. We believe the claims are
	without merit and will vigorously contest all claims.

	Composition
	of the Board of Directors after this Offering





	 


	Prior to the closing of this offering, we expect that seven
	additional directors, including five directors who are
	independent in accordance with the criteria established by the
	NASDAQ Global Select Market for independent board members, will
	be appointed to the board of directors of our general partner,
	Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., an entity wholly owned by our
	senior Carlyle professionals. Following these additions, we
	expect that the board of directors of our general partner will
	consist of ten directors, five of whom will be independent.
	Mubadala has waived the right under its subscription agreement
	to nominate a member of the board of directors of our general
	partner.


	 


	The limited liability company agreement of Carlyle Group
	Management L.L.C. establishes a board of directors that will be
	responsible for the oversight of our business and operations.
	Our common unitholders will have no right to elect the directors
	of our general partner unless, as determined on January 31 of
	each year, the total voting power held by holders of the special
	voting units in The Carlyle Group L.P. (including voting units
	held by our general partner and its affiliates) in their
	capacity as such, or otherwise held by then-current or former
	Carlyle personnel (treating voting units deliverable to such
	persons pursuant to outstanding equity awards as being held by
	them), collectively, constitutes less than 10% of the voting
	power of the outstanding voting units of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	Unless and until the foregoing voting power condition is
	satisfied, our general partners board of directors will be
	elected in accordance with its limited liability company
	agreement, which provides that directors may be appointed and
	removed by members of our general partner holding a majority in
	interest of the voting power of the members, which voting power
	is allocated to each member ratably according to his or her
	aggregate ownership of our common units and partnership units.
	See Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	Partnership Agreement  Election of Directors of
	General Partner.


	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. is a limited partnership that is advised
	by our general partner. We intend to avail ourselves of the
	limited partnership exception from certain governance rules,
	which eliminates the





	237








	 






	 



	requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on
	our board of directors and that we have independent director
	oversight of executive officer compensation and director
	nominations. In addition, we will not be required to hold annual
	meetings of our common unitholders.


	 





	Director
	Qualifications





	 


	When determining that each of our directors and director
	nominees is particularly well-suited to serve on the board of
	directors of our general partner and that each has the
	experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a
	whole, to enable our board of directors to satisfy its oversight
	responsibilities effectively, we considered the experience and
	qualifications of each described above under
	 Directors and Executive Officers.


	 


	With regard to:


	 












	 


	 


	Messrs. Conway, DAniello and Rubenstein 
	we considered that these three individuals are the original
	founders of our firm, that each has played an integral role in
	our firms successful growth since its founding in 1987,
	and that each has developed a unique and unparalleled
	understanding of our business. Finally, we also noted that these
	three individuals are our largest equity owners and, as a
	consequence of such alignment of interest with our other equity
	owners, each has additional motivation to diligently fulfill his
	oversight responsibilities as a member of the board of directors
	of our general partner.




	 




	 


	 


	Mr. Fishman  we considered his knowledge and
	expertise in the financial services industry as Chairman and
	Chief Executive Officer of The Travelers Companies, as well as

	control resulting from his extensive public company operating
	and management experience.

	background and experience in a distinguished career at Goldman,
	Sachs in the areas of investment banking and risk analysis,
	including her unique insights into the operation of global
	capital markets.




	 




	 


	 


	Mr. Hance  we considered his invaluable
	perspective owing to his experience in various senior leadership
	roles in the financial services industry, including his role as

	which included responsibility for financial and accounting
	matters, as well as his familiarity with our business and
	operations as an Operating Executive of Carlyle.




	 




	 


	 


	Ms. Hill  we considered her insights into the
	operations of public companies owing to her experience as a
	consultant, as well as her familiarity with board
	responsibilities, oversight and control resulting from her
	significant experience serving on the boards of directors of
	various public companies.




	 




	 


	 


	Mr. Mathias  we considered his extensive
	knowledge and expertise in the investment management business,
	as well as his knowledge of and familiarity with our business
	and operations.




	 




	 


	 


	Dr. Robertson  we considered his distinguished
	career as a professor and Dean of the Wharton School at the
	University of Pennsylvania and his extensive knowledge and
	expertise in finance and business administration.

	Committees
	of the Board of Directors

	established an executive committee. We anticipate that at the
	time of this offering, the board of directors of Carlyle Group
	Management L.L.C. will establish an audit committee and will
	adopt a charter for the audit





	238








	 






	 



	committee that complies with current federal and NASDAQ Global
	Select Market rules relating to corporate governance matters. We
	also anticipate that the board of directors of Carlyle Group
	Management L.L.C. will establish a conflicts committee. The
	board of directors of our general partner may establish other
	committees from time to time.


	 



	Audit committee.

	  After this offering, we
	expect that our audit committee will consist of Ms. Fitt
	and Messrs. Robertson and Shaw, with Mr. Shaw serving
	as chairman. The purpose of the audit committee of the board of
	directors of Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. will be to provide
	assistance to the board of directors in fulfilling its
	obligations with respect to matters involving our accounting,
	auditing, financial reporting, internal control and legal
	compliance functions, including, without limitation, assisting
	the board of directors oversight of (1) the quality
	and integrity of our financial statements, (2) our
	compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our
	independent registered public accounting firms
	qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of
	our independent registered public accounting firm and our
	internal audit function, and directly appointing, retaining,
	reviewing and terminating our independent registered public
	accounting firm. The members of our audit committee will meet
	the independence standards for service on an audit committee of
	a board of directors pursuant to federal and NASDAQ Global
	Select Market rules relating to corporate governance matters,
	including the permitted transition period for newly-reporting
	issuers.


	 



	Conflicts committee.

	  The board of directors of
	Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. will establish a conflicts
	committee that will be charged with reviewing specific matters
	that our general partners board of directors believes may
	involve conflicts of interest. The conflicts committee will
	determine if the resolution of any conflict of interest
	submitted to it is fair and reasonable to us. Any matters
	approved by the conflicts committee will be conclusively deemed
	to be fair and reasonable to us and not a breach by us of any
	duties we may owe to our common unitholders. In addition, the
	conflicts committee may review and approve any related person
	transactions, other than those that are approved pursuant to our
	related person policy, as described under Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
	Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related
	Persons, and may establish guidelines or rules to cover
	specific categories of transactions. The members of the
	conflicts committee will have been determined by the board to
	meet the independence standards for service on an audit
	committee of a board of directors pursuant to federal and NASDAQ
	Global Select Market rules relating to corporate governance
	matters.

	Compensation
	Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation





	 


	We do not have a compensation committee. Our founders,
	Messrs. Conway, DAniello and Rubenstein, have
	historically made all final determinations regarding executive
	officer compensation. The board of directors of our general
	partner has determined that maintaining our current compensation
	practices following this offering is desirable and intends that
	these practices will continue. Accordingly, the board of
	directors of our general partner does not intend to establish a
	compensation committee. For a description of certain
	transactions between us and Messrs. Conway, DAniello
	and Rubenstein, see Certain Relationships and Related

	Accordingly, we have not presented a Director Compensation Table.


	 


	Following this offering, our employees who serve as directors of
	our general partner will receive no separate compensation for
	service on the board of directors or on committees of the board
	of directors of our general partner. Certain of the nominees to
	the board of directors of our general partner are employees of
	or advisors to Carlyle and have received compensation or other
	payments in respect of their services in such capacities. See
	Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Other Transactions. Each director
	that is not an employee of or advisor to Carlyle will receive an
	annual retainer of $175,000, $125,000 of which will be payable
	in cash and $50,000 of which will be payable in the form of an
	annual deferred restricted common unit award, which will vest on
	the first anniversary of the grant date. An additional $20,000
	cash retainer will be payable annually to the chairman of the
	audit committee. Directors that are not employees of or advisors
	to Carlyle who are appointed to serve on the board of directors
	of our general partner at the time of this offering will also
	receive $200,000 of deferred restricted common units under our
	Equity Incentive Plan, which will vest in equal annual
	installments over the following three years, subject to the
	recipients continued service as a director. In addition,
	each director will be reimbursed for reasonable

	out-of-pocket

	expenses incurred in connection with such service.


	 







	Executive
	Compensation





	 





	Compensation
	Discussion and Analysis





	 




	Compensation
	Philosophy




	 


	Our business as an alternative asset management firm is
	dependent on the services of our named executive officers and
	other key employees. Among other things, we depend on their
	ability to find, select and execute investments, oversee and
	improve portfolio company operations, find and develop
	relationships with fund investors and other sources of capital
	and provide other services essential to our success. Therefore,
	it is important that our key employees are compensated in a
	manner that motivates them to excel and encourages them to
	remain with our firm.


	 


	Our compensation policy has three primary objectives:
	(1) establish a clear relationship between performance and
	compensation, (2) align long-term incentives with our fund
	investors and common unitholders and (3) comply with
	applicable laws and regulations.


	 


	We believe that the key to achieving these objectives is an
	organized, unbiased approach that is well understood, responsive
	to changes in the industry and the general labor market, and,
	above all, flexible and timely. We seek to pursue these
	objectives to the extent that our financial situation and other
	factors permit.


	 


	Our senior Carlyle professionals and other key employees invest
	a significant amount of their own capital in or alongside the
	funds we advise. These investments are funded with cash and not
	with deferral of management or incentive fees. In addition,
	these individuals may be allocated a portion of the carried
	interest or incentive fees payable in respect of our investment
	funds. We believe that this approach of seeking to align the
	interests of our key employees with those of the investors in
	our funds has been a key contributor to our strong performance
	and growth. We also believe that continued equity ownership by
	our named executive officers once we are a public company will
	result in significant alignment of their interests with those of
	our common unitholders.


	 


	Our chairman, Daniel A. DAniello and our two co-chief
	executive officers, William E. Conway, Jr. and David M.
	Rubenstein, are our founders and co-principal executive
	officers. We refer to our founders, together with Glenn A.
	Youngkin, our chief operating officer, Adena T. Friedman, our
	chief financial officer, and Jeffrey W. Ferguson, our general
	counsel, as our named executive officers.
	Mr. Youngkin served as our interim principal financial
	officer from October 2010 until March 2011. Effective on
	March 28, 2011, Adena T. Friedman became our principal
	financial officer.

	With the exception of our employment agreement with
	Ms. Friedman described below under
	 Employment Agreement with
	Ms. Friedman, we do not have employment agreements
	with any of our executive officers. Our founders have entered
	into non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with us
	described below under  Summary Compensation
	Table  Founders Non-Competition and
	Non-Solicitation Agreements and are also subject to
	certain limitations on cash compensation pursuant to commitments
	made to CalPERS and Mubadala described below under
	 Compensation Elements  Annual Cash
	Bonuses.


	 




	Compensation
	Elements




	 


	The primary elements of our compensation program are base
	salary, annual cash bonuses and long-term incentives, such as
	the ownership of carried interest. We believe that the elements
	of compensation for our named executive officers serve the
	primary objectives of our compensation program. However, we
	intend to periodically review the compensation of our named
	executive officers, and we may make changes to the compensation
	structure relating to one or more named executive officers based
	on the outcome of such reviews from time to time. Following this
	offering, compensation decisions and those regarding the
	allocation of carried interest to our senior Carlyle
	professionals and other employees will continue to be made by
	our founders and other senior Carlyle professionals and not by
	our independent directors.


	 



	Base Salary.

	  For 2011, each of our named
	executive officers was paid an annual salary of $275,000. We
	believe that the base salary of our named executive officers
	should typically not be the most significant component of total
	compensation. Our founders determined that this amount was a
	sufficient minimum base salary for our named executive officers
	and decided that it should be the same for all named executive
	officers.


	 



	Annual Cash Bonuses.

	  For 2011, our named
	executive officers were awarded cash bonuses, part of which were
	paid in December 2011 and the balance of which were paid in
	March 2012. The amounts of these bonuses were $3,545,850 for
	each of our founders, $3,000,000 for Mr. Youngkin,
	$1,900,000 for Ms. Friedman and $1,100,000 for Mr.
	Ferguson. The discretionary bonuses to our named executive
	officers were recommended by Mr. DAniello and were
	approved by all three of our founders. The subjective factors
	that contributed to the determination of the bonus amounts
	included an assessment of the performance of Carlyle and the
	investments of the funds that we advise, the contributions of
	the named executive officer to our development and success
	during 2011 and the named executive officers tenure at his
	or her level. More specifically, in assessing
	Mr. Conways performance and individual contribution,
	we considered his service as the firms Chief Investment
	Officer, leadership of the investment process and decisions by
	our Corporate Private Equity and Global Market Strategies
	segments, which executed a significant number of successful
	investments in 2011 and his work in overseeing the management of
	the existing investment portfolio during this period. In
	assessing Mr. DAniellos performance and
	individual contribution, we considered his service as the Chief
	Investment Officer for our Real Assets funds and his role in
	overseeing all administrative operations of our firm. In
	assessing Mr. Rubensteins performance and
	individual contribution, we considered his oversight of our
	investor relations team and the capital commitments to our funds
	that were raised during the year and his leadership on the
	strategic direction of the firm. In assessing
	Mr. Youngkins performance and individual
	contribution, we considered his significant efforts in leading
	the expansion of our investment platform through acquisitions,
	oversight of our business on a global basis and his role as
	interim Chief Financial Officer. In assessing
	Ms. Friedmans performance and individual contribution
	we considered her strategic role in leading and expanding the
	capabilities of our finance and accounting functions during
	2011, her contributions in expanding the platform and
	capabilities of our information technology function, as well as
	her strategic leadership to the founders and senior management
	across the firm. Finally, in assessing Mr. Fergusons
	performance and individual contributions, we considered his
	oversight of our global legal and compliance functions as well
	as the tax department and his role with respect to the strategic
	initiatives undertaken by the firm. Ms. Friedman was
	guaranteed a minimum bonus of $1,725,000 pursuant to our
	contractual arrangements with her. The amounts of the annual
	bonuses paid to our founders were limited to $3,545,850 pursuant
	to a commitment that we





	241








	 






	 



	made to CalPERS at the time of their investment in our firm in
	2001. CalPERS sought this limitation to ensure that the
	interests of our founders would be aligned with their own. When
	Mubadala later invested in our firm in 2007, they sought, and
	received, the same commitment.


	 



	Carried Interest.

	  The general partners of our
	carry funds typically receive a special residual allocation of
	income, which we refer to as a carried interest, from our
	investment funds if investors in such funds achieve a specified
	threshold return. While the Parent Entities own controlling
	equity interests in these fund general partners, our senior
	Carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in these
	operations directly own a portion of the carried interest in
	these entities, in order to better align their interests with
	our own and with those of the investors in these funds.
	Following the reorganization described in Ownership
	Structure, these individuals will own approximately 45% of
	any carried interest in respect of investments made by our carry
	funds, with the exception of our energy and renewable resources
	funds, where we will retain essentially all of the carry to
	which we are entitled under our arrangements with Riverstone.
	Pursuant to commitments we made to CalPERS and Mubadala at the
	times of those institutions investments in our firm, our
	founders own all of their equity interests in our firm through
	their ownership interests in the Parent Entities and,
	accordingly, do not own carried interest at the fund level, but
	instead benefit, together with our other equity owners, from the
	carried interest and other income that is retained by the firm
	through our founders ownership interests in the Parent
	Entities. In addition, we generally seek to concentrate the
	direct ownership of carried interest in respect of each carry
	fund among those of our professionals who directly work with
	that fund so as to align their interests with those of our fund
	investors and of our firm. Accordingly, Ms. Friedman, like
	our founders, does not receive allocations of direct carried
	interest ownership at the fund level. While Mr. Youngkin has
	previously received allocations of direct carried interest
	ownership at the fund level in respect of buyout funds that
	invest in transactions in the United States, Europe and emerging
	markets as a result of his work, at various times, with those
	fund operations, he has ceased to receive such allocations in
	respect of any such funds formed subsequent to the time he
	assumed a firm-wide executive role in 2009. Similarly, while
	Mr. Ferguson has previously received allocations of direct
	carried interest ownership at the fund level in respect of
	buyout funds that invest in transactions in the United States as
	a result of his work with those fund operations, in view of his
	firm-wide role as our general counsel he ceased to receive such
	allocations in 2008.


	 


	Carried interest, if any, in respect of any particular
	investment is only paid in cash when the underlying investment
	is realized. To the extent any giveback obligation
	is triggered, carried interest previously distributed by the
	fund would need to be returned to such fund. Our professionals
	who receive direct allocations of carried interest at the fund
	level are personally subject to the giveback
	obligation, pursuant to which they may be required to repay
	carried interest previously distributed to them, thereby
	reducing the amount of cash received by such recipients for any
	such year. Because the amount of carried interest payable is
	directly tied to the realized performance of the underlying
	investments, we believe this fosters a strong alignment of
	interests among the investors in those funds and the
	professionals who are allocated direct carried interest, and
	thus will indirectly benefit our unitholders.


	 


	The percentage of carried interest owned at the fund level by
	individual professionals varies by year, by investment fund and,
	with respect to each carry fund, by investment. Ownership of
	carried interest by senior Carlyle professionals and other
	personnel at the fund level is also subject to a range of
	vesting schedules. Vesting depends on continued employment over
	specified periods of time, and serves as an employment retention
	mechanism and enhances the alignment of interests between the
	owner of a carried interest allocation and the firm and the
	limited partners in our investment funds. In addition, under the
	arrangements that have historically prevailed prior to this
	offering, if any of the named executive officers (other than the
	founders) were to have ceased to provide services to Carlyle
	prior to the time an investment in a carry fund were realized,
	such named executive officer would forfeit 25% of his or her
	entitlement to any distributions from the Parent Entities
	sourced from carried interest from such investment.


	 



	Post-IPO Equity Compensation Expense.

	  As
	discussed under Organizational Structure, at the
	time of this offering our existing owners will contribute to the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships equity interests





	242








	 






	 



	in our business in exchange for partnership units of Carlyle
	Holdings. All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units received
	by our founders, CalPERS and Mubadala as part of the
	reorganization are fully vested. All of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units received by our other existing owners in
	exchange for their interests in carried interest owned at the
	fund level relating to investments made by our carry funds prior
	to the date of Reorganization will be fully vested. Of the
	remaining Carlyle Holdings partnership units received as part of
	the Reorganization by our other existing owners, 26.2% are fully
	vested and 73.8% are not vested and, with specified exceptions,
	will be subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be
	employed by us prior to vesting. See  Vesting,
	Minimum Retained Ownership Requirement and Transfer
	Restrictions. Accordingly, following this offering, we
	will recognize expense for financial statement reporting
	purposes in respect of the unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units received by our personnel, including the named executive
	officers. The aggregate grant date fair value of such units for
	purposes of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
	Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation 
	Stock Compensation (ASC Topic 718) will appear
	in the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table
	reporting compensation for the year in which this offering
	occurs.


	 





	Summary
	Compensation Table





	 


	The following table presents summary information concerning
	compensation paid or accrued by us for services rendered in all
	capacities by our named executive officers during the fiscal
	year ended December 31, 2011.


	 


	Pursuant to applicable accounting principles, for financial
	statement reporting purposes we have historically recorded
	salary and bonus payments to our senior Carlyle professionals,
	including our named executive officers, as distributions in
	respect of their equity ownership interests and not as
	compensation expense. However, following this offering, the
	salary and bonus payments to our senior Carlyle professionals,
	including our named executive officers, will be reflected as
	compensation expense in our financial statements and we have
	reflected these amounts in the applicable columns of the Summary
	Compensation Table below even though they are not recorded as
	compensation expense in our historical financial statements.


	 


	Similarly, for those of our named executive officers that own
	direct carried interest allocations at the fund level, we have
	reported in the All Other Compensation column amounts that
	represent an amount of compensation expense (positive or
	negative) that would have been recorded by us on an accrual
	basis in respect of such direct carried interest allocations had
	we applied the accounting treatment for the periods presented
	below that will apply upon the effectiveness of this offering.
	These amounts do

	not

	reflect actual cash carried interest
	distributions to our named executive officers. This expense may
	be negative in the event of a reversal of previously accrued
	carried interest due to negative adjustments in the fair value
	of a carry funds investments. The ultimate amounts of
	actual carried interest distributions that may be earned and
	subsequently distributed to our named executive officers may be
	more or less than the amounts indicated in the Summary
	Compensation Table and are not determinable at this time.


	 


	For each of our named executive officers other than our
	founders, we have also reported in the All Other Compensation
	column the portion of the carried interest-related distributions
	received by such named executive officer from the Parent
	Entities during the periods presented that were subject to
	forfeiture as described above under
	 Compensation Discussion and
	Analysis  Compensation Elements  Carried
	Interest.

	commitments we made to CalPERS and Mubadala at the times of
	those institutions investments in our firm, our founders
	own all of their equity interests in our firm through their
	ownership interests in the Parent Entities and, accordingly, do
	not directly own carried interest at the fund level, but instead
	benefit, together with our other equity owners, from the carried
	interest and other income that is retained by the firm through
	our founders ownership interests in the Parent Entities.
	Accordingly, we have not historically recorded, and following
	this offering do not anticipate that we will record,
	compensation expense (positive or negative) in respect of our
	founders indirect ownership of carried interest.





	 





	(2)






	This amount represents our 401(k)
	matching contribution.





	 





	(3)






	Mr. Youngkin served as our
	interim principal financial officer from October 2010 until
	Ms. Friedman became our principal financial officer
	effective on March 28, 2011.





	 





	(4)






	The amounts of compensation expense
	that would have been recorded on an accrual basis in respect of
	direct carried interest allocations to Mr. Youngkin for
	2011 and 2010 was $24,520,556, and $27,709,970, respectively.
	These amounts do not reflect actual cash distributions to
	Mr. Youngkin in respect of direct carried interest
	allocations during such periods, which were $16,034,593 and
	$409,508, respectively. For financial statement reporting
	purposes, compensation expense is equal to the sum of the
	carried interest distributions during the year and the change in
	the value of carried interest during the year related to
	unrealized investments. Such expense could also turn negative in
	the event of a reduction of previously accrued allocation of
	carried interest due to negative adjustments in the fair value
	of fund investments. The ultimate amount of actual carried
	interest that may be realized and received by our named
	executive officers may be more or less than the amounts
	indicated and is unknown at this time. The amounts for 2011 and
	2010 in the table also include $2,048,722 and $216,670,
	respectively, representing the portion of the carried
	interest-related distributions received by Mr. Youngkin
	from the Parent Entities that were subject to forfeiture as
	described above under  Compensation Discussion
	and Analysis  Compensation Elements 
	Carried Interest, as well as $6,125 and $6,125,
	respectively, representing our 401(k) matching contributions for
	such periods.





	 





	(5)






	The amounts of compensation expense
	that would have been recorded on an accrual basis in respect of
	direct carried interest allocations to Mr. Ferguson in respect
	of carried interest allocations for 2011 and 2010 was $3,018,182
	and $3,922,014, respectively. These amounts do not reflect
	actual cash distributions to Mr. Ferguson in respect of direct
	carried interest allocations during such periods, which were
	$2,185,306 and $1,204, respectively. For financial statement
	reporting purposes, compensation expense is equal to the sum of
	the carried interest distributions during the year and the
	change in the value of carried interest during the year related
	to unrealized investments. Such expense could also turn negative
	in the event of a reduction of previously accrued allocation of
	carried interest due to negative adjustments in the fair value
	of fund investments. The ultimate amounts of actual carried
	interest that may be realized and received by our named
	executive officers may be more or less than the amounts
	indicated and is unknown at this time. The amounts for 2011 and
	2010 in the table also include $20,764 and $1,138,
	respectively, representing the portion of the carried
	interest-related distributions from the Parent Entities received
	by Mr. Ferguson that were subject to forfeiture as
	described above under  Compensation Discussion
	and Analysis  Compensation Elements 
	Carried Interest, as well as $6,125 and $6,125,
	respectively, representing our 401(k) matching contributions for
	such periods.





	 


	Please see Cash Distribution Policy for information
	regarding cash distributions by the Parent Entities to each of
	our named executive officers in respect of their equity
	interests in our firm during 2011 and 2010.

	not entitled to any additional payments or benefits upon
	termination of employment, upon a change in control of our
	company or upon retirement, death or disability.


	 


	If at any time before March 28, 2013,
	Ms. Friedmans employment is terminated by her for
	Good Reason and we could not have terminated her for Cause or
	her employment is terminated by us without Cause,
	Ms. Friedman will be entitled to a cash severance in an
	amount equal to (x) the unpaid portion of her annual base
	salary from the termination date through March 28, 2013,
	(y) the difference between the bonuses guaranteed to
	Ms. Friedman and bonuses paid to her and (z) if
	terminated without Cause within 18 months of March 28,
	2011, $2,500,000 unless there has been a vesting date of our
	shares listed on a stock exchange; provided, however, that the
	aggregate amount of severance payable will be in no event less
	than 25% of her annual base salary. If at any time on or after
	March 28, 2013, Ms. Friedmans employment is
	terminated by her for Good Reason and we could not have
	terminated her for Cause or her employment is terminated by us
	without Cause, we will pay severance to Ms. Friedman in an
	amount equal to 25% of her annual base salary. If
	Ms. Friedmans employment is terminated other than by
	her for Good Reason or by us for any reason with 30 days
	notice, she is entitled to accrued but unpaid salary through the
	effective date of such termination. For the purpose of the
	employment agreement with Ms. Friedman, Good
	Reason includes (1) a material breach of the
	employment agreement by us or (2) a significant, sustained
	reduction in or adverse modification of the nature and scope of
	Ms. Friedmans authority, duties and privileges, in
	each case only if such Good Reason has not been corrected or
	cured by us within 30 days after we have received written
	notice from Ms. Friedman of her intent to terminate her
	employment for Good Reason; and Cause includes
	(1) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
	performance of the duties required of Ms. Friedman under
	the employment agreement; (2) willful conduct that
	Ms. Friedman knows is materially injurious to us or any of
	our affiliates; (3) breach of any material provision of the
	employment agreement; (4) Ms. Friedmans
	conviction of any felony or Ms. Friedman entering into a
	plea bargain or settlement admitting guilt for any felony;
	(5) Ms. Friedmans being the subject of any order
	by the Securities and Exchange Commission for any securities
	violation or; (6) Ms. Friedmans discussing our
	fundraising efforts or any fund vehicle that has not had a final
	closing of commitments with any member of the press.




	245








	 






	 



	If Ms. Friedmans employment with us was terminated by
	her for Good Reason and we could not have terminated her for
	Cause or her employment was terminated by us without Cause on
	December 30, 2011, she would have been entitled to a cash
	severance payment of $4,416,539. Ms. Friedman is not
	entitled to any additional payments or benefits upon a change in
	control of our company or upon retirement, death or disability.


	 


	Ms. Friedman is subject to a covenant not to disclose our
	confidential information at any time and may not discuss our
	fundraising efforts or the name of any fund that has not had a
	final closing with any member of the press. Ms. Friedman is
	also subject to covenants not to compete with us and not to
	solicit our employees or customers during her employment term
	and for six months following termination of her employment for
	any reason without our prior written consent. She is also
	subject to a covenant not to breach any confidentiality
	agreements or non-solicitation agreements with any former
	employer. We have no liability in the event that
	Ms. Friedmans provision of services to us violates
	any non-compete provision she had with her former employer.


	 





	Founders
	Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements





	 


	In February 2001, we entered into non-competition agreements
	with each of our founders in connection with the investment in
	our firm by CalPERS. The following is a description of the
	material terms of the non-competition agreements, the terms of
	which are substantially identical for each of our founders.


	 



	Non-Competition.

	  Each founder agreed that
	during the period he is a controlling partner (as defined in the
	non-competition agreement) and for the period of three years
	thereafter (the Restricted Period), he will not
	engage in any business or activity that is competitive with our
	business.


	 



	Non-Solicitation of Carlyle Employees.

	  Each
	founder agreed that during the Restricted Period he will not
	solicit any of our employees, or employees of our subsidiaries,
	to leave their employment with us or otherwise terminate or
	cease or materially modify their relationship with us, or employ
	or engage any such employee.


	 



	Non-Solicitation of Clients.

	  In addition,
	during the Restricted Period each founder will not solicit any
	of the investors of the funds we advise to invest in any funds
	or activities that are competitive with our businesses.


	 



	Confidentiality.

	  During the Restricted Period,
	each founder is required to protect and only use
	proprietary information that relates to our business
	in accordance with strict restrictions placed by us on its use
	and disclosure. Each founder agreed that during the Restricted
	Period he will not disclose any of the proprietary information,
	except (1) as required by his duties on behalf of Carlyle
	or with our consent, or (2) as required by virtue of
	subpoena, court or governmental agency order or as otherwise
	required by law or (3) to a court, mediator or arbitrator
	in connection with any dispute between such founder and us.


	 



	Investment Activities.

	  During the Restricted
	Period, each founder has agreed that he will not pursue or
	otherwise seek to develop any investment opportunities under
	active consideration by Carlyle.


	 



	Specific Performance.

	  In the case of any
	breach of the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality
	and investment activity limitation provisions, each founder
	agrees that we will be entitled to seek equitable relief in the
	form of specific performance and injunctive relief.


	 





	Employment
	Agreement with Ms. Friedman





	 


	We have entered into an employment agreement with
	Ms. Friedman pursuant to which she serves as our chief
	financial officer. The employment term is indefinite and lasts
	until Ms. Friedmans employment is terminated pursuant
	to the terms of the employment agreement.


	 


	Ms. Friedman is currently entitled to receive an annual
	base salary of $275,000, which may be increased from time to
	time by us. For calendar years 2011 and 2012, Ms. Friedman
	is entitled to a





	246








	 






	 



	guaranteed minimum bonus of $1,725,000. For calendar years
	following 2012, she will be paid bonuses at our discretion. The
	provisions of Ms. Friedmans employment agreement
	pertaining to termination of employment and covenants to which
	she is subject are described above under
	 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
	in Control.


	 





	Equity
	Incentive Plan





	 


	The board of directors of our general partner has adopted The
	Carlyle Group L.P. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity
	Incentive Plan) before the effective date of this
	offering. The following description of the Equity Incentive Plan
	is not complete and is qualified by reference to the full text
	of the Equity Incentive Plan, which will be filed as an exhibit
	to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a
	part. The Equity Incentive Plan will be a source of new
	equity-based awards permitting us to grant to our senior Carlyle
	professionals, employees, directors of our general partner and
	consultants non-qualified options, unit appreciation rights,
	common units, restricted common units, deferred restricted
	common units, phantom restricted common units and other awards
	based on our common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units, to which we collectively refer to as our
	units.


	 



	Administration.

	  The board of directors of our
	general partner will administer the Equity Incentive Plan.
	However, the board of directors of our general partner may
	delegate such authority, including to a committee or
	subcommittee of the board of directors, and the board has
	effected such a delegation to a committee comprising
	Messrs. Conway, DAniello and Rubenstein. We refer to
	the board of directors of our general partner or the committee
	or subcommittee thereof to whom authority to administer the
	Equity Incentive Plan has been delegated, as the case may be, as
	the Administrator. The Administrator will determine
	who will receive awards under the Equity Incentive Plan, as well
	as the form of the awards, the number of units underlying the
	awards and the terms and conditions of the awards consistent
	with the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan. The Administrator
	will have full authority to interpret and administer the Equity
	Incentive Plan, which determinations will be final and binding
	on all parties concerned.


	 



	Units Subject to the Equity Incentive
	Plan.

	  The total number of our common units and
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units which are initially available
	for future grants under the Equity Incentive Plan is 30,450,000.
	Beginning in 2013, the aggregate number of common units and
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units available for future grants
	under our Equity Incentive Plan will be increased on the first
	day of each fiscal year during its term by the number of units
	equal to the positive difference, if any, of (a) 10% of the
	aggregate number of common units and Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units outstanding on the last day of the immediately
	preceding fiscal year (excluding Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by The Carlyle Group L.P. or its wholly-owned
	subsidiaries) minus (b) the aggregate number of common
	units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units otherwise available
	for future grants under our Equity Incentive Plan as of such
	date (unless the Administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan
	should decide to increase the number of common units and Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units available for future grants under the
	plan by a lesser amount). Accordingly, on the first day of each
	such fiscal year, the aggregate number of common units and
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units available for future grants
	under our Equity Incentive Plan will reload to 10%
	of the aggregate number of common units and Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units outstanding on the last day of the immediately
	preceding fiscal year (excluding Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by The Carlyle Group L.P. or its wholly-owned
	subsidiaries). We will reserve for issuance the number of units
	necessary to satisfy the maximum number of units that may be
	issued under the Equity Incentive Plan. The units underlying any
	award granted under the Equity Incentive Plan that expire,
	terminate or are cancelled (other than in consideration of a
	payment) without being settled in units will again become
	available for awards under the Equity Incentive Plan.


	 



	Options and Unit Appreciation Rights.

	  The
	Administrator may award non-qualified options under the Equity
	Incentive Plan. Options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan
	will become vested and exercisable at such times and upon such
	terms and conditions as may be determined by the Administrator
	at the time of grant, but an option generally will not be
	exercisable for a period of





	247








	 






	 



	more than 10 years after it is granted. To the extent permitted
	by the Administrator, the exercise price of an option may be
	paid in cash or its equivalent, in units having a fair market
	value equal to the aggregate option exercise price partly in
	cash and partly in units and satisfying such other requirements
	as may be imposed by the Administrator or through the delivery
	of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell units obtained
	upon the exercise of the option and to deliver promptly to us an
	amount out of the proceeds of the sale equal to the aggregate
	option exercise price for the common units being purchased or
	through net settlement in units.


	 


	The Administrator may grant unit appreciation rights independent
	of or in conjunction with an option. Each unit appreciation
	right granted independent of a unit option shall entitle a
	participant upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the
	excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of
	one unit over (B) the exercise price per unit, multiplied
	by (ii) the number of units covered by the unit
	appreciation right, and each unit appreciation right granted in
	conjunction with an option will entitle a participant to
	surrender to us the option and to receive such amount. Payment
	will be made in units

	and/or

	cash
	(any common unit valued at fair market value), as determined by
	the Administrator.


	 



	Other Equity-Based Awards.

	  The Administrator,
	in its sole discretion, may grant or sell units, restricted
	units, deferred restricted units, phantom restricted units and
	other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference
	to, or are otherwise based on the fair value of, our units. Any
	of these other equity-based awards may be in such form, and
	dependent on such conditions, as the Administrator determines,
	including without limitation the right to receive, or vest with
	respect to, one or more units (or the equivalent cash value of
	such units) upon the completion of a specified period of
	service, the occurrence of an event

	and/or

	the
	attainment of performance objectives. The Administrator may in
	its discretion determine whether other equity-based awards will
	be payable in cash, units or a combination of both cash and
	units.


	 



	Adjustments Upon Certain Events.

	  In the event
	of any change in the outstanding units by reason of any unit
	distribution or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger,
	consolidation, spin-off, combination, combination or transaction
	or exchange of units or other corporate exchange, or any
	distribution to holders of units other than regular cash
	dividends, or any transaction similar to the foregoing, the
	Administrator in its sole discretion and without liability to
	any person will make such substitution or adjustment, if any, as
	it deems to be equitable, as to (i) the number or kind of
	units or other securities issued or available for future grant
	under our Equity Incentive Plan or pursuant to outstanding
	awards, (ii) the option price or exercise price of any
	option or unit appreciation right

	and/or

	(iii) any other affected terms of such awards.


	 



	Change in Control.

	  In the event of a change in
	control (as defined in the Equity Incentive Plan), the Equity
	Incentive Plan provides that the Administrator may, but shall
	not be obligated to (A) accelerate, vest or cause the
	restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of an
	award, (B) cancel awards for fair value (which, in the case
	of options or unit appreciation rights, shall be equal to the
	excess, if any, of the fair market value of a unit at the time
	of such change in control over the corresponding exercise price
	of the option or unit appreciation right), (C) provide for
	the issuance of substitute awards that will substantially
	preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards
	previously granted under the Equity Incentive Plan as determined
	by the Administrator in its sole discretion or (D) provide
	that, with respect to any awards that are options or unit
	appreciation rights, for a period of at least 15 days prior
	to the change in control, such options and unit appreciation
	rights will be exercisable as to all units subject thereto and
	that upon the occurrence of the change in control, such options
	and unit appreciation rights will terminate.


	 



	Transferability.

	  Unless otherwise determined
	by our Administrator, no award granted under the plan will be
	transferable or assignable by a participant in the plan, other
	than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.


	 



	Amendment, Termination and Term.

	  The
	Administrator may amend or terminate the Equity Incentive Plan,
	but no amendment or termination shall be made without the
	consent of a participant, if such action would materially
	diminish any of the rights of the participant under any award





	248








	 






	 



	theretofore granted to such participant under the Equity
	Incentive Plan; provided, however, that the Administrator may
	amend the Equity Incentive Plan

	and/or

	any
	outstanding awards in such manner as it deems necessary to
	permit the Equity Incentive Plan

	and/or

	any
	outstanding awards to satisfy applicable requirements of the
	Internal Revenue Code or other applicable laws. The Equity
	Incentive Plan will have a term of 10 years.


	 





	IPO Date
	Equity Awards





	 


	At the time of this offering and under our Equity Incentive
	Plan, we have granted to our employees deferred restricted
	common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public
	offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately
	$375.3 million (17,056,935 deferred restricted common units) and
	phantom deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value
	based on the initial public offering price per common unit in
	this offering of approximately $8.0 million (362,875 phantom
	deferred restricted common units). We will settle the deferred
	restricted common units in The Carlyle Group L.P. common units
	and the phantom deferred restricted common units in cash. In
	addition, at the time of this offering, we have granted to our
	directors who are not employees of or advisors to Carlyle
	deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based
	on the initial public offering price per common unit in this

	restricted common units). See Management 
	Director Compensation.


	 





	Vesting;
	Minimum Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer
	Restrictions





	 





	Vesting
	and Delivery





	 


	All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units received by our
	founders, CalPERS and Mubadala as part of the reorganization are
	fully vested. All of the Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	received by our other existing owners in exchange for their
	interests in carried interest owned at the fund level relating
	to investments made by our carry funds prior to the date of
	Reorganization are fully vested. Of the remaining Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units received as part of the
	Reorganization by our other existing owners, 26.2% are fully
	vested and 73.8% are unvested. The unvested portion will vest
	in equal installments on each anniversary date of this offering
	for six years.


	 


	The deferred restricted common units issued to our employees at
	the time of this offering as described above under
	 IPO Date Equity Awards will generally
	vest in six annual equal installments on each anniversary
	date of this offering for six years. The phantom deferred units
	will vest and pay out in cash in three equal annual installments
	on each anniversary date of this offering for three years. The
	deferred restricted common units issued to our directors that
	are not employees of or advisors to Carlyle will vest in three
	equal installments on each anniversary date of this offering for
	three years.


	 





	Minimum
	Retained Ownership Requirements





	 


	Each holder of our Carlyle Holdings partnership units that is
	employed by us will be required to hold at least 25% of such
	units until one year following the termination of active service
	with us.


	 


	An existing owner who is our employee will generally forfeit all
	unvested partnership units once he or she is no longer in our
	employ. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the death or
	permanent disability of an existing owner all of his or her
	unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units held at that time
	will vest immediately. In addition, all vested and unvested
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by an existing owner
	that is employed by us will be immediately forfeited in the
	event his or her service is terminated for cause, or if such
	person materially breaches the non-solicitation provisions of

	Transfer
	Restrictions





	 


	Holders of our Carlyle Holdings partnership units (other than
	Mubadala and CalPERS), including our founders and our other
	senior Carlyle professionals, will be prohibited from
	transferring or exchanging any such units until the fifth
	anniversary of this offering without our consent. However, sales
	may occur prior to such time in firm-approved transactions or as
	part of a firm-approved plan or program. The Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units held by Mubadala and CalPERS will be subject
	to transfer restrictions as described below under Common
	Units Eligible For Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements.


	 


	The deferred restricted common units will be non-transferable;
	provided, however, that any delivered common units will be
	immediately transferable subject to our generally applicable
	trading policies. The phantom deferred units will be
	non-transferable.

	CERTAIN
	RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS





	 



	The forms of the agreements described in this section are
	filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this
	prospectus forms a part, and the following descriptions are
	qualified by reference thereto.




	 




	Reorganization





	 


	Prior to this offering we have completed a series of
	transactions in connection with the Reorganization described in
	Organizational Structure whereby, among other
	things, our existing owners, including our inside directors and
	executive officers, have contributed their interests in the
	Parent Entities and certain equity interests they own in the
	general partners of our existing carry funds to the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships in exchange for Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units. In addition, certain existing and former
	owners of the Parent Entities, including our inside directors
	and executive officers, have a beneficial interest in
	investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such
	persons indirectly through the Parent Entities. In order to
	minimize the extent of third-party ownership interests in firm
	assets, prior to the completion of the offering, we have
	(i) distributed a portion of these interests (approximately
	$118.5 million as of December 31, 2011) to the
	beneficial owners so that they are held directly by such persons
	and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and
	(ii) restructured the remainder of these interests
	(approximately $84.8 million as of December 31,
	2011) so that they are reflected as non-controlling
	interests in our financial statements.


	 


	In addition, prior to the date of this offering the Parent
	Entities have also made a cash distribution of previously
	undistributed earnings to their owners totaling $28.0 million.



	 




	Tax
	Receivable Agreement





	 


	Limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, subject
	to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and
	transfer restrictions applicable to such limited partners as set
	forth in the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships, may on a quarterly basis, from and after the first
	anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering (subject
	to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common
	units on a

	one-for-one

	basis. In addition, subject to certain requirements, CalPERS
	will generally be permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for common units from and after the closing of
	this offering and Mubadala will generally be entitled to
	exchange Carlyle Holdings partnerships units for common units
	following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering.
	Any common units received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such
	exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in
	Common Units Eligible For Future Sale  Lock-Up
	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions
	and Common Units Eligible For Future Sale 
	Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS Transfer
	Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to the
	restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. Carlyle Holdings I L.P. intends to make an
	election under Section 754 of the Code effective for each
	taxable year in which an exchange of partnership units for
	common units occurs, which is expected to result in increases to
	the tax basis of the assets of Carlyle Holdings at the time of
	an exchange of partnership units. The exchanges are expected to
	result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and
	intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings. These increases in tax
	basis may reduce the amount of tax that certain of our
	subsidiaries, including Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which we
	refer to as, together with any successors thereto, the
	corporate taxpayers, would otherwise be required to
	pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also
	decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of
	certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to
	those capital assets. The IRS may challenge all or part of the
	tax basis increase and increased deductions, and a court could
	sustain such a challenge.


	 


	We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our
	existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate
	taxpayers to our existing owners of 85% of the amount of cash
	tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate





	251








	 






	 



	taxpayers realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an
	early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change
	in control, as discussed below) as a result of increases in tax
	basis and certain other tax benefits related to our entering
	into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits
	attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.
	This payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate
	taxpayers and not of Carlyle Holdings. The corporate taxpayers
	expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash tax savings, if
	any, in income tax they realize. For purposes of the tax
	receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be
	computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the
	corporate taxpayers (calculated with certain assumptions) to the
	amount of such taxes that the corporate taxpayers would have
	been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis
	of the assets of Carlyle Holdings as a result of the exchanges
	and had the corporate taxpayers not entered into the tax
	receivable agreement. The term of the tax receivable agreement
	will commence upon consummation of this offering and will
	continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or
	expired, unless the corporate taxpayers exercise their right to
	terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on
	the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement (as
	described in more detail below) or the corporate taxpayers
	breach any of their material obligations under the tax
	receivable agreement in which case all obligations generally
	will be accelerated and due as if the corporate taxpayers had
	exercised their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement.
	Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax
	receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the
	calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors.
	The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and
	timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will
	vary depending upon a number of factors, including:


	 












	 


	 



	the timing of exchanges

	  for instance, the
	increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair
	value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or
	amortizable assets of Carlyle Holdings at the time of each
	exchange;




	 




	 


	 



	the price of our common units at the time of the
	exchange

	  the increase in any tax deductions, as
	well as the tax basis increase in other assets, of Carlyle
	Holdings, is directly proportional to the price of our common
	units at the time of the exchange;




	 




	 


	 



	the extent to which such exchanges are
	taxable

	  if an exchange is not taxable for any
	reason, increased deductions will not be available; and




	 




	 


	 



	the amount and timing of our income

	  the
	corporate taxpayers will be required to pay 85% of the cash tax
	savings as and when realized, if any. If the corporate taxpayers
	do not have taxable income, the corporate taxpayers are not
	required (absent a change of control or other circumstances
	requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under
	the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no
	cash tax savings will have been realized. However, any cash tax
	savings that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax
	year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to
	generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The
	utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under
	the tax receivables agreement.




	 


	We anticipate that we will account for the effects of these
	increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax
	receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows:


	 












	 


	 


	we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the
	estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based
	on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the
	exchange;




	 




	 


	 


	to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full
	benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an
	analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation
	of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a
	valuation allowance; and




	 




	 


	 


	we will record 85% of the estimated realizable tax benefit
	(which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded
	valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under
	the tax receivable agreement and the remaining 15% of the
	estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to
	partners capital.






	252








	 






	 



	 


	All of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the
	date of the exchange will be included in net income. Similarly,
	the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will
	be included in net income.


	 


	We expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the
	tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle
	Holdings, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable
	agreement will be substantial. There may be a material negative
	effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies
	or otherwise, the payments under the tax receivable agreement
	exceed the actual cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers
	realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax
	receivable agreement

	and/or

	distributions to the corporate taxpayers by Carlyle Holdings are
	not sufficient to permit the corporate taxpayers to make
	payments under the tax receivable agreement after they have paid
	taxes. Late payments under the tax receivable agreement
	generally will accrue interest at an uncapped rate equal to
	LIBOR plus 500 basis points. The payments under the tax
	receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing
	owners continued ownership of us.


	 


	In addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that upon
	certain changes of control, the corporate taxpayers (or
	their successors) obligations with respect to exchanged or
	acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after
	such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions,
	including that the corporate taxpayers would have sufficient
	taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the
	increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits
	related to entering into the tax receivable agreement.


	 


	Furthermore, the corporate taxpayers may elect to terminate the
	tax receivable agreement early by making an immediate payment
	equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax
	savings. In determining such anticipated future cash tax
	savings, the tax receivable agreement includes several
	assumptions, including (i) that any Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed
	exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time
	of termination, (ii) the corporate taxpayers will have
	sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully
	realize all potential tax savings, (iii) the tax rates for
	future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at
	the time of termination and (iv) certain

	non-amortizable

	assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods. In
	addition, the present value of such anticipated future cash tax
	savings are discounted at a rate equal to LIBOR plus
	100 basis points. Assuming that the market value a common
	unit were to be equal to the initial public offering price per
	common unit in this offering and that LIBOR were to be 0.24%, we
	estimate that the aggregate amount of these termination payments
	would be approximately $915.2 million if the corporate
	taxpayers were to exercise their termination right immediately
	following this offering.


	 


	As a result of the change in control provisions and the early
	termination right, the corporate taxpayers could be required to
	make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are
	greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual
	cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers realize in respect
	of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.
	In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable
	agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our
	liquidity.


	 


	Decisions made by our existing owners in the course of running
	our business may influence the timing and amount of payments
	that are received by an exchanging or selling existing owner
	under the tax receivable agreement. For example, the earlier
	disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition
	transaction generally will accelerate payments under the tax
	receivable agreement and increase the present value of such
	payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or
	acquisition transaction will increase an existing owners
	tax liability without giving rise to any rights of an existing
	owner to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement.


	 


	Payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the
	tax reporting positions that we will determine. The corporate
	taxpayers will not be reimbursed for any payments previously
	made under the tax receivable agreement if a tax basis increase
	is successfully challenged by the IRS.





	253








	 






	 



	As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made
	under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the corporate
	taxpayers cash tax savings.


	 


	In the event that The Carlyle Group L.P. or any of its
	wholly-owned subsidiaries become taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, these entities will also
	be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement
	on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate
	taxpayers.



	 




	Registration
	Rights Agreements





	 


	We will enter into one or more registration rights agreements
	with our existing owners, other than CalPERS and Mubadala,
	pursuant to which we will grant them, their affiliates and
	certain of their transferees the right, under certain
	circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us
	to register under the Securities Act common units delivered in
	exchange for Carlyle Holdings partnership units or common units
	(and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or
	exercisable for our common units) otherwise held by them. Under
	the registration rights agreements, we will agree to register
	the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for common
	units by our existing owners. In addition, TCG Carlyle Global
	Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle
	professionals, has the right to request that we register the
	sale of common units held by our existing owners an unlimited
	number of times and may require us to make available shelf
	registration statements permitting sales of common units into
	the market from time to time over an extended period. In
	addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C. will have the
	ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in
	respect of common units held by our existing owners in
	connection with registered offerings requested by other
	registration rights holders or initiated by us.


	 


	In addition, in accordance with the terms of the subscription
	agreements which govern their respective investments in our
	business, we will enter into separate registration rights
	agreements with CalPERS and Mubadala. See Common Units
	Eligible For Future Sale  Registration Rights.



	 




	Carlyle
	Holdings Partnership Agreements





	 


	As a result of the Reorganization and the Offering Transactions,
	The Carlyle Group L.P. is a holding partnership and, through
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, holds equity interests in Carlyle
	Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle
	Holdings III L.P., which we refer to collectively as
	Carlyle Holdings. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. will be the sole general partner of each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Accordingly, The
	Carlyle Group L.P. will operate and control all of the business
	and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings
	and its operating entity subsidiaries, conduct our business.
	Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The Carlyle Group L.P.
	will have unilateral control over all of the affairs and
	decision making of Carlyle Holdings. Furthermore, the
	wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P. cannot be
	removed as the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships without their approval. Because our general
	partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., will operate and
	control the business of The Carlyle Group L.P., the board of
	directors and officers of our general partner will accordingly
	be responsible for all operational and administrative decisions
	of Carlyle Holdings and the

	day-to-day

	management of Carlyle Holdings business.


	 


	Pursuant to the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. which are the general partners of those partnerships have
	the right to determine when distributions will be made to the
	partners of Carlyle Holdings and the amount of any such
	distributions. If a distribution is authorized, such
	distribution will be made to the partners of Carlyle Holdings
	pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective
	partnership interests.


	 


	Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will have an identical
	number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms
	Carlyle Holdings partnership unit or
	partnership unit in/of Carlyle Holdings to refer,
	collectively, to a partnership unit in each of the Carlyle
	Holdings





	254








	 






	 



	partnerships. The holders of partnership units in Carlyle
	Holdings, including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned
	subsidiaries, will incur U.S. federal, state and local
	income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable
	income of Carlyle Holdings. Net profits and net losses of
	Carlyle Holdings generally will be allocated to its partners
	(including The Carlyle Group L.P.s wholly-owned
	subsidiaries) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of
	their respective partnership interests. The partnership
	agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will provide for
	cash distributions, which we refer to as tax
	distributions, to the partners of such partnerships if the
	wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P. which are
	the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership
	will give rise to taxable income for its partners. Generally,
	these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate
	of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable
	to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the
	highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and
	local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate
	resident in New York, New York (taking into account the
	non-deductibility of certain expenses and the character of our
	income). Tax distributions will be made only to the extent all
	distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were
	insufficient to cover such tax liabilities.


	 


	Our existing owners received Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	in the Reorganization in exchange for the contribution of their
	equity interests in our operating subsidiaries to Carlyle
	Holdings. Subject to the applicable vesting and minimum retained
	ownership requirements and transfer restrictions, these
	partnership units may be exchanged for The Carlyle Group L.P.
	common units as described under  Exchange
	Agreement below. (See Management 
	Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer
	Restrictions for a discussion of the vesting and minimum
	retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions
	applicable to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units.)


	 


	The partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	contain non-solicitation provisions that provide that during the
	term of his or her employment and for a period of one year after
	the effective date of his or her withdrawal, resignation or
	expulsion, each existing owner that is employed by us shall not,
	directly or indirectly, whether alone or in concert with other
	persons, solicit any person employed by us or our affiliates to
	abandon such employment, hire any person who is, or within the
	prior year was, employed by us or solicit any Carlyle fund
	investor for the purpose of obtaining funds or inducing such
	fund investor to make an investment which is sponsored or
	promoted by such person.


	 


	The partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	also provide that substantially all of our expenses, including
	substantially all expenses solely incurred by or attributable to
	The Carlyle Group L.P. such as expenses incurred in connection
	with this offering but not including obligations incurred under
	the tax receivable agreement by The Carlyle Group L.P. or its
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, income tax expenses of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. or its wholly-owned subsidiaries and payments on
	indebtedness incurred by The Carlyle Group L.P. or its
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be borne by Carlyle Holdings.



	 




	Exchange
	Agreement





	 


	In connection with the Reorganization, we have entered into an
	exchange agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships. Under the exchange agreement, subject to
	the applicable vesting and minimum retained ownership
	requirements and transfer restrictions, each such holder of
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units (and certain transferees
	thereof) may up to four times a year, from and after the first
	anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering (subject
	to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange these
	partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this





	255








	 






	 



	offering. Any common units received by Mubadala and CalPERS in
	any such exchange during the applicable restricted periods
	described in Common Units Eligible For Future
	Sale  Lock-Up Arrangements  Mubadala
	Transfer Restrictions and Common Units Eligible For
	Future Sale  Lock-Up Arrangements 
	CalPERS Transfer Restrictions, respectively, would be
	subject to the restrictions described in such sections. Under
	the exchange agreement, to effect an exchange a holder of
	partnership units in Carlyle Holdings must simultaneously
	exchange one partnership unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. will hold, through wholly
	owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units equal to the number of common units that The Carlyle Group
	L.P. has issued. As a holder exchanges its Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units, The Carlyle Group L.P.s indirect
	interest in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships will be
	correspondingly increased. The Carlyle Group L.P. common units
	received upon such an exchange would be subject to all
	restrictions, if any, applicable to the exchanged Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units, including minimum retained ownership
	requirements, vesting requirements and transfer restrictions.
	See Management  Vesting; Minimum Retained
	Ownership Requirements and Transfer Restrictions and
	 Carlyle Holdings Partnership Agreements
	above.



	 




	Firm Use
	of Our Founders Private Aircraft





	 


	In the normal course of business, our personnel have made use of
	aircraft owned by entities controlled by Messrs. Conway,
	DAniello and Rubenstein. Messrs. Conway,
	DAniello and Rubenstein paid for their purchases of the
	aircraft and bear all operating, personnel and maintenance costs
	associated with their operation for personal use. Payment by us
	for the business use of these aircraft by Messrs. Conway,
	DAniello and Rubenstein and other of our personnel is made
	at market rates, which totaled $45,747, $36,743 and $506,011
	during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for Mr. Conway,
	$36,890, $37,468 and $523,591 during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
	respectively, for Mr. DAniello, and $1,846,879,
	$4,750,500 and $4,050,375 during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
	respectively for Mr. Rubenstein. We also made payments for
	services and supplies relating to business use flight operations
	to managers of the airplanes of Messrs. DAniello,
	Conway and Rubenstein, which aggregated $639,124, $517,041 and
	$352,039 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in the case
	of Mr. DAniellos airplane, $1,248,440, $459,526
	and $340,219 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in the
	case of Mr. Conways airplane, and $1,456,871 during
	2011 in the case of Mr. Rubensteins airplane.


	 


	As the co-founder primarily responsible for, among other things,
	maintaining strong relationships with and securing future
	commitments from Carlyles investors, particularly outside
	the United States Mr. Rubenstein has an exceptionally
	rigorous travel schedule. For example, in 2011,
	Mr. Rubenstein traveled extensively outside of Washington
	for more than 250 days, visiting 24 countries and
	33 non-U.S. cities, many of which he visited on multiple
	occasions.


	 





	Investments
	In and Alongside Carlyle Funds





	 


	Our directors and executive officers are permitted to co-invest
	their own capital alongside our carry funds and we encourage our
	professionals to do so because we believe that investing in and
	alongside our funds further aligns the interests of our
	professionals with those of our fund investors and with our own.
	Co-investments are investments in investment vehicles or other
	assets on the same terms and conditions as those available to
	the applicable fund, except that these co-investments are not
	subject to management fees or carried interest. These
	investments are funded with our professionals own
	after tax cash and not with deferral of management
	or incentive fees. Co-investors are responsible for their
	pro-rata share of partnership and other general and
	administrative fees and expenses. In addition, our directors and
	executive officers are permitted to invest their own capital
	directly in investment funds we advise, in most instances not
	subject to management fees, incentive fees or carried interest.
	Since our inception through December 31, 2011, our senior
	Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other
	professionals have invested or committed to invest in excess of
	$4 billion in or alongside our funds, placing significant
	amounts of their own capital at risk. In 2011 alone, our
	founders invested an aggregate of approximately
	$381 million in and alongside our





	256








	 






	 



	funds. We intend to continue our co-investment program following
	this offering and we expect that our senior Carlyle
	professionals will continue to invest significant amounts of
	their own capital in and alongside the funds that we manage.


	 


	The amount invested in and alongside our investment funds during
	2011 by our directors and executive officers (and their family
	members and investment vehicles), including amounts funded
	pursuant to third party capital commitments assumed by such
	persons, was $185,364,663 for Mr. Conway, $98,765,352 for
	Mr. DAniello, $98,845,209 for Mr. Rubenstein,
	$14,004,680 for Mr. Youngkin, $880,163 for
	Ms. Friedman and $467,634 for Mr. Ferguson. The amount
	of distributions, including profits and return of capital, to
	our directors and executive officers (and their family members
	and investment vehicles) during 2011 in respect of previous
	investments was $98,269,721 for Mr. Conway, $84,291,376 for
	Mr. DAniello, $62,506,247 for Mr. Rubenstein,
	$14,533,609 for Mr. Youngkin, $17,847 for Ms. Friedman
	and $593,800 for Mr. Ferguson. In addition, our directors
	and executive officers (and their family members and investment
	vehicles) made additional commitments to our investment funds
	during 2011. In the aggregate, our directors and executive
	officers (and their family members and investment vehicles) made
	commitments to new carry funds and additional commitments to our
	open-end funds during 2011 of approximately $368 million,
	and the total unfunded commitment of our directors and executive
	officers (and their family members and investment vehicles) to
	our investment funds as of December 31, 2011 was
	$263,226,922 for Mr. Conway, $201,265,778 for
	Mr. DAniello, $201,305,529 for Mr. Rubenstein,
	$25,061,116 for Mr. Youngkin, $1,790,938 for
	Ms. Friedman and $1,083,859 for Mr. Ferguson. In
	addition, certain of the nominees to the board of directors of
	our general partner are employees of or advisors to Carlyle and
	also own investments in and alongside our investment funds.
	During 2011, Messrs. Hance and Mathias invested $1,223,976
	and $208,587, respectively, in and alongside our investment
	funds and received distributions in respect of previous
	investments, including profits and return of capital, of
	$1,478,654 and $209,041, respectively. The opportunity to invest
	in and alongside our funds is available to all of our senior
	Carlyle professionals and to those of our employees whom we have
	determined to have a status that reasonably permits us to offer
	them these types of investments in compliance with applicable
	laws. Our directors and officers may also purchase outstanding
	interests in our investment funds, whereupon the interests may
	no longer be subject to management fees or carried interest in
	some cases. See Business  Structure and
	Operation of Our Investment Funds  Capital Invested
	in and Alongside Our Investment Funds.


	 




	Other
	Transactions




	 


	Mr. Hance, a nominee to the board of directors of our
	general partner, is an Operating Executive of Carlyle and
	received an operating executive fee in respect of his service in
	such capacity of $250,000 for the year ended December 31,
	2011. Mr. Mathias, a nominee to the board of directors of
	our general partner, is a Managing Director of Carlyle and
	received total compensation in respect of his service in such
	capacity of $1,550,000 for the year ended December 31,
	2011, which included a salary of $250,000 and a bonus of
	$1,300,000. Mr. Mathias is also allocated carried interest
	at the level of the general partners of our investment funds.
	For the year ended December 31, 2011, Mr. Mathias
	received distributions of $91,016 in respect of such carried
	interest.



	 






	Statement
	of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons





	 


	Prior to the completion of this offering, the board of directors
	of our general partner will adopt a written statement of policy
	regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to
	as our related person policy. Our related person
	policy requires that a related person (as defined as
	in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of

	Regulation S-K)

	must promptly disclose to the General Counsel of our general
	partner any related person transaction (defined as
	any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us
	under Item 404(a) of

	Regulation S-K

	in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount
	involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or
	will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all
	material facts with respect thereto. The General Counsel will
	then promptly communicate that information to our conflict
	committee or another





	257








	 






	 



	independent body of the board of directors of our general
	partner. No related person transaction will be executed without
	the approval or ratification of our conflict committee or
	another independent body of the board of directors of our
	general partner. It is our policy that directors interested in a
	related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote
	of a related person transaction in which they have an interest.



	 




	Indemnification
	of Directors and Officers





	 


	Under our partnership agreement we generally will indemnify the
	following persons, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from
	and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or
	several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses),
	judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
	amounts on an after tax basis: our general partner, any
	departing general partner, any person who is or was a tax
	matters partner, officer or director of our general partner or
	any departing general partner, any officer or director of our
	general partner or any departing general partner who is or was
	serving at the request of our general partner or any departing
	general partner as an officer, director, employee, member,
	partner, tax matters partner, agent, fiduciary or trustee of
	another person, any person who is named in the registration
	statement of which this prospectus forms a part as being or
	about to become a director or a person performing similar
	functions of our general partner and any person our general
	partner in its sole discretion designates as an
	indemnitee for purposes of our partnership
	agreement. We have agreed to provide this indemnification unless
	there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of
	competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in
	bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We have
	also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal
	proceedings. Any indemnification under these provisions will
	only be out of our assets. The general partner will not be
	personally liable for, or have any obligation to contribute or
	loan funds or assets to us to enable it to effectuate,
	indemnification. We may purchase insurance against liabilities
	asserted against and expenses incurred by persons for our
	activities, regardless of whether we would have the power to
	indemnify the person against liabilities under our partnership
	agreement.


	 


	In addition, we will enter into indemnification agreements with
	each of our executive officers and directors. The
	indemnification agreements will provide the executive officers
	and directors with contractual rights to indemnification,
	expense advancement and reimbursement, to the fullest extent
	permitted by applicable law. We also indemnify such persons to
	the extent they serve at our request as directors, officers,
	employees or other agents of any other entity, such as an
	investment vehicle advised by us or its portfolio companies.

	PRINCIPAL
	UNITHOLDERS





	 


	The following table sets forth information regarding the
	beneficial ownership of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units and
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units by each person known to us to
	beneficially own more than 5% of any class of the outstanding
	voting securities of The Carlyle Group L.P., each of the
	directors, director nominees and named executive officers of our
	general partner and all directors and executive officers of our
	general partner as a group. As described under Material
	Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement, we are managed by our general partner, Carlyle
	Management L.L.C., and the limited partners of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. do not presently have the right to elect or remove our
	general partner or its directors. Accordingly, we do not believe
	the common units are voting securities as such term
	is defined in

	Rule 12b-2

	under the Exchange Act.


	 


	The number of common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units outstanding and percentage of beneficial ownership before
	the Offering Transactions set forth below is based on the number
	of our common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units to be
	issued and outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of
	this offering after giving effect to the Reorganization. The
	number of common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	and percentage of beneficial ownership after the Offering
	Transactions set forth below is based on common units and
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units to be issued and outstanding
	immediately after the Offering Transactions (including Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units to be issued to wholly-owned
	subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P.). Beneficial ownership is
	determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC.

	CONFLICTS
	OF INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES





	 




	Conflicts
	of Interest




	 


	Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a
	result of the relationships between our general partner or its
	affiliates (including each partys respective owners) on
	the one hand, and our partnership, its subsidiaries or our
	limited partners, on the other hand.


	 


	Whenever a potential conflict arises between our general partner
	or its affiliates or associates, on the one hand, and us, our
	subsidiaries or any other partner, on the other hand, our
	general partner will resolve that conflict. Our partnership
	agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary
	duties that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to
	our common unitholders and the partnership at law or in equity.
	Accordingly, our general partner will only be subject to the
	contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement and to
	the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
	Our partnership agreement also limits the liability of our
	general partner and restricts the remedies available to common
	unitholders for actions taken that without those limitations
	might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duties).


	 


	Under our partnership agreement, our general partner will not be
	in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or
	its duties to us or our common unitholders if the resolution of
	the conflict is:


	 












	 


	 


	approved by the conflicts committee, although our general
	partner is not obligated to seek such approval;




	 




	 


	 


	approved by the vote of a majority of the voting power of our
	voting units, excluding any voting units owned by our general
	partner and any of its affiliates, although our general partner
	is not obligated to seek such approval; or




	 




	 


	 


	approved by our general partner in good faith as determined
	under the partnership agreement.




	 


	Our general partner may, but is not required to, seek the
	approval of such resolution from the conflicts committee or the
	holders of our voting units. If our general partner does not
	seek approval from the conflicts committee or the holders of our
	voting units, any resolution or course of action taken by it
	with respect to the conflict of interest shall be conclusively
	deemed approved by us and our partners and not a breach of our
	partnership agreement or any duty (including any fiduciary
	duties) unless our general partner subjectively believes that
	the resolution or course of action is opposed to the best
	interests of the partnership. In any proceeding brought by or on
	behalf of any limited partner or us or any other person bound by
	the partnership agreement, the person bringing or prosecuting
	such proceeding will have the burden of providing that the
	general partner subjectively believed that such resolution or
	course of action was opposed to the best interests of the
	partnership. Unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically
	provided for in our partnership agreement, our general partner
	or the conflicts committee may consider any factors it
	determines in good faith to consider when resolving a conflict.


	 


	The three bullet points above establish the procedures by which
	conflict of interest situations are to be resolved pursuant to
	our partnership agreement. These procedures benefit our general
	partner by providing our general partner with significant
	flexibility with respect to its ability to make decisions and
	pursue actions involving conflicts of interest. Given the
	significant flexibility afforded our general partner to resolve
	conflicts of interest  including that our general
	partner has the right to determine not to seek the approval of
	the common unitholders with respect to the resolution of such
	conflicts  the general partner may resolve conflicts
	of interest pursuant to the partnership agreement in a manner
	that common unitholders may not believe to be in their or in our
	best interests. Neither our common unitholders nor we will have
	any recourse against our general partner if our general partner
	satisfies one of the standards described in the three bullet
	points above.




	260








	 






	 



	In addition to the provisions relating to conflicts of interest,
	our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or
	consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates
	that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with
	fiduciary duties or other applicable law. For example, our
	partnership agreement provides that when our general partner, in
	its capacity as our general partner, is permitted to or required
	to make a decision in its sole discretion or
	discretion or pursuant to any provision of our
	partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of
	good faith, then our general partner will not be
	subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider
	only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own
	interests, and will have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or
	otherwise) to give any consideration to any interest of or
	factors affecting us or any limited partners and will not be
	subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership
	agreement or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise.
	These modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted
	by Delaware law. Hence, we and our common unitholders will only
	have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our general
	partner if our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant
	to our partnership agreement. Unless our general partner
	breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement,
	we and our common unitholders will not have any recourse against
	our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a
	manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties.
	Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of the obligations
	set forth in our partnership agreement, our partnership
	agreement provides that our general partner and its officers and
	directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders for
	errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has
	been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
	jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its
	officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or
	willful misconduct. These modifications are detrimental to the
	common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available
	to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations
	might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duty).


	 




	Potential
	Conflicts




	 


	Conflicts of interest could arise in the situations described
	below, among others.


	 





	Actions
	taken by our general partner may affect the amount of cash flow
	from operations to our common unitholders.





	 


	The amount of cash that is available for distribution to our
	common unitholders is affected by decisions of our general
	partner regarding such matters as:


	 












	 


	 


	the amount and timing of cash expenditures, including those
	relating to compensation;




	 




	 


	 


	the amount and timing of investments and dispositions;




	 




	 


	 


	levels of indebtedness;




	 




	 


	 


	tax matters;




	 




	 


	 


	levels of reserves; and




	 




	 


	 


	issuances of additional partnership securities.




	 


	In addition, borrowings by our partnership and our affiliates do
	not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner
	to our common unitholders. Our partnership agreement provides
	that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds from our general
	partner and its affiliates on terms agreed to by our general
	partner in good faith. Under our partnership agreement, those
	borrowings conclusively will be deemed to be in good faith and
	not a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty of the
	general partner if: (1) they are approved by the conflicts
	committee of our general partner or by the vote of a majority of
	the voting power of our voting units, excluding any voting units
	held by our general partner or any of its affiliates, in
	accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement or
	(2) they are otherwise approved by our general partner in
	good faith as determined under the partnership agreement account
	the totality of the relationships between the





	261








	 






	 



	parties involved (including other transactions that may be or
	have been particularly favorable or advantageous to us).


	 





	We
	will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for
	expenses.





	 


	We will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all
	costs incurred in managing and operating us, and our partnership
	agreement provides that our general partner will determine the
	expenses that are allocable to us.


	 





	Our
	general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our
	obligations.





	 


	Our general partner intends to limit its liability under
	contractual arrangements so that the other party has recourse
	only to our assets, and not against our general partner, its
	assets or its owners. Our partnership agreement provides that
	any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability
	or our liability is not a breach of our general partners
	fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable
	terms without the limitation on liability. The limitation on our
	general partners liability does not constitute a waiver of
	compliance with U.S. federal securities laws that would be
	void under Section 14 of the Securities Act.


	 





	Our
	common unitholders will have no right to enforce obligations of
	our general partner and its affiliates under agreements with
	us.





	 


	Any agreements between us on the one hand, and our general
	partner and its affiliates on the other, will not grant to the
	common unitholders, separate and apart from us, the right to
	enforce the obligations of our general partner and its
	affiliates in our favor.


	 





	Contracts
	between us, on the one hand, and our general partner and its
	affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of
	arms-length negotiations.





	 


	Our partnership agreement allows our general partner to
	determine in its sole discretion any amounts to reimburse itself
	or its affiliates for any costs or expenses incurred in
	connection with our activities. Our general partner may also
	enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its
	affiliates on our behalf. Neither the partnership agreement nor
	any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between
	us on the one hand, and our general partner and its affiliates
	on the other, are or will be the result of arms-length
	negotiations. Our general partner will determine the terms of
	any of these transactions entered into after this offering on
	terms that it agrees to in good faith as determined under our
	partnership agreement. Our general partner and its affiliates
	will have no obligation to permit us to use any facilities or
	assets of our general partner and its affiliates, except as may
	be provided in contracts entered into specifically dealing with
	that use. There will not be any obligation of our general
	partner and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this
	kind.


	 





	Our
	common units are subject to our general partners limited
	call right.





	 


	Our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase
	common units as provided in our partnership agreement or assign
	this right to one of its affiliates or to us. Our general
	partner may use its own discretion, free of fiduciary duty
	restrictions, in determining whether to exercise this right. As
	a result, a common unitholder may have his common units
	purchased from him at an undesirable time or price. See
	Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement  Limited Call Right.


	 





	We may
	choose not to retain separate counsel for ourselves or for the
	holders of common units.





	 


	Attorneys, independent accountants and others who will perform
	services for us are selected by our general partner or the
	conflicts committee, and may perform services for our general
	partner and its affiliates. We are not required to retain
	separate counsel for ourselves or the holders of our common
	units in the event of a conflict of interest between our general
	partner and its affiliates on the one hand, and us or the
	holders of our common units on the other.




	262








	 






	 






	Our
	general partners affiliates may compete with
	us.





	 


	The partnership agreement provides that our general partner will
	be restricted from engaging in any business activities other
	than activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us.
	The partnership agreement does not prohibit affiliates of the
	general partner, including its owners, from engaging in other
	business or activities, including those that might compete
	directly with us.


	 





	Certain
	of our subsidiaries have obligations to investors in our
	investment funds and may have obligations to other third parties
	that may conflict with your interests.





	 


	Our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our
	investment funds have certain duties and obligations to those
	funds and their investors and some of our subsidiaries may have
	contractual duties to other third parties. As a result, we
	expect to regularly take actions with respect to the allocation
	of investments among our investment funds (including funds that
	have different fee structures), the purchase or sale of
	investments in our investment funds, the structuring of
	investment transactions for those funds, the advice we provide
	or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and
	obligations. In addition, directors and officers of our general
	partner, our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives
	and other professionals have made personal investments in and
	alongside a variety of our investment funds, which may result in
	conflicts of interest among investors in our funds or our common
	unitholders regarding investment decisions for these funds. Some
	of these actions might at the same time adversely affect our
	near-term results of operations or cash flow.


	 





	U.S.
	federal income tax considerations of our partners may conflict
	with your interests.





	 


	Because our partners hold their Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units directly or through entities that are not subject to
	corporate income taxation and The Carlyle Group L.P. holds
	Carlyle Holdings partnership units through wholly-owned
	subsidiaries, at least one of which is subject to taxation as a
	corporation in the United States, conflicts may arise between
	our partners and The Carlyle Group L.P. relating to the
	selection and structuring of investments or other matters. Our
	limited partners will be deemed to expressly acknowledge that
	our general partner is under no obligation to consider the
	separate interests of our limited partners (including among
	other things the tax consequences to limited partners) in
	deciding whether to cause us to take (or decline to take) any
	actions.


	 




	Fiduciary
	Duties




	 


	Duties owed to common unitholders by our general partner are
	prescribed by law and our partnership agreement. The Delaware
	Limited Partnership Act provides that Delaware limited
	partnerships may in their partnership agreements expand,
	restrict or eliminate the duties (including fiduciary duties)
	otherwise owed by a general partner to limited partners and the
	partnership.


	 


	Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the
	fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed by our general
	partner to our common unitholders and the partnership at law or
	in equity. Accordingly, our general partner will only be subject
	to the contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement
	and to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair
	dealing. We have adopted these modifications to allow our
	general partner and its affiliates to engage in transactions
	with us that might otherwise be prohibited by state-law
	fiduciary duty standards and to take into account the interests
	of other parties in addition to our interests and the interests
	of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest.
	Without these modifications, the general partners ability
	to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be
	restricted. These modifications are detrimental to the common
	unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to
	common unitholders for actions that without those limitations
	might constitute breaches of duty (including a fiduciary duty),
	as described below, and they permit our general





	263








	 






	 



	partner to take into account its own interests and the interests
	of third parties in addition to our interests and the interests
	of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest.


	 


	The following is a summary of the duties owed by our general
	partner to the limited partners under our partnership agreement
	as compared to the default fiduciary duty standards that
	otherwise would be owed by our general partner to the limited
	partners at law or in equity:


	 















	State Law Fiduciary Duty Standards





	Fiduciary duties are generally considered to include an
	obligation to act in good faith and with due care and loyalty.
	In the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement
	providing otherwise, the duty of care would generally require a
	general partner to inform itself prior to making a business
	decision of all material information reasonably available to it.
	In the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement
	providing otherwise, the duty of loyalty would generally
	prohibit a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership
	from taking any action or engaging in any transaction that is
	not fair to and in the best interests of the partnership where a
	conflict of interest is present.




	 





	Partnership Agreement Modified Standards






	General.  

	Our partnership agreement contains
	provisions that waive duties of or consent to conduct by our
	general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise
	issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law.
	For example, our partnership agreement provides that when our
	general partner, in its capacity as our general partner, is
	permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole
	discretion or pursuant to any provision of our
	partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of
	good faith then our general partner will not be
	subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider
	only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own
	interests, and will have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or
	otherwise) to give any consideration to any factors affecting us
	or any limited partners, including our common unitholders, and
	will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the
	partnership agreement or otherwise existing of law, in equity or
	otherwise. In addition, when our general partner is acting in
	its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our
	general partner, it may act without any fiduciary obligation to
	us or the common unitholders whatsoever. These standards reduce
	the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be
	held.




	 








	In addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the
	obligations of our general partner, our partnership agreement
	further provides that our general partner and its officers and
	directors will not be liable to us, our limited partners,
	including our common unitholders, or assignees for errors of
	judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a
	final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
	jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its








	264








	 






	 



















	officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or
	willful misconduct.




	 









	Special Provisions Regarding Affiliated
	Transactions.  

	Our partnership agreement generally
	provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of
	conflicts of interest not approved by a vote of holders of
	voting units (excluding voting units owned by the general
	partner and its affiliates) and that are not approved by the
	conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general
	partner will conclusively be deemed approved by the partnership
	and all partners, and will not constitute a breach of our
	partnership agreement or of any duty (including any fiduciary
	duty) existing at law, in equity or otherwise, unless our
	general Partner subjectively believes that the resolution or
	course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is
	opposed to the best interests of the partnership.




	 








	In any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited
	partner, including our common unitholders, or our partnership or
	any other person bound by our partnership agreement, the person
	bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of
	proving that the general Partner subjectively believed that such
	resolution or course of action was opposed to the best interests
	of the partnership. These standards reduce the obligations to
	which our general partner would otherwise be held.




	 





	Rights and Remedies of Common Unitholders Restricted by Modified
	Standards





	The Delaware Limited Partnership Act generally provides that a
	limited partner may institute legal action on behalf of the
	partnership to recover damages from a third-party where a
	general partner has refused to institute the action or where an
	effort to cause a general partner to do so is not likely to
	succeed. In addition, the statutory or case law of some
	jurisdictions may permit a limited partner to institute legal
	action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated
	limited partners to recover damages from a general partner for
	violations of its fiduciary duties to the limited partners.





	 



	By holding our common units, each common unitholder will
	automatically agree to be bound by the provisions in our
	partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed
	above

	. This is in accordance with the policy of the Delaware
	Limited Partnership Act favoring the principle of freedom of
	contract and the enforceability of partnership agreements. The
	failure of a common unitholder to sign our partnership agreement
	does not render our partnership agreement unenforceable against
	that person.


	 


	We have agreed to indemnify our general partner, any departing
	general partner, any person who is or was a tax matters partner,
	officer or director of our general partner or any departing
	general partner, any officer or directors of our general partner
	or any departing general partner who is or was serving at the
	request of our general partner as an officer, director,
	employee, member, partner, tax matters partner, agent, fiduciary
	or trustee of another person, any person who is named in the
	registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part as
	being or about to become a director of our general partner, or
	any person designated by our general partner, against any and
	all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several,
	expenses (including legal fees and expenses),





	265








	 






	 



	judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
	amounts incurred by our general partner or these other persons
	on an after tax basis. We have agreed to provide this
	indemnification unless there has been a final and

	non-appealable

	judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that
	these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful
	misconduct. We have also agreed to provide this indemnification
	for criminal proceedings. Thus, our general partner could be
	indemnified for its negligent acts if it met the requirements
	set forth above. To the extent these provisions purport to
	include indemnification for liabilities arising under the
	Securities Act, in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification
	is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable. See
	Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership

	DESCRIPTION
	OF COMMON UNITS





	 




	Common
	Units




	 


	Our common units represent limited partner interests in The
	Carlyle Group L.P. The holders of our common units are entitled
	to participate in our distributions and exercise the rights or
	privileges available to limited partners under our partnership
	agreement. For a description of the relative rights and
	preferences of holders of our common units in and to our
	distributions, see Cash Distribution Policy. For a
	description of the rights and privileges of limited partners
	under our partnership agreement, including voting rights, see
	Material Provisions of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership
	Agreement.


	 


	The execution of the partnership agreement of The Carlyle Group
	L.P. by our general partner is a condition to the issuance of
	common units in this offering.


	 


	Unless our general partner determines otherwise, we will issue
	all our common units in uncertificated form.


	 




	Transfer
	of Common Units




	 


	By acceptance of the transfer of our common units in accordance
	with our partnership agreement, each transferee of our common
	units will be admitted as a common unitholder with respect to
	the common units transferred when such transfer and admission is
	reflected in our books and records. Additionally, each
	transferee of our common units:


	 












	 


	 


	represents that the transferee has the capacity, power and
	authority to enter into our partnership agreement;




	 




	 


	 


	will become bound by the terms of, and will be deemed to have
	agreed to be bound by, our partnership agreement;




	 




	 


	 


	gives the consents, approvals, acknowledgements and waivers set
	forth in our partnership agreement, such as the approval of all
	transactions and agreements that we are entering into in
	connection with our formation and this offering.




	 


	A transferee will become a substituted limited partner of our
	partnership for the transferred common units automatically upon
	the recording of the transfer on our books and records. Our
	general partner will cause any transfers to be recorded on our
	books and records no less frequently than quarterly.


	 


	Common units are securities and are transferable according to
	the laws governing transfers of securities. In addition to other
	rights acquired upon transfer, the transferor gives the
	transferee the right to become a substituted limited partner in
	our partnership for the transferred common units.


	 


	Until a common unit has been transferred on our books, we and
	the transfer agent, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary,
	may treat the record holder of the common unit as the absolute
	owner for all purposes, except as otherwise required by law or
	stock exchange regulations. A beneficial holders rights
	are limited solely to those that it has against the record
	holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner
	and the record holder.


	 






	Transfer
	Agent and Registrar




	 


	American Stock Transfer & Trust Company will
	serve as registrar and transfer agent for our common units. You
	may contact the registrar and transfer agent at 6201
	15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

	MATERIAL
	PROVISIONS OF

	THE CARLYLE GROUP L.P. PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT





	 



	The following is a summary of the material provisions of the
	Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
	Partnership of The Carlyle Group L.P. as it will be in effect at
	the time of this offering, which is referred to in this
	prospectus as our partnership agreement, is included in this
	prospectus as Appendix A, and the following summary is
	qualified by reference thereto. For additional information, you
	should read the limited partnership agreement included in
	Appendix A to this prospectus, Description of Common
	Units  Transfer of Common Units and
	Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations.




	 




	General
	Partner





	 


	Our general partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., will
	manage all of our operations and activities. Our general partner
	is authorized in general to perform all acts that it determines
	to be necessary or appropriate to carry out our purposes and to
	conduct our business. Our partnership agreement will contain
	provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary
	duties) of our general partner and limit remedies available to
	common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a
	breach of duty. See Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary
	Responsibilities. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is
	wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle professionals. See
	Management  Composition of the Board of
	Directors after this Offering. Our common unitholders have
	only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and
	therefore have limited ability to influence managements
	decisions regarding our business. The voting rights of our
	common unitholders are limited as set forth in our partnership
	agreement and in the Delaware Limited Partnership Act. For
	example, our general partner may generally make amendments to
	our partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership
	without the approval of any common unitholder as set forth under
	 Amendment of the Partnership
	Agreement  No Limited Partner Approval.



	 




	Organization





	 


	We were formed on July 18, 2011 and will continue until
	cancellation of our certificate of limited partnership as
	provided in the Delaware Limited Partnership Act.



	 




	Purpose





	 


	Under our partnership agreement we will be permitted to engage,
	directly or indirectly, in any business activity that is
	approved by our general partner in its sole discretion and that
	lawfully may be conducted by a limited partnership organized
	pursuant to the Delaware Limited Partnership Act.



	 






	Power of
	Attorney





	 


	Each limited partner, and each person who acquires a limited
	partner interest in accordance with our partnership agreement,
	grants to our general partner and, if appointed, a liquidator, a
	power of attorney to, among other things, execute and file
	documents required for our qualification, continuance,
	dissolution or termination. The power of attorney will also
	grant our general partner the authority to amend, and to make
	consents and waivers under, our partnership agreement and
	certificate of limited partnership, in each case in accordance
	with our partnership agreement.



	 




	Capital
	Contributions





	 


	Our common unitholders will not be obligated to make additional
	capital contributions, except as described below under
	 Limited Liability. Our general partner
	is not obligated to make any capital contributions.




	268








	 






	 




	 




	Limited
	Liability





	 


	Assuming that a limited partner does not participate in the
	control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware
	Limited Partnership Act and that he, she or it otherwise acts in
	conformity with the provisions of our partnership agreement,
	his, her or its liability under the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act will be limited, subject to possible exceptions, to the
	amount of capital he, she or it is obligated to contribute to us
	for his, her or its common units, plus his, her or its share of
	any undistributed profits and assets, plus his, her or its
	obligation to make other payments that will be provided for in
	our partnership agreement. If it were determined however that
	the right, or exercise of the right, by the limited partners as
	a group:


	 












	 


	 


	to elect the directors of our general partner in limited
	circumstances,




	 




	 


	 


	to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement, or




	 




	 


	 


	to take other action under our partnership agreement,




	 


	constituted participation in the control of our
	business for the purposes of the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act, then our limited partners could be held personally liable
	for our obligations under the laws of Delaware to the same
	extent as our general partner. This liability would extend to
	persons who transact business with us who reasonably believe
	that the limited partner is a general partner. Neither our
	partnership agreement nor the Delaware Limited Partnership Act
	specifically provides for legal recourse against our general
	partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability
	through any fault of our general partner. While this does not
	mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse, we
	know of no precedent for this type of a claim in Delaware case
	law. The limitation on our general partners liability does
	not constitute a waiver of compliance with U.S. federal
	securities laws that would be void under Section 14 of the
	Securities Act.


	 


	Under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, a limited
	partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if, after
	the distribution, all liabilities of the limited partnership,
	other than liabilities to partners on account of their
	partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of
	creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership,
	would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited
	partnership. For the purpose of determining the fair value of
	the assets of a limited partnership, the Delaware Limited
	Partnership Act provides that the fair value of property subject
	to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited will be
	included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the
	extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the
	non-recourse liability. The Delaware Limited Partnership Act
	provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and
	knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was
	in violation of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act will be
	liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the
	distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
	Under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, a substituted
	limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the
	obligations of his assignor to make contributions to the
	partnership, except that such person is not obligated for
	liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a limited
	partner and that could not be ascertained from the partnership
	agreement.


	 


	Moreover, if it were determined that we were conducting business
	in any state without compliance with the applicable limited
	partnership statute, or that the right or exercise of the right
	by the limited partners as a group to elect the directors of our
	general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership
	agreement or to take other action under our partnership
	agreement constituted participation in the control
	of our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant
	jurisdiction, then the limited partners could be held personally
	liable for our obligations under the law of that jurisdiction to
	the same extent as our general partner under the circumstances.
	We intend to operate in a manner that our general partner
	considers reasonable and necessary or appropriate to preserve
	the limited liability of the limited partners.




	269








	 






	 




	 




	Issuance
	of Additional Securities





	 


	Our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited
	number of additional partnership securities and options, rights,
	warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership
	securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions
	established by our general partner in its sole discretion
	without the approval of any limited partners.


	 


	In accordance with the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the
	provisions of our partnership agreement, we may also issue
	additional partnership interests that have designations,
	preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from,
	and may be senior to, those applicable to the common units.



	 




	Distributions





	 


	Distributions will be made to the partners pro rata according to
	the percentages of their respective partnership interests. See
	Cash Distribution Policy.



	 




	Amendment
	of the Partnership Agreement





	 





	General





	 


	Amendments to our partnership agreement may be proposed only by
	our general partner. To adopt a proposed amendment, other than
	the amendments that require the approval of each limited partner
	affected or that do not require limited partner approval, each
	as discussed below, our general partner must seek approval of
	the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting units,
	unless a greater or lesser percentage is required under our
	partnership agreement, in order to approve the amendment or call
	a meeting of the limited partners to consider and vote upon the
	proposed amendment. See  Meetings; Voting.


	 





	Prohibited
	Amendments





	 


	No amendment may be made that would:


	 


	(1) enlarge the obligations of any limited partner without
	its consent, unless such enlargement may be deemed to have
	occurred as a result of any amendment that would have a material
	adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of
	partnership interests in relation to other classes of
	partnership interests that has been approved by the holders of
	not less than a majority of the outstanding partnership
	interests of the class affected; or


	 


	(2) enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any
	action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts
	distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable by us to our
	general partner or any of its affiliates without the consent of
	our general partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
	discretion.


	 





	No
	Limited Partner Approval





	 


	Our general partner may generally make amendments to our
	partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership
	without the approval of any limited partner to reflect:


	 


	(1) a change in the name of the partnership, the location
	of the partnerships principal place of business, the
	partnerships registered agent or its registered office;


	 


	(2) the admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of
	partners in accordance with our partnership agreement;


	 


	(3) a change that our general partner determines in its
	sole discretion is necessary or appropriate for the partnership
	to qualify or to continue our qualification as a limited
	partnership or a partnership in which the limited partners have
	limited liability under the laws of any state or other
	jurisdiction or to ensure that the partnership will not be
	treated as an





	270








	 






	 



	association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxed as an
	entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


	 


	(4) a change that our general partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate to address
	certain changes in U.S. federal, state or local income tax
	regulations, legislation or interpretation;


	 


	(5) an amendment that is necessary, in the opinion of our
	counsel, to prevent the partnership or our general partner or
	its directors, officers, employees, agents or trustees, from
	having a material risk of being in any manner subjected to
	registration under the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers
	Act or plan asset regulations adopted under ERISA,
	whether or not substantially similar to plan asset regulations
	currently applied or proposed by the U.S. Department of
	Labor;


	 


	(6) an amendment that our general partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate in connection
	with the creation, authorization or issuance of any class or
	series of partnership securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to partnership securities;


	 


	(7) any amendment expressly permitted in our partnership
	agreement to be made by our general partner acting alone;


	 


	(8) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by
	an agreement of merger, consolidation or other business
	combination agreement that has been approved under the terms of
	our partnership agreement;


	 


	(9) any amendment that in the sole discretion of our
	general partner is necessary or appropriate to reflect and
	account for the formation by the partnership of, or its
	investment in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
	limited liability company or other entity;


	 


	(10) a change in our fiscal year or taxable year and
	related changes;


	 


	(11) a merger with or conversion or conveyance to another
	limited liability entity that is newly formed and has no assets,
	liabilities or operations at the time of the merger, conversion
	or conveyance other than those it receives by way of the merger,
	conversion or conveyance or those arising out of its
	incorporation or formation;


	 


	(12) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by
	an amendment to any partnership agreement of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships that requires unitholders of any Carlyle
	Holdings partnership to provide a statement, certification or
	other proof of evidence to the Carlyle Holdings partnerships
	regarding whether such unitholder is subject to
	U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by the
	Carlyle Holdings partnerships;


	 


	(13) any amendment to the forum selection provisions of the
	partnership agreement that the general partner determines in
	good faith;


	 


	(14) any amendment that the general partner determines to
	be necessary or appropriate to cure any ambiguity, omission,
	mistake, defect or inconsistency; or


	 


	(15) any other amendments substantially similar to any of
	the matters described in (1) through (14) above.


	 


	In addition, our general partner may make amendments to our
	partnership agreement without the approval of any limited
	partner if those amendments, in the discretion of our general
	partner:


	 


	(1) do not adversely affect our limited partners considered
	as a whole (or adversely affect any particular class of
	partnership interests as compared to another class of
	partnership interests, except under clause (6) above) in
	any material respect; provided, however, for purposes of
	determining whether an amendment satisfies the requirements in
	this clause (1), our general partner may disregard any adverse
	effect on any class or classes of partnership





	271








	 






	 



	interests that have approved such amendment by the holders of
	not less than a majority of the outstanding partnership
	interests of the class so affected;


	 


	(2) are necessary or appropriate to satisfy any
	requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion,
	directive, order, ruling or regulation of any federal, state,
	local or

	non-U.S. agency

	or judicial authority or contained in any federal, state, local
	or

	non-U.S. statute

	(including the Delaware Limited Partnership Act);


	 


	(3) are necessary or appropriate to facilitate the trading
	of limited partner interests or to comply with any rule,
	regulation, guideline or requirement of any securities exchange
	on which the limited partner interests are or will be listed for
	trading;


	 


	(4) are necessary or appropriate for any action taken by
	our general partner relating to splits or combinations of units
	under the provisions of our partnership agreement; or


	 


	(5) are required to effect the intent expressed in the
	registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part or
	the intent of the provisions of our partnership agreement or are
	otherwise contemplated by our partnership agreement.


	 





	Opinion
	of Counsel and Limited Partner Approval





	 


	Our general partner will not be required to obtain an opinion of
	counsel that an amendment will not result in a loss of limited
	liability to the limited partners if one of the amendments
	described above under  No Limited Partner
	Approval should occur. No other amendments to our
	partnership agreement (other than an amendment pursuant to a
	merger, sale or other disposition of assets effected in
	accordance with the provisions described under
	 Merger, Sale or Other Disposition of
	Assets or an amendment described in the following
	paragraphs) will become effective without the approval of
	holders of at least 90% of the outstanding voting units, unless
	we obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that the amendment
	will not affect the limited liability of any of our limited
	partners under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act.


	 


	Except for amendments that may be adopted solely by our general
	partner or pursuant to a merger, any amendment that would have a
	material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any
	class of partnership interests in relation to other classes of
	partnership interests will also require the approval of the
	holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding
	partnership interests of the class so affected. Unless our
	general partner determines otherwise in its sole discretion,
	only our voting units will be treated as a separate class of
	partnership interest for this purpose.


	 


	In addition, any amendment that reduces the voting percentage
	required to take any action under our partnership agreement must
	be approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of
	limited partners whose aggregate outstanding voting units
	constitute not less than the voting or consent requirement
	sought to be reduced.



	 




	Merger,
	Sale or Other Disposition of Assets





	 


	Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner in
	its sole discretion may not, without the approval of the holders
	of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
	voting units, cause us to, among other things, sell or exchange
	all or substantially all of our assets in a single transaction
	or a series of related transactions, or approve the sale,
	exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
	assets of our subsidiaries; provided, however our general
	partner in its sole discretion may mortgage, pledge, hypothecate
	or grant a security interest in any or all of our assets
	(including for the benefit of persons other than us or our
	subsidiaries), including, in each case, pursuant to any forced
	sale of any or all of our assets pursuant to the foreclosure or
	other realization upon those encumbrances without the approval
	of the limited partners.


	 


	Our general partner may, with the approval of the holders of at
	least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting
	units, cause us to merge or consolidate or otherwise combine
	with





	272








	 






	 



	one or more other persons. In addition, if conditions specified
	in our partnership agreement are satisfied, our general partner
	may, without limited partner approval, convert or merge us into,
	or convey some or all of our assets to, a newly formed limited
	liability entity if (i) the sole purpose of that merger or
	conveyance is to effect a mere change in our legal form into
	another limited liability entity, (ii) our general partner
	receives an opinion of counsel that the merger or conveyance
	will not result in the loss of limited liability of any limited
	partner, and (iii) the governing instruments of the new
	entity provide the limited partners and our general partner with
	substantially the same rights and obligations as are contained
	in the partnership agreement. Additionally, our general partner
	may, without limited partner approval, cause our subsidiaries to
	merge or consolidate or otherwise combine with one or more other
	persons. The common unitholders will not be entitled to
	dissenters rights of appraisal under our partnership
	agreement or the Delaware Limited Partnership Act in the event
	of a merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our
	assets or any other similar transaction or event.



	 




	Election
	to be Treated as a Corporation





	 


	If our general partner, in its sole discretion, determines that
	it is no longer in our interests to continue as a partnership
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our general partner
	may elect to treat our partnership (or any of our subsidiaries)
	as an association or as a publicly traded partnership taxable as
	a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state)
	income tax purposes or may effect such change by merger or
	conversion or otherwise under applicable law.



	 




	Dissolution





	 


	We will dissolve upon:


	 


	(1) the election of our general partner to dissolve our
	partnership, if approved by the holders of a majority of the
	voting power of the partnerships outstanding voting units;


	 


	(2) there being no limited partners, unless our partnership
	is continued without dissolution in accordance with the Delaware
	Limited Partnership Act;


	 


	(3) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of our
	partnership pursuant to the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act; or


	 


	(4) the withdrawal of our general partner or any other
	event that results in its ceasing to be our general partner
	other than by reason of a transfer by our general partner of all
	of its general partner interests pursuant to our partnership
	agreement unless a successor general partner is appointed in
	accordance with our partnership agreement.


	 


	Upon a dissolution under clause (4), the holders of a majority
	of the voting power of our outstanding voting units may also
	elect, within specific time limitations, to continue the
	partnerships business without dissolution on the same
	terms and conditions described in the partnership agreement by
	appointing as a successor general partner an individual or
	entity approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power
	of the outstanding voting units, subject to the
	partnerships receipt of an opinion of counsel to the
	effect that: (1) the action would not result in the loss of
	limited liability of any limited partner; and (2) neither
	we nor any of our subsidiaries (excluding those formed or
	existing as corporations) would be treated as an association
	taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of
	that right to continue.



	 




	Liquidation
	and Distribution of Proceeds





	 


	Upon our dissolution, our general partner shall act, or select
	in its sole discretion one or more persons to act, as
	liquidator. Unless we are continued as a limited partnership,
	the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs will, acting
	with all of the powers of our general partner that the
	liquidator deems necessary or appropriate in its judgment,
	liquidate our assets and apply the proceeds of the liquidation
	first, to discharge our liabilities as provided in our
	partnership

	agreement and by law, and thereafter, to the partners according
	to the percentages of their respective partnership interests as
	of a record date selected by the liquidator. The liquidator may
	defer liquidation or distribution of our assets for a reasonable
	period of time or distribute assets to partners in kind if it
	determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some
	of our assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to
	the partners.



	 




	Withdrawal
	or Removal of the General Partner





	 


	Except as described below, our general partner will agree not to
	withdraw voluntarily as the general partner on or prior to
	December 31, 2021 without obtaining the approval of the
	holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the
	outstanding voting units, excluding voting units held by our
	general partner and its affiliates, and furnishing an opinion of
	counsel regarding tax and limited liability matters. After
	December 31, 2021, our general partner may withdraw as
	general partner without first obtaining approval of any common
	unitholder by giving 90 days advance notice, and that
	withdrawal will not constitute a violation of our partnership
	agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our general partner
	may withdraw at any time without common unitholder approval upon
	90 days advance notice to the limited partners if at
	least 50% of the outstanding common units are beneficially
	owned, owned of record or otherwise controlled by one person and
	its affiliates other than our general partner and its affiliates.


	 


	Upon the withdrawal of our general partner under any
	circumstances, the holders of a majority of the voting power of
	the partnerships outstanding voting units may elect a
	successor to that withdrawing general partner. If a successor is
	not elected, or is elected but an opinion of counsel regarding
	limited liability and tax matters cannot be obtained, the
	partnership will be dissolved, wound up and liquidated, unless
	within specific time limitations after that withdrawal, the
	holders of a majority of the voting power of the
	partnerships outstanding voting units agree in writing to
	continue our business and to appoint a successor general
	partner. See  Dissolution above.


	 


	Our common unitholders will have no right to remove or expel,
	with or without cause, our general partner.


	 


	In circumstances where a general partner withdraws and a
	successor general partner is elected in accordance with our
	partnership agreement, the departing general partner will have
	the option to require the successor general partner to purchase
	the general partner interest of the departing general partner
	for a cash payment equal to its fair value. This fair value will
	be determined by agreement between the departing general partner
	and the successor general partner. If no agreement is reached
	within 30 days of the effective date of the general
	partners departure, an independent investment banking firm
	or other independent expert, which, in turn, may rely on other
	experts, selected by the departing general partner and the
	successor general partner will determine the fair value. If the
	departing general partner and the successor general partner
	cannot agree upon an expert within 45 days of the effective
	date of the general partners departure, then an expert
	chosen by agreement of the independent investment banking firms
	or independent experts selected by each of them will determine
	the fair value.


	 


	If the option described above is not exercised by the departing
	general partner, the departing general partners general
	partner interest will automatically convert into common units
	pursuant to a valuation of those interests as determined by an
	investment banking firm or other independent expert selected in
	the manner described in the preceding paragraph.


	 


	In addition, we will be required to reimburse the departing
	general partner for all amounts due the departing general
	partner, including without limitation all employee-related
	liabilities, including severance liabilities, incurred for the
	termination of any employees employed by the departing general
	partner or its affiliates for the partnerships benefit.




	274








	 






	 




	 




	Transfer
	of General Partner Interests





	 


	Except for transfer by our general partner of all, but not less
	than all, of its general partner interests in the partnership to
	an affiliate of our general partner, or to another entity as
	part of the merger or consolidation of our general partner with
	or into another entity or the transfer by our general partner of
	all but not less than all, of its assets to another entity, our
	general partner may not transfer all or any part of its general
	partner interest in the partnership to another person prior to
	December 31, 2021 without the approval of the holders of at
	least a majority of the voting power of the partnerships
	outstanding voting units, excluding voting units held by our
	general partner and its affiliates. On or after
	December 31, 2021, our general partner may transfer all or
	any part of its general partner interest without first obtaining
	approval of any common unitholder. As a condition of this
	transfer, the transferee must assume the rights and duties of
	the general partner under our partnership agreement and agree to
	be bound by the provisions of our partnership agreement and
	furnish to us an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability
	matters. At any time, the members of our general partner may
	sell or transfer all or part of their limited liability company
	interests in our general partner without the approval of the
	common unitholders.



	 




	Limited
	Call Right





	 


	If at any time:


	 


	(i) less than 10% of the total limited partner interests of
	any class then outstanding (other than special voting units),
	including our common units, are held by persons other than our
	general partner and its affiliates; or


	 


	(ii) the partnership is subjected to registration under the
	provisions of the 1940 Act,


	 


	our general partner will have the right, which it may assign in
	whole or in part to any of its affiliates or to us, exercisable
	in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not less than all,
	of the remaining limited partner interests of the class held by
	unaffiliated persons as of a record date to be selected by our
	general partner, on at least ten but not more than 60 days
	notice. The purchase price in the event of this purchase is the
	greater of:


	 


	(1) the current market price as of the date three days
	before the date the notice is mailed, and


	 


	(2) the highest cash price paid by our general partner or
	any of its affiliates acting in concert with us for any limited
	partner interests of the class purchased within the 90 days
	preceding the date on which our general partner first mails
	notice of its election to purchase those limited partner
	interests.


	 


	As a result of our general partners right to purchase
	outstanding limited partner interests, a holder of limited
	partner interests may have his limited partner interests
	purchased at an undesirable time or price. The U.S. tax
	consequences to a common unitholder of the exercise of this call
	right are the same as a sale by that common unitholder of his
	common units in the market. See Material U.S. Federal
	Tax Considerations  United States Taxes 
	Consequences to U.S. Holders of Common Units.



	 




	Meetings;
	Voting





	 


	Except as described below regarding a person or group owning 20%
	or more of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then outstanding,
	record holders of common units (other than any person whom our
	general partner may from time to time with such persons
	consent designate as a

	non-voting

	common unitholder) or of special voting units will be entitled
	to notice of, and to vote at, meetings of our limited partners
	and to act upon matters as to which holders of limited partner
	interests have the right to vote or to act.




	275








	 






	 



	Except as described below regarding a person or group owning 20%
	or more of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then outstanding,
	each record holder of a common unit of The Carlyle Group L.P.
	(other than any person whom our general partner may from time to
	time with such persons consent designate as a non-voting
	common unitholder) is entitled to a number of votes equal to the
	number of common units held of record as of the relevant record
	date.


	 


	In addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity
	wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, will hold a
	special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes on
	any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common
	unitholders that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and
	unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by any limited
	partner of Carlyle Holdings that does not itself hold a special
	voting unit. A special voting unit held by any holder other than
	TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C. will provide that holder with
	a number of votes on any matter that may be submitted for a vote
	of our common unitholders that is equal to the number of vested
	and unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by such
	holder. We do not expect any holder other than TCG Carlyle
	Global Partners L.L.C. to hold a special voting unit upon
	consummation of this offering. We refer to our common units
	(other than those held by any person whom our general partner
	may from time to time with such persons consent designate
	as a

	non-voting

	common unitholder) and our special voting units as voting
	units. Our voting units will be treated as a single class
	on all such matters submitted for a vote of our common
	unitholders. If the ratio at which Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units are exchangeable for our common units changes from

	one-for-one

	as described under Certain Relationships and Related
	Person Transactions  Exchange Agreement, the
	number of votes to which the holders of the special voting units
	are entitled will be adjusted accordingly. Additional limited
	partner interests having special voting rights could also be
	issued. See  Issuance of Additional
	Securities above.


	 


	In the case of common units held by our general partner on
	behalf of non-citizen assignees, our general partner will
	distribute the votes on those common units in the same ratios as
	the votes of partners in respect of other limited partner
	interests are cast.


	 


	Our general partner does not anticipate that any meeting of
	common unitholders will be called in the foreseeable future. Any
	action that is required or permitted to be taken by the limited
	partners may be taken either at a meeting of the limited
	partners or without a meeting, without a vote and without prior
	notice if consented to in writing or by electronic transmission
	by limited partners owning not less than the minimum percentage
	of the voting power of the outstanding limited partner interests
	that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a
	meeting at which all the limited partners were present and
	voted. Meetings of the limited partners may be called by our
	general partner or by limited partners owning at least 50% or
	more of the voting power of the outstanding limited partner
	interests of the class or classes for which a meeting is
	proposed. Common unitholders may vote either in person or by
	proxy at meetings. The holders of a majority of the voting power
	of the outstanding limited partner interests of the class or
	classes for which a meeting has been called, represented in
	person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum unless any action
	by the limited partners requires approval by holders of a
	greater percentage of such limited partner interests, in which
	case the quorum will be the greater percentage.


	 


	However, if at any time any person or group (other than our
	general partner and its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently
	approved transferee of our general partner or its affiliates)
	acquires, in the aggregate, beneficial ownership of 20% or more
	of any class of The Carlyle Group L.P. common units then
	outstanding, that person or group will lose voting rights on all
	of its common units and the common units owned by such person or
	group may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered
	to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of limited
	partners, calculating required votes, determining the presence
	of a quorum or for other similar purposes.

	Election
	of Directors of General Partner





	 


	On January 31 of each year (each a Determination
	Date), our general partner will determine whether the
	total voting power held by (i) holders of the special
	voting units in The Carlyle Group L.P. (including voting units
	held by our general partner and its affiliates) in their
	capacity as such, (ii) then-current or former Carlyle
	personnel (treating voting units deliverable to such persons
	pursuant to outstanding equity awards as being held by them), or
	(iii) any estate, trust, partnership or limited liability
	company or other similar entity of which any such person is a
	trustee, partner, member or similar party, respectively,
	constitutes at least 10% of the voting power of the outstanding
	voting units of The Carlyle Group L.P., which we refer to as the
	Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition.


	 


	The method of nomination, election and removal of the members of
	the board of directors of our general partner shall be
	determined accordingly as follows: (i) in any year in which
	our general partner has determined on the applicable
	Determination Date that the Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition
	has not been satisfied, the directors shall be elected at an
	annual meeting of our common unitholders; and (ii) in any
	year in which our general partner has determined on the
	applicable Determination Date that the Carlyle Partners
	Ownership Condition has been satisfied, the board of directors
	of our general partner will be appointed and removed by its
	members in accordance with the limited liability company
	agreement of our general partner and not by our limited
	partners. See Management  Composition of the
	Board of Directors after this Offering.


	 


	We will hold an annual meeting of our common unitholders for the
	election of directors in any year in which we do not satisfy the
	Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition on the applicable
	Determination Date. At any such annual meeting, the holders of
	outstanding voting units shall vote together as a single class
	for the election of directors to the board of directors of our
	general partner. Our limited partners shall elect by a plurality
	of the votes cast at such meeting persons to serve as directors
	who are nominated in accordance with our partnership agreement.
	If our general partner has provided at least thirty days advance
	notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected, then
	the limited partners holding outstanding voting units that
	attend such meeting shall constitute a quorum, and if the our
	general partner has provided less than thirty days advance
	notice of any such meeting, then limited partners holding a
	majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting units
	shall constitute a quorum.


	 


	Prior to any annual meeting of our common unitholders for the
	election of directors held in the next succeeding year following
	a year in which an annual meeting of our common unitholders for
	the election of directors was not held (each such annual meeting
	an Initial Annual Meeting), the board of directors
	of our general partner shall be divided into three classes,
	Class I, Class II, and Class III, as determined
	by the then-existing board of directors in its sole discretion.
	Each Director shall serve for a three-year term; provided,
	however, that the directors designated to Class I shall
	serve for an initial term that expires on the applicable Initial
	Annual Meeting, the directors designated to Class II shall
	serve for an initial term that expires on the first annual
	meeting following the applicable Initial Annual Meeting, and the
	directors designated to Class III shall serve for an
	initial term that expires on the second annual meeting following
	the applicable Initial Annual Meeting. At each succeeding annual
	meeting of limited partners for the election of Directors
	following an Initial Annual Meeting, successors to the directors
	whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a
	three-year term. If in any year following an Initial Annual
	Meeting, our general partner determines on the applicable
	Determination Date that the Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition
	has been satisfied, the board of directors of our general
	partner will be appointed and removed by its members in
	accordance with the limited liability company agreement of our
	general partner and not by our limited partners.




	277








	 






	 




	 




	Non-Voting
	Common Unitholders





	 


	Any person whom our general partner may from time to time with
	such persons consent designate as a non-voting common
	unitholder, will have no voting rights whatsoever with respect
	to their common units, including any voting rights that may
	otherwise exist under our partnership agreement, under the
	Delaware Limited Partnership Act, at law, in equity or
	otherwise, provided that any amendment to the partnership
	agreement that would have a material adverse effect on the
	rights or preferences of our common units beneficially owned by
	non-voting common unitholders in relation to other common units
	must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of
	the common units beneficially owned by the non-voting common
	unitholders. However, unaffiliated third party transferees of
	common units from a non-voting common unitholder will have the
	same voting rights with respect to such common units as other
	holders of common units.



	 




	Status as
	Limited Partner





	 


	By transfer of common units in accordance with our partnership
	agreement, each transferee of common units will be admitted as a
	limited partner with respect to the common units transferred
	when such transfer and admission is reflected in our books and
	records. The common units will be fully paid and non-assessable
	except as such non-assessability may be affected by

	section 17-607

	as described under  Limited Liability
	above, pursuant to

	Section 17-804

	of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act (which relates to the
	liability of a limited partner who receives a distribution of
	assets during the winding up of a limited partnership and who
	knew at the time of such distribution that it was in violation
	of this provision) or as set forth in the partnership agreement.



	 




	Non-Citizen
	Assignees; Redemption





	 


	If the partnership or any subsidiary is or becomes subject to
	federal, state or local laws or regulations that in the
	determination of our general partner in its sole discretion
	create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any
	property in which the partnership or any subsidiary has an
	interest because of the nationality, citizenship or other
	related status of any limited partner, we may redeem the common
	units held by that limited partner at their current market
	price. To avoid any cancellation or forfeiture, our general
	partner may require each limited partner to furnish information
	about his, her or its nationality, citizenship or related
	status. If a limited partner fails to furnish information about
	his nationality, citizenship or other related status within
	30 days after receipt of a request for the information or
	our general partner determines, with the advice of counsel,
	after receipt of the information that the limited partner is not
	an eligible citizen, the limited partner may be treated as a
	non-citizen assignee. A non-citizen assignee does not have the
	right to direct the voting of his, her or its common units and
	may not receive distributions in kind upon our liquidation but
	will be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof.



	 






	Indemnification





	 


	Under our partnership agreement, in most circumstances we will
	indemnify the following persons, to the fullest extent permitted
	by law, from and against all losses, claims, damages,
	liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees
	and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
	settlements or other amounts on an after tax basis:


	 












	 


	 


	our general partner;




	 




	 


	 


	any departing general partner;




	 




	 


	 


	any person who is or was a tax matters partner, officer or
	director of our general partner or any departing general partner;




	 




	 


	 


	any officer or director of our general partner or any departing
	general partner who is or was serving at the request of our
	general partner or any departing general partner as an officer,







	278








	 






	 













	 




	director, employee, member, partner, tax matters partner, agent,
	fiduciary or trustee of another person;




	 












	 


	 


	any person who controls a general partner or departing general
	partner;




	 




	 


	 


	any person who is named in the registration statement of which
	this prospectus forms a part as being or about to become a
	director of our general partner; or




	 




	 


	 


	any person designated by our general partner in its sole
	discretion.




	 


	We would agree to provide this indemnification unless there has
	been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of
	competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in
	bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We will
	also agree to provide this indemnification for criminal
	proceedings. Any indemnification under these provisions will
	only be out of the partnerships assets. The general
	partner will not be personally liable for, or have any
	obligation to contribute or loan funds or assets to the
	partnership to enable the partnership to effectuate
	indemnification. The indemnification of the persons described
	above in the fourth bullet point shall be secondary to any
	indemnification such person is entitled from another person or
	the relevant Carlyle fund to the extent applicable. Our
	partnership agreement will provide that each of our limited
	partners and any other person who acquires an equity interest in
	the partnership will waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
	law, any and all rights to seek punitive and certain other
	damages. We may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted
	against and expenses incurred by persons for our activities,
	regardless of whether the partnership would have the power to
	indemnify the person against liabilities under our partnership
	agreement.



	 




	Forum
	Selection





	 




	Our partnership agreement will provide that the partnership, the
	general partner, each of the limited partners, each person in
	whose name any interest in the partnership is registered, each
	other person who acquires an interest in any equity interest in
	the partnership and each other person who is bound by the
	partnership agreement (collectively, the Consenting
	Parties and each a Consenting Party)
	(1) irrevocably agrees that, unless the general partner
	shall otherwise agree in writing, any claims, suits, actions or
	proceedings arising out of or relating in any way to the
	partnership agreement or any interest in the partnership
	(including, without limitation, any claims, suits or actions

	each case, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
	thereunder (regardless of whether such Disputes (x) sound
	in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, (y) are based on
	common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds, or
	(z) are derivative or direct claims))

	does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other

	director, agent or indemnitee) for alleged actions or omissions
	of such employee, officer, director, agent or indemnitee
	undertaken as an employee, officer, director, agent or
	indemnitee of such Consenting Party or its affiliates, such
	employee, officer, director, agent or indemnitee shall be
	entitled to invoke the forum selection provisions of the
	partnership agreement.



	 




	Books and
	Reports





	 


	Our general partner is required to keep appropriate books of the
	partnerships business at our principal offices or any
	other place designated by our general partner. The books will be
	maintained for both tax and financial reporting purposes on an
	accrual basis. For tax and financial reporting purposes, our
	year ends on December 31.


	 


	As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each fiscal
	year, we will furnish to each partner tax information (including
	a

	Schedule K-1),

	which describes on a U.S. dollar basis such partners
	share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for our preceding
	taxable year. Although we currently intend to distribute

	Schedule K-1s

	on or around 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, it
	may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal
	year to obtain the requisite information from all lower-tier
	entities so that

	Schedule K-1s

	may be prepared for our partnership. Consequently, holders of
	common units who are U.S. taxpayers should anticipate that
	they may need to file annually with the IRS (and certain states)
	a request for an extension past April 15 or the otherwise
	applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable
	year. In addition, each partner will be required to report for
	all tax purposes consistently with the information provided by
	us. See Material U.S. Federal Tax
	Considerations  Administrative Matters 
	Information Returns.



	 




	Right to
	Inspect Our Books and Records





	 


	Our partnership agreement will provide that a limited partner
	can, for a purpose reasonably related to his interest as a
	limited partner, upon reasonable written demand stating the
	purpose for such demand and at his own expense, have furnished
	to him:


	 












	 


	 


	promptly after becoming available, a copy of our
	U.S. federal income tax returns (excluding for the
	avoidance of doubt, information that is specific to another
	partner);




	 




	 


	 


	a current list of the name and last known business, residence or
	mailing address of each record holder; and




	 




	 


	 


	copies of our partnership agreement, the certificate of limited
	partnership of the partnership, related amendments and powers of
	attorney under which they have been executed.




	 


	Our general partner may, and intends to, keep confidential from
	the limited partners trade secrets or other information the
	disclosure of which our general partner believes is not in our
	partnerships best interests, could damage our partnership
	or its business or which the partnership is required by law or
	by agreements with third parties to keep confidential. In
	addition, our partnership agreement will provide for certain
	restrictions on the rights of a limited partner to receive
	information from us for the purpose of determining whether to
	pursue litigation or assist in pending litigation against us.

	COMMON
	UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE





	 


	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our
	common units. We cannot predict the effect, if any, future sales
	of common units, or the availability for future sale of common
	units, will have on the market price of our common units
	prevailing from time to time. The sale of substantial amounts of
	our common units in the public market, or the perception that
	such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price
	of our common units.


	 


	Upon completion of this offering we will have a total of
	30,500,000 of our common units outstanding (or 35,075,000 common
	units if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
	purchase additional common units). All of the common units will
	have been sold in this offering and will be freely tradable
	without restriction or further registration under the Securities
	Act by persons other than our affiliates. Under the
	Securities Act, an affiliate of an issuer is a
	person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or
	is under common control with that issuer.


	 


	In addition, subject to certain limitations and exceptions,
	pursuant to the terms of an exchange agreement we have entered
	into with our existing owners, limited partners of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships may, subject to the vesting and minimum
	retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set
	forth in the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships, from time to time and up to four times each year,
	from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing
	of this offering (subject to the terms of the exchange
	agreement), exchange partnership units in Carlyle Holdings for
	our common units on a

	one-for-one

	basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for
	splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In addition,
	subject to certain requirements, CalPERS will generally be
	permitted to exchange Carlyle Holdings partnership units for
	common units from and after the closing of this offering and
	Mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships units for common units following the first
	anniversary of the closing of this offering. Any common units
	received by Mubadala and CalPERS in any such exchange during the
	applicable restricted periods described in
	 Lock-Up Arrangements  Mubadala
	Transfer Restrictions and Common Units Eligible for
	Future Sale  Lock-Up Arrangements  CalPERS
	Transfer Restrictions, respectively, would be subject to
	the restrictions described in such sections. A Carlyle Holdings
	limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of
	the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange
	for a common unit. Upon consummation of this offering, our
	existing owners will beneficially own 274,000,000 Carlyle
	Holdings partnership units, all of which will be exchangeable
	for our common units. The common units we issue upon such
	exchanges would be restricted securities as defined
	in Rule 144 unless we register such issuances. However, we
	will enter into one or more registration rights agreements with
	our existing owners that will require us to register under the
	Securities Act these common units. See
	 Registration Rights and Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
	Registration Rights Agreements.


	 


	Under the terms of the partnership agreements of the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships, the Carlyle Holdings partnership units
	received by our existing owners that we employ (or The Carlyle
	Group L.P. common units that may be received in exchange for
	such Carlyle Holdings partnership units) will be subject to
	vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer
	restrictions. The partnership units received by CalPERS and
	Mubadala (or The Carlyle Group L.P. common units that may be
	received in exchange for such Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units) will be subject to certain transfer restrictions. See
	Management  Vesting; Minimum Retained Ownership
	Requirements and Transfer Restrictions and Certain
	Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
	Carlyle Holdings Partnership Agreements.


	 


	Further, at the time of this offering, we have granted to our
	employees who are not senior Carlyle professionals deferred
	restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the
	initial public offering price per common unit in this offering
	of $375.3 million (17,056,935 deferred restricted common
	units) and phantom deferred restricted common units with an
	aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per
	common unit in this offering of $8.0 million (362,875
	phantom deferred restricted common units). Additional common
	units and Carlyle Holdings





	281








	 






	 



	partnership units will be available for future grant under our
	Equity Incentive Plan, which plan provides for automatic annual
	increases in the number of units available for future issuance.
	See Management  Equity Incentive Plan and
	 IPO Date Equity Awards. We have filed a
	registration statement and intend to file additional
	registration statements on

	Form S-8

	under the Securities Act to register common units or securities
	convertible into or exchangeable for common units issued or
	available for future grant under our Equity Incentive Plan
	(including pursuant to automatic annual increases). Any such

	Form S-8

	registration statement will automatically become effective upon
	filing. Accordingly, common units registered under such
	registration statement will be available for sale in the open
	market. The initial registration statement on

	Form S-8

	covered 30,450,000 common units.


	 


	Our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited
	number of additional partnership securities and options, rights,
	warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership
	securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions
	established by our general partner in its sole discretion
	without the approval of any limited partners. In accordance with
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the provisions of our
	partnership agreement, we may also issue additional partnership
	interests that have certain designations, preferences, rights,
	powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to,
	those applicable to common units. See Material Provisions
	of The Carlyle Group L.P. Partnership Agreement 
	Issuance of Additional Securities. Similarly, the Carlyle
	Holdings partnership agreements authorize the wholly-owned
	subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P. which are the general
	partners of those partnerships to issue an unlimited number of
	additional partnership securities of the Carlyle Holdings
	partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers
	and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those
	applicable to the Carlyle Holdings partnerships units, and which
	may be exchangeable for our common units.


	 




	Registration
	Rights




	 


	We will enter into a registration rights agreement with our
	existing owners other than CalPERS and Mubadala (the
	Senior Carlyle Professional Registration Rights
	Agreement). The following description of the Senior
	Carlyle Professional Registration Rights Agreement is not
	complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the
	form of Senior Carlyle Professional Registration Rights
	Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration
	statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Pursuant to the
	Senior Carlyle Professional Registration Rights Agreement, we
	will agree to register the exchange of Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units for common units by our existing owners. In
	addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity
	wholly-owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, has the right
	to request that we register the sale of common units held by our
	existing owners an unlimited number of times and may require us
	to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales
	of common units into the market from time to time over an
	extended period. In addition, TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C.
	will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration
	rights in respect of common units held by our existing owners in
	connection with registered offerings requested by other
	registration rights holders or initiated by us. Securities
	registered under any such registration statement will be
	available for sale in the open market unless restrictions apply.
	See Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Registration Rights Agreements.


	 


	In addition, in accordance with the terms of their respective
	subscription agreements, we will enter into separate
	registration rights agreements with CalPERS (the CalPERS
	Registration Rights Agreement) and Mubadala (the
	Mubadala Registration Rights Agreement). The
	following description of the CalPERS Registration Rights
	Agreement and the Mubadala Registration Rights Agreement is not
	complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the
	forms of such agreements, which will be filed as exhibits to the
	registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
	Pursuant to these agreements, we will grant CalPERS and Mubadala
	and their respective affiliates the right, under certain
	circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us
	to register under the Securities Act common units delivered in
	exchange for Carlyle Holdings partnership units or common units
	(and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or
	exercisable for our common units) otherwise held by them. Under
	the CalPERS Registration

	Rights Agreement, at any time following the 180th day after the
	completion of this offering, CalPERS will have the right to
	request that we register the sale of common units held by them
	under the Securities Act on

	Form S-1

	in minimum amounts of $25 million, or on

	Form S-3,

	in minimum amounts of $10.0 million, provided, however,
	that we will not be obligated to effect any such requested
	registration within 180 days after the effective date of a
	previous registration pursuant to the CalPERS Registration
	Rights Agreement. Under the Mubadala Registration Rights
	Agreement, upon the expiration of the applicable

	lock-up

	period, as described below under

	 Lock-Up

	Arrangements  Mubadala Transfer Restrictions,
	Mubadala will have the right to request not more than six times
	that we register the sale of common units held by them in
	minimum amounts of $25 million, provided, however, that we
	will not be obligated to effect any such requested registration
	within 180 days after the effective date of a previous
	registration pursuant to the Mubadala Registration Rights
	Agreement. In addition, CalPERS and Mubadala will have the
	ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in
	respect of common units held by them in connection with
	registered offerings requested by other registration rights
	holders or initiated by us.

	Form S-8

	to register common units or securities convertible into or

	The representatives in their sole discretion may release any of
	the securities subject to these

	lock-up

	agreements at any time without notice. The representatives do
	not have any current intention to release common units or other
	securities subject to the

	lock-up

	agreements. If the representatives, in their sole discretion,
	agree to release or waive the restrictions set forth in a

	lock-up

	agreement for an officer or director of our general partner and
	provide us with notice of the impending release or waiver at
	least three business days before the effective date of the
	release or waiver, we have agreed to announce the impending
	release or waiver by a press release through a major news
	service at least two business days before the effective date of
	the release or waiver. In addition, the partnership agreements
	of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and related agreements will
	contractually restrict our existing owners ability to
	transfer the Carlyle Holdings partnership units or the common
	units they hold. We have agreed that we will not waive, modify
	or amend such transfer restrictions during the period ending
	180 days after the date of this prospectus. We also have
	instituted an internal policy that prohibits our employees from
	selling short or trading in derivative securities relating to
	the common units.


	 





	Carlyle
	Transfer Restrictions





	 


	As described in Management  Vesting; Minimum
	Retained Ownership Requirements and Transfer Restrictions,
	holders of our Carlyle Holdings partnership units (other than
	Mubadala and CalPERS), including our founders and other senior
	Carlyle professionals, will be prohibited from transferring or
	exchanging any such units until the fifth anniversary of this
	offering without our consent.


	 





	Mubadala
	Transfer Restrictions





	 


	The equity interests in Carlyle held by Mubadala (whether held
	in the form of common units, partnership units or otherwise are
	subject to the transfer restrictions described in the Mubadala
	Subscription Agreement. The transfer restrictions that will be
	applicable upon consummation of this offering are outlined
	below, although we may waive such restrictions in whole or in
	part from time to time.


	 


	None of the equity interests in our business held by Mubadala
	after the closing of this offering and the consummation of the
	offering transactions, as described above under
	Organizational Structure  Offering
	Transactions will be transferable prior to the twelve
	month anniversary of the closing of this offering.


	 


	Following the twelve month anniversary of the closing of this
	offering, Mubadala may transfer its equity interests in our
	business to the extent necessary to reduce its aggregate
	beneficial ownership of our business below 10% in order to
	comply with, or eliminate the obligation to comply with, any
	applicable regulatory, stock or exchange or other government
	regulations or requirements (other than those pursuant to
	Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act or Rule 144
	under the Securities Act) if non-compliance with such
	regulations or requirements would materially and adversely
	impact Mubadala.


	 


	In addition, 100% of the 18,566,902 Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by Mubadala in respect of Mubadalas initial
	investment in our business in October 2007 will be free from
	transfer restrictions following the

	12-month

	anniversary of the closing of this offering. With respect to the
	4,951,037 Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by Mubadala in
	respect of Mubadalas investment in December 2010, 50% of
	such partnership units will be free from transfer restrictions
	following the

	18-month

	anniversary of the closing of this offering, and 100% of such
	partnership units will be free from transfer restrictions
	following the

	24-month

	anniversary of the closing of this offering.

	Transfer Restrictions





	 


	CalPERS has also agreed to be bound by the restrictions
	described above under

	 Lock-Up

	Arrangements. However, the Carlyle Holdings partnership
	units held by CalPERS are not otherwise subject to transfer
	restrictions. After the consummation of this offering, CalPERS
	will own an aggregate of 12,721,452 Carlyle Holdings
	partnership units.


	 




	Rule 144




	 


	In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, a person who
	is not deemed to be our affiliate for purposes of the Securities
	Act or to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the
	three months preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the
	common units proposed to be sold for at least six months,
	including the holding period of any prior owner other than our
	affiliates, is entitled to sell those common units without
	complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice
	provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public
	information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has
	beneficially owned the common units proposed to be sold for at
	least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner
	other than our affiliates, then that person is entitled to sell
	those common units without complying with any of the
	requirements of Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144, as
	currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling common
	units on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell, within
	any three-month period, a number of common units that does not
	exceed the greater of (1) 1% of the number of common units then
	outstanding and (2) the average weekly training volume of the
	common units during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing
	of a notice on Form 144 with respect to that sale. Sales
	under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling common
	units on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain
	manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the
	availability of current public information about us.

	MATERIAL
	U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS





	 


	This summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax
	considerations related to the purchase, ownership and
	disposition of our common units as of the date hereof. For
	purposes of this discussion, references to Carlyle,
	we, our, and us mean only
	The Carlyle Group L.P. and not its subsidiaries, except as
	otherwise indicated. This summary is based on provisions of the
	Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, on the regulations
	promulgated thereunder and on published administrative rulings
	and pronouncements of the IRS and judicial decisions, all of
	which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
	time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is
	necessarily general and may not apply to all categories of
	investors, some of which, such as banks, or other financial
	institutions, real estate investment trusts, investors who are
	deemed to own 10% or more of our common units, persons holding
	common units as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion
	transaction or straddle, traders in securities that elect to use
	a

	mark-to-market

	method of accounting for their securities holdings, charitable
	remainder unit trusts, common trust funds, insurance companies,
	persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, dealers and
	other investors that do not own their common units as capital
	assets, may be subject to special rules. Tax-exempt
	organizations and mutual funds are discussed separately below.
	In addition, except to the extent provided below, this
	discussion does not address any aspect of state, local or

	non-U.S. tax

	law. The actual tax consequences of the purchase and ownership
	of common units will vary depending on your circumstances. This
	discussion, to the extent that it states matters of
	U.S. federal tax law or legal conclusions and subject to
	the qualifications herein, represents the opinion of Simpson
	Thacher & Bartlett LLP. Such opinion is based in part
	on facts described in this prospectus and on various other
	factual assumptions, representations and determinations. Any
	alteration or incorrectness of such facts, assumptions,
	representations or determinations could adversely affect such
	opinion. However, opinions of counsel are not binding upon the
	IRS or any court, and the IRS may challenge the conclusions
	herein and a court may sustain such a challenge.


	 


	For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder
	is a beneficial holder of a common unit that is for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes (1) an individual
	citizen or resident of the United States; (2) a corporation
	(or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws
	of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
	Columbia; (3) an estate the income of which is subject to
	U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or
	(4) a trust which either (A) is subject to the primary
	supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
	United States persons have the authority to control all
	substantial decisions of the trust or (B) has a valid
	election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be
	treated as a United States person. A

	non-U.S. Holder

	is a holder (other than a partnership) that is not a
	U.S. Holder.


	 


	If a partnership holds common units, the tax treatment of a
	partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status
	of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are
	a partner of a partnership holding our common units, you should
	consult your tax advisors. This discussion does not constitute
	tax advice and is not intended to be a substitute for tax
	planning.


	 



	Prospective holders of common units should consult their own
	tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax and estate tax consequences in their particular
	situations of the purchase, ownership and disposition of a
	common unit, as well as any consequences under the laws of any
	other taxing jurisdiction.



	 




	Taxation
	of our Partnership and the Carlyle Holdings
	Partnerships




	 


	Subject to the discussion set forth in the next paragraph, an
	entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no
	U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner is
	required to take into account its allocable share of items of
	income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership in computing
	its U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of
	whether or not cash distributions are then made. Investors in
	this offering will





	287








	 






	 



	become limited partners of The Carlyle Group L.P. Distributions
	of cash by a partnership to a partner are generally not taxable
	unless the amount of cash distributed to a partner is in excess
	of the partners adjusted basis in its partnership interest.


	 


	An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be
	taxable as a corporation if it is a publicly traded
	partnership, unless an exception applies. An entity that
	would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly
	traded partnership if (i) interests in the partnership are
	traded on an established securities market or
	(ii) interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a
	secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. We will
	be publicly traded. However, an exception to taxation as a
	corporation, referred to as the Qualifying Income
	Exception, exists if at least 90% of such
	partnerships gross income for every taxable year consists
	of qualifying income and the partnership is not
	required to register under the 1940 Act. Qualifying income
	includes certain interest income, dividends, real property
	rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real
	property, and any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital
	asset or other property held for the production of income that
	otherwise constitutes qualifying income. Qualifying income does
	not generally include fees paid in respect of services.


	 


	We expect that allocations of carried interest from investments
	in stock and securities of corporations will typically consist
	of qualifying income because such allocations will generally
	consist of gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset,
	interest and dividends. Income in respect of management,
	advisory and incentive fees as well as income allocations from
	our interest in investments in businesses conducted in
	non-corporate form (such as partnerships or LLCs) will typically
	not constitute qualifying income. We intend to hold investments
	that generate

	non-qualifying

	income separately from our investments that generate qualifying
	income which, include allocations of carried interest from
	investments in stock and securities of corporations. We intend
	to hold investments that earn non-qualifying fee income such as
	management fees, incentive fees and advisory fees, through
	entities classified as corporations for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes including, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and Carlyle
	Holdings III GP L.P. Distributions received from such
	corporations will generally constitute qualifying income.


	 


	Our general partner will adopt a set of investment policies and
	procedures that will govern the types of investments we can make
	(and income we can earn), including structuring certain
	investments through entities classified as corporations for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, to ensure that we will
	meet the Qualifying Income Exception in each taxable year. It is
	the opinion of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP that we
	will be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes based on certain
	assumptions and factual statements and representations made by
	us, including statements and representations as to the manner in
	which we intend to manage our affairs, the composition of our
	income, and that our general partner will ensure that we comply
	with the investment policies and procedures put in place to
	ensure that we meet the Qualifying Income Exception in each
	taxable year. However, this opinion is based solely on current
	law and does not take into account any proposed or potential
	changes in law, which may be enacted with retroactive effect.
	Moreover, opinions of counsel are not binding upon the IRS or
	any court, and the IRS may challenge this conclusion and a court
	may sustain such a challenge.


	 


	If we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, other than a
	failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and that
	is cured within a reasonable time after discovery, or if we are
	required to register under the 1940 Act, we will be treated as
	if we had transferred all of our assets, subject to liabilities,
	to a newly formed corporation, on the first day of the year in
	which we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, in return
	for stock in that corporation, and then distributed the stock to
	the holders of common units in liquidation of their interests in
	us. This deemed contribution and liquidation should generally be
	tax-free to holders so long as we do not have liabilities in
	excess of the tax basis of our assets at that time. Thereafter,
	we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes.




	288








	 






	 



	If we were treated as a corporation in any taxable year, either
	as a result of a failure to meet the Qualifying Income Exception
	or otherwise, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction
	would be reflected only on our tax return rather than being
	passed through to holders of common units, and we would be
	subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our taxable income
	at regular corporate rates, thereby materially reducing the
	amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our
	common units. Distributions made to holders of our common units
	would be treated as either taxable dividend income, which may be
	eligible for reduced rates of taxation, to the extent of our
	current or accumulated earnings and profits, or in the absence
	of earnings and profits, as a nontaxable return of capital, to
	the extent of the holders tax basis in the common units,
	or as taxable capital gain, after the holders basis is
	reduced to zero. In addition, in the case of

	non-U.S. Holders,

	income that we receive with respect to investments may be
	subject to a higher rate of U.S. withholding tax.
	Accordingly, treatment as a corporation could materially reduce
	a holders after-tax return and thus could result in a
	substantial reduction of the value of the common units.


	 


	If at the end of any taxable year we fail to meet the Qualifying
	Income Exception, we may still qualify as a partnership if we
	are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code for an
	inadvertent termination of partnership status. This relief will
	be available if (i) the failure is cured within a
	reasonable time after discovery, (ii) the failure is
	determined by the IRS to be inadvertent, and (iii) we agree
	to make such adjustments (including adjustments with respect to
	our partners) or to pay such amounts as are required by the IRS.
	It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to this
	relief in any or all circumstances. It also is not clear under
	the Internal Revenue Code whether this relief is available for
	our first taxable year as a publicly traded partnership. If this
	relief provision is inapplicable to a particular set of
	circumstances involving us, we will not qualify as a partnership
	for federal income tax purposes. Even if this relief provision
	applies and we retain our partnership status, we or the holders
	of our common units (during the failure period) will be required
	to pay such amounts as are determined by the IRS.


	 


	The remainder of this section assumes that we and the Carlyle
	Holdings partnerships will be treated as partnerships for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	 





	Taxation
	of Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc.





	 


	Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is taxable as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore, as the
	holder of Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc.s common stock, we
	will not be taxed directly on earnings of entities we hold
	through Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. Distributions of cash or
	other property that Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. pays to us will
	constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	to the extent paid from its current or accumulated earnings and
	profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax
	principles). If the amount of a distribution by Carlyle Holdings
	I GP Inc. exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and
	profits, such excess will be treated as a

	tax-free

	return of capital to the extent of our tax basis in Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc.s common stock, and thereafter will be
	treated as a capital gain. We expect to hold certain of our
	entities that are expected to generate income that is not
	qualifying income for purposes of the Qualifying Income
	Exception through Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which is a
	corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so that
	income in respect of such investments will be paid to us as
	distributions from Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. that will
	constitute qualifying income.


	 


	Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. will incur U.S. federal income
	taxes on its proportionate share of any net taxable income of
	Carlyle Holdings I L.P. In accordance with its partnership
	agreement, we will cause Carlyle Holdings I L.P. to distribute
	cash on a pro rata basis to holders of its units (that is,
	Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and our existing owners) in an amount
	at least equal to the maximum tax liabilities arising from their
	ownership of such units, if any.




	289








	 






	 






	Taxation
	of Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C.





	 


	As a single member limited liability company that has not
	elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. will be
	treated as an entity disregarded as a separate entity from us.
	Accordingly, all the assets, liabilities and items of income,
	deduction and credit of Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. will
	be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income,
	deduction and credit.


	 


	We anticipate that Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. will
	invest directly or indirectly in a variety of assets and
	otherwise engage in activities and derive income that is
	consistent with the Qualifying Income Exception discussed above.


	 





	Taxation
	of Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P.





	 


	Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. is a wholly-owned

	société en commandite

	organized in Québec.
	Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. is taxable as a foreign
	corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	Distributions of cash or other property that Carlyle
	Holdings III GP L.P. pays to us will constitute dividends
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid
	from its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as
	determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). If
	the amount of a distribution by Carlyle Holdings III GP
	L.P. exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits,
	such excess will be treated as a tax-free return of capital to
	the extent of our tax basis in Carlyle Holdings III GP
	L.P.s common stock, and thereafter will be treated as a
	capital gain. Income realized by Carlyle Holdings III GP
	L.P. will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the
	extent it has a foreign source and is not treated as ECI.
	Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. is expected to be operated so
	as not to produce ECI. Its assets, liabilities and items of
	income, deduction and credit will not be treated as our assets,
	liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit. We expect
	to hold certain of our entities that are expected to generate
	income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the
	Qualifying Income Exception through Carlyle Holdings III GP
	L.P., which is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, so that income in respect of such entities will be
	paid to us as distributions from Carlyle Holdings III GP
	L.P. that will constitute qualifying income.


	 





	Personal
	Holding Companies





	 


	Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. could be subject to additional
	U.S. federal income tax on a portion of its income if it is
	determined to be a personal holding company, or PHC,
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain
	exceptions, a U.S. corporation generally will be classified
	as a PHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a given
	taxable year if (i) at any time during the last half of
	such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard to
	their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for
	this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt
	organizations and pension funds) own or are deemed to own
	(pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50%
	of the stock of the corporation by value and (ii) at least
	60% of the corporations adjusted ordinary gross income, as
	determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for such
	taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other
	things, dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and, under
	certain circumstances, rents). The PHC rules do not apply to

	non-U.S. corporations.



	 


	Due to applicable attribution rules, it is likely that five or
	fewer individuals or tax-exempt organizations will be treated as
	owning actually or constructively more than 50% of the value of
	units in Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. Consequently, Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc. could be or become a PHC, depending on
	whether it fails the PHC gross income test. If as a factual
	matter, the income of Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. fails the PHC
	gross income test, it will be a PHC. Certain aspects of the
	gross income test cannot be predicted with certainty. Thus, no
	assurance can be given that Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. will not
	become a PHC following this offering or in the future.


	 


	If Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is or were to become a PHC in a
	given taxable year, it would be subject to an additional 15% PHC
	tax on its undistributed PHC income, which generally includes
	the





	290








	 






	 



	companys taxable income, subject to certain adjustments.
	For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, the
	PHC tax rate on undistributed PHC income will be equal to the
	highest marginal rate on ordinary income applicable to
	individuals. If Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. were to become a PHC
	and had significant amounts of undistributed PHC income, the
	amount of PHC tax could be material; in that event, distribution
	of such income would generally reduce the PHC income subject to
	tax.


	 





	Certain
	State, Local and

	Non-U.S.

	Tax
	Matters





	 


	We and our subsidiaries may be subject to state, local or

	non-U.S. taxation

	in various jurisdictions, including those in which we or they
	transact business, own property or reside. For example, we and
	our subsidiaries may be subject to New York City

	and/or

	District of Columbia unincorporated business tax. We may be
	required to file tax returns in some or all of those
	jurisdictions. The state, local or

	non-U.S. tax

	treatment of us and our common unitholders may not conform to
	the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed herein. We
	will pay

	non-U.S. taxes,

	and dispositions of foreign property or operations involving, or
	investments in, foreign property may give rise to

	non-U.S. income

	or other tax liability in amounts that could be substantial. Any

	non-U.S. taxes

	incurred by us may not pass through to common unitholders as a
	credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability.


	 




	Consequences
	to U.S. Holders of Common Units




	 


	The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal
	income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a
	U.S. Holder of common units.


	 


	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, your allocable share
	of our recognized items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
	credit, and our allocable share of those items of Carlyle
	Holdings, will be determined by the limited partnership
	agreements for our partnership and Carlyle Holdings if such
	allocations have substantial economic effect or are
	determined to be in accordance with your interest in our
	partnership. We believe that for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, such allocations will be given effect as being in
	accordance with your interest in The Carlyle Group L.P., and our
	general partner intends to prepare tax returns based on such
	allocations. If the IRS successfully challenges the allocations
	made pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, the
	resulting allocations for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	might be less favorable than the allocations set forth in the
	limited partnership agreements.


	 


	With respect to U.S. Holders who are individuals, certain
	dividends paid by a corporation, including certain qualified
	foreign corporations, to us and that are allocable to such
	U.S. Holders prior to January 1, 2013 may be
	subject to reduced rates of taxation. A qualified foreign
	corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for
	the benefits of specified income tax treaties with the United
	States. In addition, a foreign corporation is treated as a
	qualified corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an
	established securities market in the United States. We do not
	expect that Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. will be a
	qualified foreign corporation for purposes of the reduced rates
	of taxation on dividends. Among other exceptions, a
	U.S. Holder who is an individual will not be eligible for
	reduced rates of taxation on any dividend if the payer is a PFIC
	(as defined below) in the taxable year in which such dividend is
	paid or in the preceding taxable year or on any income required
	to be reported by the U.S. Holder as a result of a QEF
	election (as defined below) that is attributable to a dividend
	received by an entity that is a PFIC and in which the fund holds
	a direct or indirect interest. Prospective investors should
	consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the
	foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.


	 


	We may derive taxable income from an investment that is not
	matched by a corresponding distribution of cash. This could
	occur, for example, if we used cash to make an investment or to
	reduce debt instead of distributing profits. In addition,
	special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may be
	applicable to certain of our investments, and may affect the
	timing of our income,





	291








	 






	 



	requiring us (and, consequently, you) to recognize taxable
	income before we (or you) receive cash attributable to such
	income. Accordingly, it is possible that your U.S. federal
	income tax liability with respect to your allocable share of our
	income for a particular taxable year could exceed any cash
	distribution you receive for the year, thus giving rise to an

	out-of-pocket

	tax liability for you.


	 





	Basis





	 


	You will have an initial tax basis for your common unit equal to
	the amount you paid for the common unit plus your share under
	the partnership tax rules of our liabilities, if any. That basis
	will be increased by your share of our income and by increases
	in your share of our liabilities, if any. That basis will be
	decreased, but not below zero, by distributions from us, by your
	share of our losses and by any decrease in your share of our
	liabilities.


	 


	Holders who purchase common units in separate transactions must
	combine the basis of those units and maintain a single adjusted
	tax basis for all those units. Upon a sale or other disposition
	of less than all of the common units, a portion of that tax
	basis must be allocated to the common units sold.


	 





	Limits
	on Deductions for Losses and Expenses





	 


	Your deduction of your share of our losses will be limited to
	your tax basis in your common units and, if you are an
	individual or a corporate holder that is subject to the at
	risk rules, to the amount for which you are considered to
	be at risk with respect to our activities, if that
	is less than your tax basis. In general, you will be at risk to
	the extent of your tax basis in your common units, reduced by
	(1) the portion of that basis attributable to your share of
	our liabilities for which you will not be personally liable and
	(2) any amount of money you borrow to acquire or hold your
	common units, if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an
	interest in us, is related to you or can look only to the common
	units for repayment. Your at risk amount generally will increase
	by your allocable share of our income and gain and decrease by
	cash distributions to you and your allocable share of losses and
	deductions. You must recapture losses deducted in previous years
	to the extent that distributions cause your at risk amount to be
	less than zero at the end of any taxable year. Losses disallowed
	or recaptured as a result of these limitations will carry
	forward and will be allowable to the extent that your tax basis
	or at risk amount, whichever is the limiting factor,
	subsequently increases. Any excess loss above that gain
	previously suspended by the at risk or basis limitations may no
	longer be used.


	 


	We do not expect to generate income or losses from passive
	activities for purposes of Section 469 of the
	Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, income allocated to you by
	us may not be offset by your Section 469 passive losses and
	losses allocated to you generally may not be used to offset your
	Section 469 passive income. In addition, other provisions
	of the Internal Revenue Code may limit or disallow any deduction
	for losses by you or deductions associated with certain assets
	of the partnership in certain cases, including potentially
	Section 470 of the Internal Revenue Code. You should
	consult with your tax advisors regarding their limitations on
	the deductibility of losses under applicable sections of the
	Internal Revenue Code.


	 





	Limitations
	on Deductibility of Organizational Expenses and Syndication
	Fees





	 


	In general, neither we nor any U.S. Holder may deduct
	organizational or syndication expenses. An election may be made
	by our partnership to amortize organizational expenses over a

	15-year

	period. Syndication fees (which would include any sales or
	placement fees or commissions or underwriting discount payable
	to third parties) must be capitalized and cannot be amortized or
	otherwise deducted.


	 





	Limitations
	on Interest Deductions





	 


	Your share of our interest expense is likely to be treated as
	investment interest expense. If you are a
	non-corporate U.S. Holder, the deductibility of
	investment interest expense is generally





	292








	 






	 



	limited to the amount of your net investment income.
	Your share of our dividend and interest income will be treated
	as investment income, although qualified dividend
	income subject to reduced rates of tax in the hands of an
	individual will only be treated as investment income if you
	elect to treat such dividend as ordinary income not subject to
	reduced rates of tax. In addition, state and local tax laws may
	disallow deductions for your share of our interest expense.


	 


	The computation of your investment interest expense will take
	into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other
	loan incurred to purchase a common unit. Net investment income
	includes gross income from property held for investment and
	amounts treated as portfolio income, such as dividends and
	interest, under the passive loss rules less deductible expenses,
	other than interest, directly connected with the production of
	investment income, but generally does not include gains
	attributable to the disposition of property held for investment.
	For this purpose, any long-term capital gain or qualifying
	dividend income that is taxable at long-term capital gain rates
	is excluded from net investment income, unless the
	U.S. holder elects to pay tax on such gain or dividend
	income at ordinary income rates.


	 





	Deductibility
	of Partnership Investment Expenditures by Individual Partners
	and by Trusts and Estates





	 


	Subject to certain exceptions, all miscellaneous itemized
	deductions of an individual taxpayer, and certain of such
	deductions of an estate or trust, are deductible only to the
	extent that such deductions exceed 2% of the taxpayers
	adjusted gross income. Moreover, for taxable years beginning on
	or after January 1, 2013, the otherwise allowable itemized
	deductions of individuals whose gross income exceeds an
	applicable threshold amount are subject to reduction by an
	amount equal to the lesser of (1) 3% of the excess of the
	individuals adjusted gross income over the threshold
	amount, or (2) 80% of the amount of the itemized
	deductions. The operating expenses of Carlyle Holdings,
	including the management fee and management fees paid with
	respect to private funds advised by Carlyle to the extent these
	private funds are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, may be treated as miscellaneous itemized
	deductions subject to the foregoing rule. Alternatively, it is
	possible that we will be required to capitalize the management
	fees. Accordingly, if you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder,
	you should consult your tax advisors with respect to the
	application of these limitations.


	 





	Treatment
	of Distributions





	 


	Distributions of cash by us will not be taxable to you to the
	extent of your adjusted tax basis (described above) in your
	common units. Any cash distributions in excess of your adjusted
	tax basis will be considered to be gain from the sale or
	exchange of common units (described below). Under current laws,
	such gain would be treated as capital gain and would be
	long-term capital gain if your holding period for your common
	units exceeds one year, subject to certain exceptions (described
	below). A reduction in your allocable share of our liabilities,
	and certain distributions of marketable securities by us, are
	treated similar to cash distributions for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes.


	 





	Sale
	or Exchange of Common Units





	 


	You will recognize gain or loss on a sale of common units equal
	to the difference, if any, between the amount realized and your
	tax basis in the common units sold. Your amount realized will be
	measured by the sum of the cash or the fair market value of
	other property received plus your share under the partnership
	tax rules of our liabilities, if any. Your adjusted tax basis
	will be adjusted for this purpose by your allocable share of our
	income or loss for the year of such sale or other disposition.


	 


	Gain or loss recognized by you on the sale or exchange of a
	common unit generally will be taxable as capital gain or loss
	and will be long-term capital gain or loss if all of the common
	units you hold were held for more than one year on the date of
	such sale or exchange. Assuming we have





	293








	 






	 



	not made an election, referred to as a QEF election,
	to treat our interest in a PFIC as a qualified electing
	fund, or QEF, gain attributable to such
	investment in a PFIC would be taxable as ordinary income and
	would be subject to an interest charge. See
	 Passive Foreign Investment Companies. In
	addition, certain gain attributable to our investment in a
	controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, may be characterized as
	ordinary income and certain gain attributable to
	unrealized receivables or inventory
	items would be characterized as ordinary income rather
	than capital gain. For example, if we hold debt acquired at a
	market discount, accrued market discount on such debt would be
	treated as unrealized receivables. The deductibility
	of capital losses is subject to limitations.


	 


	Holders who purchase units at different times and intend to sell
	all or a portion of the units within a year of their most recent
	purchase are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
	application of certain split holding period rules to
	them and the treatment of any gain or loss as long-term or
	short-term capital gain or loss.


	 





	Foreign
	Tax Credit Limitations





	 


	You generally will be entitled to a foreign tax credit with
	respect to your allocable share of creditable foreign taxes paid
	on our income and gains. Complex rules may, depending on your
	particular circumstances, limit the availability or use of
	foreign tax credits. Gains from the sale of our investments may
	be treated as U.S. source gains. Consequently, you may not
	be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any foreign
	taxes imposed on such gains unless such credit can be applied
	(subject to applicable limitations) against tax due on other
	income treated as derived from foreign sources. Certain losses
	that we incur may be treated as foreign source losses, which
	could reduce the amount of foreign tax credits otherwise
	available.


	 





	Section 754
	Election





	 


	We currently do not intend to make the election permitted by
	Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to us
	or Carlyle Holdings II L.P. Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and
	Carlyle Holdings III L.P. currently intend to make such an
	election. The election, if made, is irrevocable without the
	consent of the IRS and would generally require the electing
	partnership to adjust the tax basis in its assets, or
	inside basis, attributable to a transferee of
	interests in the electing partnership under Section 743(b)
	of the Internal Revenue Code to reflect the purchase price of
	such interests paid by the transferee. If Carlyle Holdings I
	L.P. or Carlyle Holdings III L.P. makes a Section 754
	election as intended, then Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and
	Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P., respectively, would be
	required to adjust the basis in their assets attributable to
	interests in Carlyle Holding I L.P. acquired by Carlyle Holdings
	I GP Inc. and interests in Carlyle Holdings III L.P.
	acquired by Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. from the limited
	partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and Carlyle
	Holdings III L.P. pursuant to the Exchange Agreement
	described under Certain Relationships and Related Person
	Transactions  Exchange Agreement. If, as
	intended, we do not make the Section 754 election with
	respect to us, no similar adjustment to basis in assets owned
	directly or indirectly by us attributable to common units
	acquired by transferees would be made. Because we own our
	interests in Carlyle Holdings I L.P. indirectly through Carlyle
	Holdings I GP Inc., a corporation for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes, and our interests in Carlyle Holdings III
	L.P. indirectly though Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P., a
	corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there will be
	no adjustment to the inside basis for a transferee of common
	units in respect of Carlyle Holdings I L.P. or Carlyle
	Holdings III L.P. regardless of whether a Section 754
	election is made in respect of us or those partnerships.


	 


	If no Section 754 election is made by us and Carlyle
	Holdings II L.P., there will be no adjustment for the
	transferee of common units, even if the purchase price of those
	common units is higher than the common units share of the
	aggregate tax basis of our assets or the assets of Carlyle
	Holdings II L.P. immediately prior to the transfer. In that
	case, on a sale of any such asset, gain allocable to the
	transferee would include built-in gain allocable to the
	transferee at the time of the





	294








	 






	 



	transfer, which built-in gain would otherwise generally be
	eliminated if we and Carlyle Holdings II L.P. had made a
	Section 754 election.


	 


	Even assuming no Section 754 election is made, if common
	units are transferred at a time when we had a substantial
	built-in loss inherent in our assets, we would be
	obligated to reduce the tax basis in the portion of such assets
	attributable to such common units.


	 


	The calculations under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue
	Code are complex. We will make them on the basis of assumptions
	as to the value of our assets and other matters.


	 





	Uniformity
	of Common Units





	 


	Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common
	units, we will adopt depreciation, amortization and other tax
	accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of
	existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to
	those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax
	benefits available to our common unitholders. It also could
	affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on
	the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the
	value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments
	to our common unitholders tax returns.


	 





	Foreign
	Currency Gain or Loss





	 


	Our functional currency will be the U.S. dollar, and our
	income or loss will be calculated in U.S. dollars. It is
	likely that we will recognize foreign currency gain
	or loss with respect to transactions involving

	non-U.S. dollar

	currencies. In general, foreign currency gain or loss is treated
	as ordinary income or loss. You should consult your tax advisor
	with respect to the tax treatment of foreign currency gain or
	loss.


	 





	Passive
	Foreign Investment Companies





	 


	You may be subject to special rules applicable to indirect
	investments in foreign corporations, including an investment in
	a PFIC. Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. will be subject to rules
	similar to those described below with respect to any PFICs owned
	directly or indirectly by it.


	 


	A PFIC is defined as any foreign corporation with respect to
	which either (1) 75% or more of the gross income for a
	taxable year is passive income (as defined in
	Section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code and the
	regulations promulgated thereunder) or (2) 50% or more of
	its assets in any taxable year (generally based on the quarterly
	average of the value of its assets) produce passive
	income. There are no minimum stock ownership requirements
	for PFICs. Once a corporation qualifies as a PFIC it is, subject
	to certain exceptions, always treated as a PFIC, regardless of
	whether it satisfies either of the qualification tests in
	subsequent years. Any gain on disposition of stock of a PFIC, as
	well as income realized on certain excess
	distributions by the PFIC, is treated as though realized
	ratably over the shorter of your holding period of common units
	or our holding period for the PFIC. Such gain or income is
	taxable as ordinary income and, as discussed above, dividends
	paid by a PFIC to an individual will not be eligible for the
	reduced rates of taxation that are available for certain
	qualifying dividends. In addition, an interest charge would be
	imposed on you based on the tax deferred from prior years.


	 


	Although it may not always be possible, we expect to make a QEF
	election where possible with respect to each entity treated as a
	PFIC to treat such

	non-U.S. entity

	as a QEF in the first year we hold shares in such entity.
	However, we expect that in many circumstances we may not have
	access to information necessary to make a QEF election because,
	for example, one of our investment funds may hold minority
	interests directly or indirectly in an entity over which we have
	no control. A QEF election is effective for our taxable year for
	which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years and
	may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If we make a
	QEF election under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to our
	interest in a PFIC, in lieu of the foregoing treatment, we





	295








	 






	 



	would be required to include in income each year a portion of
	the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the QEF called
	QEF Inclusions, even if not distributed to us. Thus,
	holders may be required to report taxable income as a result of
	QEF Inclusions without corresponding receipts of cash. However,
	a holder may elect to defer, until the occurrence of certain
	events, payment of the U.S. federal income tax attributable
	to QEF Inclusions for which no current distributions are
	received, but will be required to pay interest on the deferred
	tax computed by using the statutory rate of interest applicable
	to an extension of time for payment of tax. However, net losses
	(if any) of a

	non-U.S. entity

	owned through Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. that is treated
	as a PFIC will not pass through to us or to holders and may not
	be carried back or forward in computing such PFICs
	ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years.
	Consequently, holders may over time be taxed on amounts that as
	an economic matter exceed our net profits. Our tax basis in the
	shares of such

	non-U.S. entities,

	and a holders basis in our common units, will be increased
	to reflect QEF Inclusions. No portion of the QEF Inclusion
	attributable to ordinary income will be eligible for reduced
	rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income of
	individual U.S. Holders. Amounts included as QEF Inclusions
	with respect to direct and indirect investments generally will
	not be taxed again when distributed. You should consult your tax
	advisors as to the manner in which QEF Inclusions affect your
	allocable share of our income and your basis in your common
	units.


	 


	Alternatively, in the case of a PFIC that is a publicly-traded
	foreign portfolio company, we may make an election to mark
	to market the stock of such foreign portfolio company on
	an annual basis. Pursuant to such an election, you would include
	in each year as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair
	market value of such stock over its adjusted basis at the end of
	the taxable year. You may treat as ordinary loss any excess of
	the adjusted basis of the stock over its fair market value at
	the end of the year, but only to the extent of the net amount
	previously included in income as a result of the election in
	prior years.


	 


	When making investment or other decisions, we will consider
	whether an investment will be a PFIC and the tax consequences
	related thereto. We may make certain investments, including for
	instance investments in specialized investment funds or
	investments in funds of funds through

	non-U.S. corporate

	subsidiaries of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships or through
	other

	non-U.S. corporations.

	Such entities may be a PFICs for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. In addition, certain of our investments could be in
	PFICs. Thus, we can make no assurance that some of our
	investments will not be treated as held through a PFIC or as
	interests in PFICs or that such PFICs will be eligible for the
	mark to market election, or that as to any such
	PFICs we will be able to make QEF elections.


	 


	If we do not make a QEF election with respect to a PFIC,
	Section 1291 of the Internal Revenue Code will treat all
	gain on a disposition by us of shares of such entity, gain on
	the disposition of common units by a holder at a time when we
	own shares of such entity, as well as certain other defined
	excess distributions, as if the gain or excess
	distribution were ordinary income earned ratably over the
	shorter of the period during which the holder held its common
	units or the period during which we held our shares in such
	entity. For gain and excess distributions allocated to prior
	years, (i) the tax rate will be the highest in effect for
	that taxable year and (ii) the tax will be payable
	generally without regard to offsets from deductions, losses and
	expenses. Holders will also be subject to an interest charge for
	any deferred tax. No portion of this ordinary income will be
	eligible for the favorable tax rate applicable to
	qualified dividend income for individual
	U.S. persons.


	 





	Controlled
	Foreign Corporations





	 


	A

	non-U.S. entity

	will be treated as a CFC if it is treated as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes and if more than 50% of
	(i) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
	of the

	non-U.S. entity

	entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of
	the

	non-U.S. entity

	is owned by U.S. Shareholders on any day during the taxable
	year of such

	non-U.S. entity.

	For purposes of this discussion, a
	U.S. Shareholder with respect to a

	non-U.S. entity

	means a U.S. person that owns 10% or more of the total
	combined voting power of all classes of stock of the

	non-U.S. entity

	entitled to vote.




	296








	 






	 



	When making investment or other decisions, we will consider
	whether an investment will be a CFC and the consequences related
	thereto. If we are a U.S. Shareholder in a

	non-U.S. entity

	that is treated as a CFC, each common unitholder may be required
	to include in income its allocable share of the CFCs
	Subpart F income reported by us. Subpart F income
	generally includes dividends, interest, net gain from the sale
	or disposition of securities, non-actively managed rents, fees
	for services provided to certain related persons and certain
	other generally passive types of income. The aggregate Subpart F
	income inclusions in any taxable year relating to a particular
	CFC are limited to such entitys current earnings and
	profits. These inclusions are treated as ordinary income
	(whether or not such inclusions are attributable to net capital
	gains). Thus, an investor may be required to report as ordinary
	income its allocable share of the CFCs Subpart F income
	reported by us without corresponding receipts of cash and may
	not benefit from capital gain treatment with respect to the
	portion of our earnings (if any) attributable to net capital
	gains of the CFC.


	 


	The tax basis of our shares of such

	non-U.S. entity,

	and a holders tax basis in our common units, will be
	increased to reflect any required Subpart F income inclusions.
	Such income will be treated as income from sources within the
	United States, for certain foreign tax credit purposes, to the
	extent derived by the CFC from U.S. sources. Such income
	will not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax applicable to
	qualified dividend income for individual
	U.S. persons. See  Consequences to
	U.S. Holders of Common Units. Amounts included as
	such income with respect to direct and indirect investments
	generally will not be taxable again when distributed.


	 


	Regardless of whether any CFC has Subpart F income, any gain
	allocated to you from our disposition of stock in a CFC will be
	treated as ordinary income to the extent of your allocable share
	of the current

	and/or

	accumulated earnings and profits of the CFC. In this regard,
	earnings would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant
	to the CFC rules. However, net losses (if any) of a

	non-U.S. entity

	owned by us that is treated as a CFC will not pass through to
	you. Moreover, a portion of your gain from the sale or exchange
	of your common units may be treated as ordinary income. Any
	portion of any gain from the sale or exchange of a common unit
	that is attributable to a CFC may be treated as an
	unrealized receivable taxable as ordinary income.
	See  Sale or Exchange of Common Units.


	 


	If a

	non-U.S. entity

	held by us is classified as both a CFC and a PFIC during the
	time we are a U.S. Shareholder of such

	non-U.S. entity,

	a holder will be required to include amounts in income with
	respect to such

	non-U.S. entity

	pursuant to this subheading, and the consequences described
	under the subheading Passive Foreign Investment
	Companies above will not apply. If our ownership
	percentage in a

	non-U.S. entity

	changes such that we are not a U.S. Shareholder with
	respect to such

	non-U.S. entity,

	then common unitholders may be subject to the PFIC rules. The
	interaction of these rules is complex, and prospective holders
	are urged to consult their tax advisors in this regard.


	 


	It is expected that Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. will be a
	CFC subject to the above rules and as such, each common
	unitholder that is a U.S. person will be required to
	include in income its allocable share of Carlyle
	Holdings III GP L.P.s Subpart F income reported by us.


	 





	Investment
	Structure





	 


	To manage our affairs so as to meet the Qualifying Income
	Exception for the publicly traded partnership rules (discussed
	above) and comply with certain requirements in our Limited
	Partnership Agreement, we may need to structure certain
	investments through an entity classified as a corporation for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because our
	common unitholders will be located in numerous taxing
	jurisdictions, no assurances can be given that any such
	investment structure will be beneficial to all our common
	unitholders to the same extent, and may even impose additional
	tax burdens on some of our common unitholders. As discussed
	above, if the entity were a

	non-U.S. corporation

	it may be considered a CFC or a PFIC. If the entity were a
	U.S. corporation, it would be subject to U.S. federal
	income tax on its operating income, including any gain
	recognized





	297








	 






	 



	on its disposal of its investments. In addition, if the
	investment involves U.S. real estate, gain recognized on
	disposition would generally be subject to such tax, whether the
	corporation is a U.S. or a

	non-U.S. corporation.



	 





	Taxes
	in Other State, Local and

	Non-U.S.

	Jurisdictions





	 


	In addition to U.S. federal income tax consequences, you
	may be subject to potential U.S. state and local taxes
	because of an investment in us in the U.S. state or
	locality in which you are a resident for tax purposes or in
	which we have investments or activities. You may also be subject
	to tax return filing obligations and income, franchise or other
	taxes, including withholding taxes, in state, local or

	non-U.S. jurisdictions

	in which we invest, or in which entities in which we own
	interests conduct activities or derive income. Income or gains
	from investments held by us may be subject to withholding or
	other taxes in jurisdictions outside the United States, subject
	to the possibility of reduction under applicable income tax
	treaties. If you wish to claim the benefit of an applicable
	income tax treaty, you may be required to submit information to
	tax authorities in such jurisdictions. You should consult your
	own tax advisors regarding the U.S. state, local and

	non-U.S. tax

	consequences of an investment in us.


	 





	Transferor/Transferee
	Allocations





	 


	In general, our taxable income and losses will be determined and
	apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as
	consistent with applicable law. As a result, if you transfer
	your common units, you may be allocated income, gain, loss and
	deduction realized by us after the date of transfer. Similarly,
	a transferee may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction
	realized by us prior to the date of the transferees
	acquisition of our common units.


	 


	Although Section 706 of the Internal Revenue Code generally
	provides guidelines for allocations of items of partnership
	income and deductions between transferors and transferees of
	partnership interests, it is not clear that our allocation
	method complies with its requirements. If our convention were
	not permitted, the IRS might contend that our taxable income or
	losses must be reallocated among the investors. If such a
	contention were sustained, your respective tax liabilities would
	be adjusted to your possible detriment. Our general partner is
	authorized to revise our method of allocation between
	transferors and transferees (as well as among investors whose
	interests otherwise vary during a taxable period).


	 





	U.S.
	Federal Estate Taxes





	 


	If common units are included in the gross estate of a
	U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal estate tax
	purposes, then a U.S. federal estate tax might be payable
	in connection with the death of such person. Prospective
	individual U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
	advisors concerning the potential U.S. federal estate tax
	consequences with respect to our common units.


	 




	U.S.
	Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Holders of Common Units




	 


	A holder of common units that is a tax-exempt organization for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore generally
	exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, may nevertheless
	be subject to unrelated business income tax, or UBTI, to the
	extent, if any, that its allocable share of our income consists
	of UBTI. A tax-exempt partner of a partnership that regularly
	engages in a trade or business which is unrelated to the exempt
	function of the tax-exempt partner must include in computing its
	UBTI its pro rata share (whether or not distributed) of such
	partnerships gross income derived from such unrelated
	trade or business. Moreover, a tax-exempt partner of a
	partnership could be treated as earning UBTI to the extent that
	such partnership derives income from debt-financed
	property, or if the partnership interest itself is debt
	financed. Debt-financed property means property held to produce
	income with respect to which there is acquisition
	indebtedness (that is, indebtedness incurred in acquiring
	or holding property).




	298








	 






	 



	While we do not expect to generate significant amounts of UBTI
	for tax-exempt Holders of our common units as a result of direct
	investments in operating businesses, certain of our investments
	may be treated as debt-financed investments, which may give rise
	to debt-financed UBTI. Accordingly, no assurance can be given
	that we will not generate UBTI currently or in the future and,
	subject to the qualifying income rules described under
	Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations 
	Taxation of our Partnership and the Carlyle Holdings
	Partnerships, we are under no obligation to minimize UBTI.
	Tax-exempt U.S. Holders of common units should consult with
	their own tax advisors regarding all aspects of UBTI.


	 




	Investments
	by U.S. Mutual Funds




	 


	U.S. mutual funds that are treated as regulated investment
	companies, or RICs, for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	are required, among other things, to meet an annual 90% gross
	income and a quarterly 50% asset value test under
	Section 851(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to maintain
	their favorable U.S. federal income tax status. The
	treatment of an investment by a RIC in common units for purposes
	of these tests will depend on whether we are treated as a
	qualifying publicly traded partnership. If our
	partnership is so treated, then the common units themselves are
	the relevant assets for purposes of the 50% asset value test and
	the net income from the common units is the relevant gross
	income for purposes of the 90% gross income test. RICs may not
	invest greater than 25% of their assets in one or more
	qualifying publicly traded partnerships. All income derived from
	a qualifying publicly traded partnership is considered
	qualifying income for purposes of the RIC 90% gross income test
	above. However, if we are not treated as a qualifying publicly
	traded partnership for purposes of the RIC rules, then the
	relevant assets for the RIC asset test will be the RICs
	allocable share of the underlying assets held by us and the
	relevant gross income for the RIC income test will be the
	RICs allocable share of the underlying gross income earned
	by us. Whether we will qualify as a qualifying publicly
	traded partnership depends on the exact nature of our
	future investments, but it is likely that we will not be treated
	as a qualifying publicly traded partnership. In
	addition, as discussed above under
	 Consequences to U.S. Holders of Common
	Units, we may derive taxable income from an investment
	that is not matched by a corresponding cash distribution.
	Accordingly, a RIC investing in our common units may recognize
	income for U.S. federal income tax purposes without
	receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts
	necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements under
	Section 852 and 4982 of the Internal Revenue Code for
	avoiding income and excise taxes. RICs should consult their own
	tax advisors about the U.S. tax consequences of an
	investment in common units.


	 




	Consequences
	to

	Non-U.S.

	Holders of Common Units




	 





	U.S.
	Income Tax Consequences





	 


	In light of our intended investment activities, we generally do
	not expect to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or
	business or to generate significant amounts of ECI for

	non-U.S. Holders

	of our common units. However, there can be no assurance that we
	will not generate ECI currently or in the future and, subject to
	the qualifying income rules described under Material
	U.S. Federal Tax Considerations  Taxation of our
	Partnership and the Carlyle Holdings Partnerships, we are
	under no obligation to minimize ECI. Moreover there can be no
	assurance that the IRS will not successfully assert that we are
	engaged in a U.S. trade or business such that some portion
	of our income is properly treated as ECI. If a

	non-U.S. Holder

	were treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business
	in any year because of an investment in our common units in such
	year, such

	non-U.S. Holder

	generally would be (1) subject to withholding by us on any
	actual distributions, (2) required to file a
	U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting its
	allocable share, if any, of income or loss effectively connected
	with such trade or business, including certain income from
	U.S. sources not related to The Carlyle Group L.P. and
	(3) required to pay U.S. federal income tax at regular
	U.S. federal income tax rates on any such income. Moreover,
	a corporate

	non-U.S. Holder

	might be subject to a U.S. branch profits tax on its
	allocable share of our ECI. Any amount so withheld would be
	creditable against such

	non-U.S. Holders






	299








	 






	 



	U.S. federal income tax liability, and such

	non-U.S. Holder

	could claim a refund to the extent that the amount withheld
	exceeded such

	non-U.S. Holders

	U.S. federal income tax liability for the taxable year.
	Finally, if we were treated as being engaged in a
	U.S. trade or business, a portion of any gain recognized by
	a holder who is a

	non-U.S. Holder

	on the sale or exchange of its common units could be treated for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes as ECI, and hence such

	non-U.S. Holder

	could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the sale or
	exchange of our common units.


	 


	Generally, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act
	of 1980 (FIRPTA) provisions of the Internal Revenue
	Code,

	non-U.S. persons

	are subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner
	as U.S. persons on any gain realized on the disposition of
	an interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, in
	U.S. real property. An interest in U.S. real property
	includes stock in a U.S. corporation (except for certain
	stock of publicly traded U.S. corporations) if interests in
	U.S. real property constitute 50% or more by value of the
	sum of the corporations assets used in a trade or
	business, its U.S. real property interests and its
	interests in real property located outside the United States (a
	United States Real Property Holding Corporation or
	USRPHC). The FIRPTA tax applies if a

	non-U.S. person

	is a holder of an interest in a partnership that realizes gain
	in respect of an interest in U.S. real property or an
	interest in a USRPHC. We may, from time to time, make certain
	investments (other than direct investments in U.S. real
	property), for example, through one of our investment funds held
	by Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. that could constitute
	investments in U.S. real property or USRPHCs. If we make
	such investments, each

	non-U.S. Holder

	will be subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA on
	such holders allocable share of any gain we realize on the
	disposition of a FIRPTA interest and will be subject to the tax
	return filing requirements regarding ECI discussed above.


	 


	Although each

	non-U.S. Holder

	is required to provide an IRS

	Form W-8,

	we may not be able to provide complete information related to
	the tax status of our investors to Carlyle Holdings for purposes
	of obtaining reduced rates of withholding on behalf of our
	investors. Accordingly, to the extent we receive dividends from
	a U.S. corporation through Carlyle Holdings and its
	investment vehicles, your allocable share of distributions of
	such dividend income will be subject to U.S. withholding
	tax at a 30% rate, unless relevant tax status information is
	provided. Distributions to you may also be subject to
	withholding to the extent they are attributable to the sale of a
	U.S. real property interest or if the distribution is
	otherwise considered fixed or determinable annual or periodic
	income under the Internal Revenue Code, provided that an
	exemption from or a reduced rate of such withholding may apply
	if certain tax status information is provided. If such
	information is not provided and you would not be subject to
	U.S. tax based on your tax status or are eligible for a
	reduced rate of U.S. withholding, you may need to take
	additional steps to receive a credit or refund of any excess
	withholding tax paid on your account, which may include the
	filing of a non-resident U.S. income tax return with the
	IRS. Among other limitations, if you reside in a treaty
	jurisdiction which does not treat our partnership as a
	pass-through entity, you may not be eligible to receive a refund
	or credit of excess U.S. withholding taxes paid on your
	account. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the
	treatment of U.S. withholding taxes.


	 


	Special rules may apply in the case of a

	non-U.S. Holder

	that (1) has an office or fixed place of business in the
	U.S., (2) is present in the U.S. for 183 days or
	more in a taxable year or (3) is a former citizen of the
	U.S., a foreign insurance company that is treated as holding a
	partnership interests in us in connection with their
	U.S. business, a PFIC or a corporation that accumulates
	earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax. You should
	consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these
	special rules.


	 





	U.S.
	Federal Estate Tax Consequences





	 


	The U.S. federal estate tax treatment of our common units
	with regards to the estate of a

	non-citizen

	who is not a resident of the United States is not entirely
	clear. If our common units are includable in the U.S. gross
	estate of such person, then a U.S. federal estate tax might
	be payable in connection with the death of such person.
	Prospective individual

	non-U.S. Holders

	who are





	300








	 






	 




	non-citizens

	and not residents of the United States should consult their own
	tax advisors concerning the potential U.S. federal estate
	tax consequences with regard to our units.


	 




	Administrative
	Matters




	 





	Taxable
	Year





	 


	We currently intend to use the calendar year as our taxable year
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under certain
	circumstances which we currently believe are unlikely to apply,
	a taxable year other than the calendar year may be required for
	such purposes.


	 





	Tax
	Matters Partner





	 


	Our general partner will act as our tax matters
	partner. As the tax matters partner, the general partner
	will have the authority, subject to certain restrictions, to act
	on our behalf in connection with any administrative or judicial
	review of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit.


	 





	Information
	Returns





	 


	We have agreed to furnish to you, as soon as reasonably
	practicable after the close of each calendar year, tax
	information (including

	Schedule K-1),

	which describes on a U.S. dollar basis your share of our
	income, gain, loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year.
	Although we currently intend to distribute

	Schedule K-1s

	on or around 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, it
	may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal
	year to obtain the requisite information from all lower-tier
	entities so that K-1s may be prepared for us. Consequently,
	holders of common units who are U.S. taxpayers should
	anticipate that they may need to file annually with the IRS (and
	certain states) a request for an extension past April 15 or the
	otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the
	taxable year. In addition, each partner will be required to
	report for all tax purposes consistently with the information
	provided by us for the taxable year.


	 


	In preparing this information, we will use various accounting
	and reporting conventions, some of which have been mentioned in
	the previous discussion, to determine your share of income,
	gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may successfully contend that
	certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible, which
	could result in an adjustment to your income or loss.


	 


	We may be audited by the IRS. Adjustments resulting from an IRS
	audit may require you to adjust a prior years tax
	liability and possibly may result in an audit of your own tax
	return. Any audit of your tax return could result in adjustments
	not related to our tax returns as well as those related to our
	tax returns.


	 





	Tax
	Shelter Regulations





	 


	If we were to engage in a reportable transaction, we
	(and possibly you and others) would be required to make a
	detailed disclosure of the transaction to the IRS in accordance
	with recently issued regulations governing tax shelters and
	other potentially tax-motivated transactions. A transaction may
	be a reportable transaction based upon any of several factors,
	including the fact that it is a type of tax avoidance
	transaction publicly identified by the IRS as a listed
	transaction or that it produces certain kinds of losses in
	excess of $2 million. An investment in us may be considered
	a reportable transaction if, for example, we
	recognize certain significant losses in the future. In certain
	circumstances, a common unitholder who disposes of an interest
	in a transaction resulting in the recognition by such holder of
	significant losses in excess of certain threshold amounts may be
	obligated to disclose its participation in such transaction. Our
	participation in a reportable transaction also could increase
	the likelihood that our U.S. federal income tax information
	return (and possibly your tax return) would be audited by the
	IRS. Certain of these rules are currently unclear and it is
	possible that they may be applicable in situations other than
	significant loss transactions.




	301








	 






	 



	Moreover, if we were to participate in a reportable transaction
	with a significant purpose to avoid or evade tax, or in any
	listed transaction, you may be subject to (i) significant
	accuracy-related penalties with a broad scope, (ii) for
	those persons otherwise entitled to deduct interest on federal
	tax deficiencies, non-deductibility of interest on any resulting
	tax liability, and (iii) in the case of a listed
	transaction, an extended statute of limitations.


	 


	Common unitholders should consult their tax advisors concerning
	any possible disclosure obligation under the regulations
	governing tax shelters with respect to the dispositions of their
	interests in us.


	 





	Constructive
	Termination





	 


	Subject to the electing large partnership rules described below,
	we will be considered to have been terminated for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or
	exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital
	and profits within a

	12-month

	period.


	 


	Our termination would result in the close of our taxable year
	for all holders of common units. In the case of a holder
	reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending on
	our year-end, the closing of our taxable year may result in more
	than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being
	includable in the holders taxable income for the year of
	termination. We would be required to make new tax elections
	after a termination, including a new tax election under
	Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code. A termination
	could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine
	that the termination had occurred. Moreover, a termination might
	either accelerate the application of, or subject us to, any tax
	legislation enacted before the termination.


	 





	Elective
	Procedures for Large Partnerships





	 


	The Internal Revenue Code allows large partnerships to elect
	streamlined procedures for income tax reporting. This election
	would reduce the number of items that must be separately stated
	on the Schedules K-1 that are issued to the common unitholders,
	and such Schedules K-1 would have to be provided to common
	unitholders on or before the first March 15 following the close
	of each taxable year. In addition, this election would prevent
	us from suffering a technical termination (which
	would close our taxable year) if within a

	12-month

	period there is a sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of
	our total interests. It is possible we might make such an
	election, if eligible. If we make such election, IRS audit
	adjustments will flow through to holders of the common units for
	the year in which the adjustments take effect, rather than the
	holders of common units in the year to which the adjustment
	relates. In addition, we, rather than the holders of the common
	units individually, generally will be liable for any interest
	and penalties that result from an audit adjustment.


	 





	Treatment
	of Amounts Withheld





	 


	If we are required to withhold any U.S. tax on
	distributions made to any common unitholder, we may pay such
	withheld amount to the IRS. That payment, if made, will be
	treated as a distribution of cash to the common unitholder with
	respect to whom the payment was made and will reduce the amount
	of cash to which such common unitholder would otherwise be
	entitled.


	 





	Withholding
	and Backup Withholding





	 


	For each calendar year, we will report to you and the IRS the
	amount of distributions we made to you and the amount of
	U.S. federal income tax (if any) that we withheld on those
	distributions. The proper application to us of rules for
	withholding under Section 1441 of the Internal Revenue Code
	(applicable to certain dividends, interest and similar items) is
	unclear. Because the documentation we receive may not properly
	reflect the identities of partners at any particular time (in
	light of possible sales of common units), we may over-withhold
	or under-withhold with respect to a particular holder of common
	units. For example, we may impose withholding, remit that amount
	to the IRS and thus reduce the amount of a distribution paid to
	a

	non-U.S. Holder.

	It may





	302








	 






	 



	turn out, however, the corresponding amount of our income was
	not properly allocable to such holder, and the withholding
	should have been less than the actual withholding. Such holder
	would be entitled to a credit against the holders
	U.S. tax liability for all withholding, including any such
	excess withholding, but if the withholding exceeded the
	holders U.S. tax liability, the holder would have to
	apply for a refund to obtain the benefit of the excess
	withholding. Similarly, we may fail to withhold on a
	distribution, and it may turn out the corresponding income was
	properly allocable to a

	non-U.S. Holder

	and withholding should have been imposed. In that event, we
	intend to pay the under-withheld amount to the IRS, and we may
	treat such under-withholding as an expense that will be borne by
	all partners on a pro rata basis (since we may be unable to
	allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the relevant

	non-U.S. Holder).



	 


	Under the backup withholding rules, you may be subject to backup
	withholding tax (at the applicable rate, currently 28%) with
	respect to distributions paid unless: (1) you are a
	corporation or come within another exempt category and
	demonstrate this fact when required or (2) you provide a
	taxpayer identification number, certify as to no loss of
	exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise comply with
	the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules.
	If you are an exempt holder, you should indicate your exempt
	status on a properly completed IRS

	Form W-9.

	A

	non-U.S. Holder

	may qualify as an exempt recipient by submitting a properly
	completed IRS

	Form W-8BEN.

	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any
	backup withholding from a payment to you will be allowed as a
	credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability and
	may entitle you to a refund.


	 


	If you do not timely provide us (or the clearing agent or other
	intermediary, as appropriate) with IRS

	Form W-8

	or

	W-9,

	as
	applicable, or such form is not properly completed, we may
	become subject to U.S. backup withholding taxes in excess
	of what would have been imposed had we received certifications
	from all investors. Such excess U.S. backup withholding
	taxes may be treated by us as an expense that will be borne by
	all investors on a pro rata basis (since we may be unable to
	allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the holders
	that failed to timely provide the proper U.S. tax
	certifications).


	 





	Additional
	Withholding Requirements





	 


	Under recently enacted legislation, as well as preliminary
	guidance in the form of proposed regulations and other
	administrative guidance, the relevant withholding agent may be
	required to withhold 30% of any interest, dividends and other
	fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits and
	income from sources within the United States paid after
	December 31, 2013 or gross proceeds from the sale of any
	property of a type which can produce interest or dividends from
	sources within the United States paid after December 31,
	2014 to (i) a foreign financial institution (for which
	purposes includes foreign broker-dealers, clearing
	organizations, investment companies, hedge funds and certain
	other investment entities) unless such foreign financial
	institution agrees to verify, report and disclose its
	U.S. accountholders and meets certain other specified
	requirements or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity that is
	a beneficial owner of the payment unless such entity certifies
	that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or
	provides the name, address and taxpayer identification number of
	each substantial U.S. owner and such entity meets certain
	other specified requirements or otherwise qualifies for an
	exemption from this withholding. Non U.S. and
	U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax
	advisors regarding the possible implications of this proposed
	legislation on their investment in our common units.


	 





	Nominee
	Reporting





	 


	Persons who hold an interest in our partnership as a nominee for
	another person are required to furnish to us:


	 


	(a) the name, address and taxpayer identification number of
	the beneficial owner and the nominee;




	303








	 






	 



	(b) whether the beneficial owner is (1) a person that
	is not a U.S. person, (2) a foreign government, an
	international organization or any wholly-owned agency or
	instrumentality of either of the foregoing, or (3) a
	tax-exempt entity;


	 


	(c) the amount and description of common units held,
	acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner; and


	 


	(d) specific information including the dates of
	acquisitions and transfers, means of acquisitions and transfers
	and acquisition cost for purchases, as well as the amount of net
	proceeds from sales.


	 


	Brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish
	additional information, including whether they are
	U.S. persons and specific information on common units they
	acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of
	$50 per failure, up to a maximum of $100,000 per calendar year,
	is imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for failure to report
	that information to us. The nominee is required to supply the
	beneficial owner of the common units with the information
	furnished to us.


	 





	New
	Legislation or Administrative or Judicial Action





	 


	The U.S. federal income tax treatment of common unitholders
	depends in some instances on determinations of fact and
	interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal
	income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be
	available.


	 


	The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are
	constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative
	process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department,
	frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established
	concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other
	modifications and interpretations. No assurance can be given as
	to whether, or in what form, any proposals affecting us or our
	common unitholders will be enacted. The IRS pays close attention
	to the proper application of tax laws to partnerships. The
	present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment
	in our common units may be modified by administrative,
	legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, and any such
	action may affect investments and commitments previously made.
	Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and
	interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or
	impossible to meet the Qualifying Income Exception for us to be
	treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes affect or cause us to
	change our investments and commitments, affect the tax
	considerations of an investment in us, change the character or
	treatment of portions of our income (including, for instance,
	the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income rather than
	capital gain) and adversely affect an investment in our common
	units. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to
	U.S. Taxation  Our structure involves complex
	provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no
	clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure
	also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or
	administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on
	a retroactive basis and Risk Factors 
	Risks Related to Our Company Although not enacted,
	the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would
	have: (i) in some cases after a ten-year transition period,
	precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest
	through taxable subsidiary corporations; and (ii) taxed
	certain income and gains at increased rates. If any similar
	legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the after tax
	income and gain related to our business, as well as our
	distributions to you and the market price of our common units,
	could be reduced. In addition, statutory changes,
	revisions to regulations and other modifications and
	interpretations with respect to the tax laws of the states and
	other jurisdictions in which we operate could result in us or
	our common unitholders having to pay additional taxes. Our
	organizational documents and agreements permit the board of
	directors to modify the amended and restated operating agreement
	from time to time, without the consent of the common
	unitholders, in order to address certain changes in
	U.S. federal and state income tax regulations, legislation
	or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could
	have a material adverse impact on some or all of our common
	unitholders.

	THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR
	CAREFUL TAX PLANNING. THE TAX MATTERS RELATING TO CARLYLE AND
	ITS UNITHOLDERS ARE COMPLEX AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING
	INTERPRETATIONS. MOREOVER, THE MEANING AND IMPACT OF TAX LAWS
	AND OF PROPOSED CHANGES WILL VARY WITH THE PARTICULAR
	CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PROSPECTIVE UNITHOLDER. PROSPECTIVE
	UNITHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO
	THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ANY
	INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON UNITS.





	305








	 






	 




	 




	CERTAIN
	ERISA CONSIDERATIONS





	 


	The following is a summary of certain considerations associated
	with the purchase of our common units by (i) employee
	benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the
	U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
	amended (ERISA), (ii) plans that are subject to
	Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
	1986, as amended (the Code) and (iii) entities
	whose underlying assets are considered to include plan
	assets of such employee benefit plans and plans (each of
	the foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii) and
	(ii) being referred to as an ERISA Plan).


	 


	In considering whether to invest the assets of any ERISA Plan in
	the common units, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should determine,
	among other things, whether the investment is in accordance with
	the documents and instruments governing such plan and the
	applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any provisions of
	Similar Law (as defined below) relating to a fiduciarys
	duties to such ERISA Plan, including, without limitation, the
	prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited
	transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law.


	 




	Prohibited
	Transaction Issues




	 


	ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans
	from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets
	with persons or entities who are parties in
	interest, within the meaning of ERISA, or
	disqualified persons, within the meaning of
	Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
	A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a
	non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
	and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In
	addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a
	non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties
	and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.


	 


	Whether or not our underlying assets were deemed to include
	plan assets, as described below, the acquisition of
	our common units by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we are
	considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may
	constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
	transaction under Section 406 of ERISA

	and/or

	Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired
	and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or
	individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the
	U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL) has issued
	prohibited transaction class exemptions, or PTCEs,
	that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the common
	units or any interest therein. These class exemptions include,
	without limitation,

	PTCE 84-14

	respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
	professional asset managers,

	PTCE 90-1

	respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts,

	PTCE 91-38

	respecting bank collective investment funds,

	PTCE 95-60

	respecting life insurance company general accounts and

	PTCE 96-23

	respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers,
	although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of
	any such exemptions will be satisfied.


	 




	Plan
	Asset Issues




	 


	ERISA and the regulations (the Plan Asset
	Regulations) promulgated under ERISA by the DOL generally
	provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in
	an entity that is neither a publicly-offered
	security nor a security issued by an investment company
	registered under the 1940 Act, the ERISA Plans assets
	include both the equity interests and an undivided interest in
	each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is
	established either that less than 25% of the total value of each
	class of equity interests in the entity is held by benefit
	plan investors as defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA
	(the 25% Test) or that the entity is an
	operating company, as defined in the Plan Asset
	Regulations. There can be no assurance that we will satisfy the
	25% Test and it is not anticipated that we will qualify as an
	operating company or register as an investment company under the
	1940 Act. It is anticipated that the common units offered
	hereunder will qualify for the exemption for a
	publicly-offered security, although no assurances
	can be given in this regard.




	306








	 






	 



	For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations, a publicly
	offered security is a security that is
	(a) freely transferable, (b) part of a
	class of securities that is widely held, and (c)
	(i) sold to the ERISA Plan as part of an offering of
	securities to the public pursuant to an effective registration
	statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and the class of
	securities to which such security is a part is registered under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within 120 days after
	the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the
	offering of such securities to the public has occurred, or
	(ii) is part of a class of securities that is registered
	under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. We intend to effect
	such a registration under the Securities Act and Securities
	Exchange Act. The Plan Asset Regulations provide that a security
	is widely held only if it is part of a class of
	securities that is owned by 100 or more investors independent of
	the issuer and one another. A security will not fail to be
	widely held because the number of independent
	investors falls below 100 subsequent to the initial offering
	thereof as a result of events beyond the control of the issuer.
	The Plan Asset Regulations provide that whether a security is
	freely transferable is a factual question to be
	determined on the basis of all the relevant facts and
	circumstances. It is anticipated that our common units to be
	sold in this offering will be widely held and
	freely transferable, although no assurances can be
	given in this regard.


	 


	If our assets were deemed to be plan assets under
	ERISA, this would result, among other things, in (i) the
	application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility
	standards of ERISA to investments made by us, and (ii) the
	possibility that certain transactions in which we might seek to
	engage could constitute prohibited transactions
	under ERISA.


	 


	Governmental plans, certain church plans and

	non-United

	States plans (such plans together with ERISA Plans referred to
	herein as Plans), while not subject to the fiduciary
	responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of
	Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may
	nevertheless be subject to other federal, state, local,

	non-U.S. or

	other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the
	foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively referred
	to herein as Similar Laws).


	 




	Representation




	 


	Because of the foregoing, the common units should not be
	purchased or held by any person investing plan
	assets of any Plan unless the purchase and holding will
	not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
	Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
	similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Accordingly,
	by its acquisition of common units or any interest therein each
	purchaser will be deemed to have represented and warranted that
	either (i) no portion of the assets used to purchase or
	hold the common units or any interest therein constitutes the
	assets of any Plan, or (ii) the purchase and holding of the
	common units and any interest therein will not result in a
	non-exempt prohibited transaction under Title I of ERISA or
	Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of any
	applicable Similar Laws.


	 



	Each Plan fiduciary or other persons considering purchasing
	our common units on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan
	should consult with its legal advisor concerning the matters
	described herein.

	The underwriters are offering the common units subject to their
	acceptance of the common units from us and subject to prior
	sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations
	of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of
	the common units offered by this prospectus are subject to the
	approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to
	certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take
	and pay for all of the common units offered by this prospectus
	if any such common units are taken. However, the underwriters
	are not required to take or pay for the common units covered by
	the underwriters over-allotment option described below.


	 


	The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the common
	units directly to the public at the public offering price listed
	on the cover page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers
	at a price that represents a concession not in excess of $0.594
	a unit under the public offering price. After the initial
	offering of the common units, the offering price and other
	selling terms may from time to time be varied by the
	representatives. The offering of the common units by the
	underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to
	the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in
	part.


	 


	We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for
	30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to
	an aggregate of 4,575,000 additional common units at the public
	offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less
	underwriting discounts. The underwriters may exercise this
	option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if
	any, made in connection with the offering of the common units
	offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is
	exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to
	specified conditions, to purchase approximately the same
	percentage of common units as the number listed next to the





	308








	 






	 



	underwriters name in the preceding table bears to the
	total number of common units listed next to the names of all
	underwriters in the preceding table. If the underwriters
	option is exercised in full, the total price to the public would
	be $771,650,000, the total underwriters discounts would be
	$36,653,375 and the total proceeds to us would be $734,996,625.


	 


	The underwriters have informed us that they do not expect sales
	to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total
	number of common units offered.


	 


	We have agreed that we will not (i) offer, pledge, announce
	the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option
	or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to
	sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or
	otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement
	(other than any registration statement on

	Form S-8

	to register common units issued or available for future grant
	under The Carlyle Group L.P. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan) under
	the Securities Act relating to, any of our common units or
	securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
	our common units, or publicly disclose the intention to make any
	offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, or (ii) enter
	into any swap or other arrangement that transfers all or a
	portion of the economic consequences associated with the
	ownership of any of our common units or any such other
	securities (regardless of whether any of these transactions are
	to be settled by the delivery of common units or such other
	securities, in cash or otherwise), in each case without the
	prior written consent of the representatives for a period of
	180 days after the date of this prospectus. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, if (1) during the last 17 days of the

	180-day

	restricted period, we issue an earnings release or material news
	or a material event relating to Carlyle occurs; or
	(2) prior to the expiration of the

	180-day

	restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings
	results during the

	16-day

	period beginning on the last day of the

	180-day

	period, the restrictions described above shall continue to apply
	until the expiration of the

	18-day

	period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the
	occurrence of the material news or material event. These
	restrictions do not apply to certain sales, issuances,
	distributions and transfers. See Common Units Eligible for
	Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements.


	 


	The directors and officers of our general partner as well as
	Mubadala and CalPERS have entered into lock up agreements with
	the underwriters prior to the commencement of this offering
	pursuant to which each of these persons or entities, with
	limited exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date
	of this prospectus, may not, without the prior written consent
	of the representatives, (1) offer, pledge, announce the
	intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
	contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell,
	grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise
	transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of our
	common units or any securities convertible into or exercisable
	or exchangeable for our common units (including, without
	limitation, common units or such other securities which may be
	deemed to be beneficially owned by such directors, executive
	officers, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of
	the SEC and securities which may be issued upon exercise of an
	option or warrant) or (2) enter into any swap or other
	agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the
	economic consequences of ownership of the common units or such
	other securities, whether any such transaction described in
	clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery
	of common units or such other securities, in cash or otherwise,
	or (3) make any demand for or exercise any right with
	respect to the registration of any of our common units or any
	security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our
	common units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) during
	the last 17 days of the

	180-day

	restricted period, we issue an earnings release or material news
	or a material event relating to Carlyle occurs; or
	(2) prior to the expiration of the

	180-day

	restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings
	results during the

	16-day

	period beginning on the last day of the

	180-day

	period, the restrictions described above shall continue to apply
	until the expiration of the

	18-day

	period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the
	occurrence of the material news or material event. These
	restrictions do not apply to certain sales, issuances,
	distributions and transfers. See Common Units Eligible for
	Future Sale 

	Lock-Up

	Arrangements.


	 


	The representatives in their sole discretion may release any of
	the securities subject to these

	lock-up

	agreements at any time without notice. The
	representatives have no present intent or





	309








	 






	 



	arrangement to release any of the securities subject to these

	lock-up

	agreements. The release of any

	lock-up

	is
	considered on a

	case-by-case

	basis. Factors in deciding whether to release common units may
	include the length of time before the

	lock-up

	expires, the number of common units involved, the reason for the
	requested release, market conditions, the trading price of our
	common units, historical trading volumes of our common units and
	whether the person seeking the release is an officer, director
	or affiliate of us. If the representatives, in their sole
	discretion, agree to release or waive the restrictions set forth
	in a

	lock-up

	agreement for an officer or director of our general partner and
	provide us with notice of the impending release or waiver at
	least three business days before the effective date of the
	release or waiver, we have agreed to announce the impending
	release or waiver by a press release through a major news
	service at least two business days before the effective date of
	the release or waiver.


	 


	The following table shows the per common unit and total
	underwriting discounts payable by us. The amounts are shown
	assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the
	underwriters option to purchase up to an additional
	4,575,000 common units.

	In addition, we estimate that the expenses of this offering
	payable by us, other than underwriting discounts, will be
	approximately $19.2 million. The underwriters have agreed
	to reimburse us for a portion of certain expenses incurred in
	connection with this offering.


	 


	In order to facilitate the offering of the common units, the
	underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain
	or otherwise affect the price of the common units. The
	underwriters may sell more common units than they are obligated
	to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short
	position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no
	greater than the number of common units available for purchase
	by the underwriters under their over-allotment option. The
	underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising
	their

	over-allotment

	option or purchasing common units in the open market. In
	determining the source of common units to close out a covered
	short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things,
	the open market price of common units compared to the price
	available under their over-allotment option. The underwriters
	may also sell common units in excess of their over-allotment
	option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must
	close out any naked short position by purchasing common units in
	the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be
	created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be
	downward pressure on the price of the common units in the open
	market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who
	purchase in the offering. In addition, to stabilize the price of
	the common units, the underwriters may bid for and purchase
	common units in the open market. Finally, the underwriting
	syndicate may reclaim selling concessions allowed to an
	underwriter or a dealer for distributing the common units in the
	offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed
	common units to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize
	the price of the common units. These activities may raise or
	maintain the market price of the common units above independent
	market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price
	of the common units. The underwriters may conduct these
	transactions on NASDAQ Global Select Market or in the

	over-the-counter

	market, or otherwise. The underwriters are not required to
	engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities
	at any time.


	 


	Our common units have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ
	Global Select Market under the symbol CG.


	 


	The underwriters

	and/or

	their
	respective affiliates are full service financial institutions
	engaged in various activities, which may include securities
	trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
	investment management, investment research, principal
	investment, hedging, financial and brokerage activities. In the
	ordinary course of their various business activities, the
	underwriters and/or their respective affiliates and/or their
	respective senior employees own, and may in the future





	310








	 






	 



	acquire, limited partnership interests in some of the investment
	funds we manage, and have participated, or in the future may
	participate, in co-investments with our investment funds in
	portfolio companies of these investment funds. The underwriters

	and/or

	their
	respective affiliates may also make or hold a broad array of
	investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
	related derivative securities) and financial instruments
	(including bank loans) for their own account and for the
	accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities
	activities may involve our securities

	and/or

	instruments. Certain of the underwriters

	and/or

	their
	respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and
	may in the future perform, various investment banking, financial
	advisory and lending services for us, the investment funds we
	manage and our funds portfolio companies, for which they
	have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In
	addition, the underwriters and/or their respective affiliates
	may, from time to time, engage in other transactions with and
	perform services for us, the investment funds we manage and our
	funds portfolio companies, in the ordinary course of their
	business for which they will receive customary fees. The
	underwriters

	and/or

	their
	respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations

	and/or

	publish or express independent research views in respect of such
	securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend
	to clients that they acquire, long

	and/or

	short
	positions in such securities and instruments.


	 


	Because FINRA views the common units offered by this prospectus
	as interests in a direct participation program, this offering is
	being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 2310
	(Rule 2310). Accordingly, the total amount of
	underwriting compensation paid to the underwriters in connection
	with this offering will not exceed ten percent of the gross
	proceeds of this offering. In addition, an investment fund that
	we manage has a minority investment in Sandler
	ONeill & Partners, L.P., an underwriter in this
	offering. Accordingly, Sandler ONeill &
	Partners, L.P. may be deemed to be our affiliate within the
	meaning of Rule 2310. In accordance with Rule 2310,
	the underwriters in this offering will not confirm sales of the
	common units to any account over which they exercise
	discretionary authority without the prior written approval of
	the customer.

	Pricing
	of the Offering




	 


	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our
	common units. The initial public offering price was determined
	by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the
	factors considered in determining the initial public offering
	price were:


	 












	 


	 


	our future prospects and those of our industry in general;




	 




	 


	 


	our revenues, earnings and other financial operating information
	in recent periods;




	 




	 


	 


	the general condition of the securities markets at the time of
	this offering;




	 




	 


	 


	an assessment of our management;




	 




	 


	 


	the price-earnings ratios, price revenues ratios, market prices
	of securities and financial and operating information of
	companies engaged in activities similar to ours; and




	 




	 


	 


	other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us.




	 


	Neither we nor the underwriters can assure investors that an
	active trading market will develop for our common units, or that
	the common units will trade in the public market at or above the
	initial public offering price.


	 




	Selling
	Restrictions

	or the underwriters that would permit a public offering of the
	common units offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction
	where action for that purpose is required. The common units
	offered by this prospectus may not be offered or sold, directly
	or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or any other offering
	material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale
	of any such common units be distributed or published in any
	jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in
	compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that
	jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus
	comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
	restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of

	The Partners of The Carlyle Group L.P.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of The Carlyle
	Group L.P. (the Partnership), as of
	December 31, 2011. This balance sheet is the responsibility
	of the Partnerships management. Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on this balance sheet based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
	reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheet is free of
	material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit
	of the Partnerships internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
	over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
	procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
	for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Partnerships internal control over financial
	reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
	also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheet, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, and evaluating the overall balance sheet
	presentation. We believe that our audit of the balance sheet
	provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the balance sheet referred to above presents
	fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
	Carlyle Group L.P. at December 31, 2011, in conformity with
	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	ORGANIZATION







	 


	The Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership) was formed
	as a Delaware limited partnership on July 18, 2011.
	Pursuant to a reorganization into a holding partnership
	structure, the Partnership will become a holding partnership and
	its sole assets are expected to be an equity interest through
	wholly-owned subsidiary entities in Carlyle Holdings I L.P.,
	Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P.
	(collectively, Carlyle Holdings). Through
	wholly-owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership will be the
	sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and will operate and
	control all of the businesses and affairs of Carlyle Holdings
	and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continue to
	conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries.
	Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the
	Partnership.

	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America. Separate Statements of
	Operations, Changes in Equity and of Cash Flows have not been
	presented in the financial statement because there have been no
	activities of this entity.

	Report of
	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





	 


	The Members of Carlyle Group


	 


	We have audited the accompanying combined and consolidated
	balance sheets of Carlyle Group, as described in Note 1,
	(the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
	and the related combined and consolidated statements of
	operations, changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling
	interests in consolidated entities, and cash flows for each of
	the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
	opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
	reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
	audit of the Companys internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
	over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
	procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
	for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
	present fairly, in all material respects, the combined and
	consolidated financial position of Carlyle Group, as described
	in Note 1, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the
	combined and consolidated results of its operations and its cash
	flows for each of the three years in the period ended
	December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally
	accepted accounting principles.


	 


	As discussed in Note 2 to the combined and consolidated
	financial statements, on January 1, 2010, the Company
	adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board related to variable interest entities.

	Carlyle
	Group





	Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements





	 












	1.  






	Organization
	and Basis of Presentation







	 


	The Carlyle Group (Carlyle) is one of the
	worlds largest global alternative asset management firms
	that originates, structures and acts as lead equity investor in
	management-led buyouts, strategic minority equity investments,
	equity private placements, consolidations and buildups, growth
	capital financings, real estate opportunities, bank loans,
	high-yield debt, distressed assets, mezzanine debt and other
	investment opportunities.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements combine the accounts of
	four affiliated entities: TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman
	L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman
	Investment Holdings, L.P., as well as their majority-owned
	subsidiaries (collectively the Company or
	Carlyle Group), which are under common ownership and
	control by Carlyles individual partners, CalPERS, and
	Mubadala Development Company (Mubadala). In
	addition, certain Carlyle-affiliated funds, related
	co-investment entities, and certain collateralized loan
	obligations (CLOs) managed by the Company
	(collectively the Consolidated Funds) have been
	consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for
	certain of the periods presented pursuant to U.S. generally
	accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) as
	described in Note 2. This consolidation generally has a

	gross-up

	effect on assets, liabilities and cash flows, and has no effect
	on the net income attributable to Carlyle Group or members
	equity. The majority economic ownership interests of the
	investors in the Consolidated Funds are reflected as
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, equity
	appropriated for consolidated entities, and redeemable
	non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the
	accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements. As
	further described in Note 2, the CLOs are consolidated as
	of January 1, 2010 or the acquisition date for CLOs
	subsequently acquired (see Note 3 and
	Note 15) and, accordingly, the accompanying combined
	and consolidated financial statements do not consolidate the
	same entities in each year and are, in that regard, not
	comparable.


	 


	The Company provides investment management services to, and has
	transactions with, various private equity funds, real estate
	funds, CLOs, hedge funds and other investment products sponsored
	by the Company for the investment of client assets in the normal
	course of business. The Company serves as the general partner,
	investment manager or collateral manager, making

	day-to-day

	investment decisions concerning the assets of these products.
	The Company operates its business through four reportable
	segments: Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Market
	Strategies and Fund of Funds Solutions (see Note 14).


	 


	Net income is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for
	partnerships and is not comparable to net income of a
	corporation. All distributions and compensation for services
	rendered by Carlyles individual partners have been
	reflected as distributions from equity rather than compensation
	expense in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial
	statements.


	 





	Significant
	Transactions (see Notes 3 and 9)





	 


	On July 1, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of a
	60% equity interest in AlpInvest Partners N.V.
	(AlpInvest), one of the worlds largest
	investors in private equity which advises a global private
	equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and
	secondary activities.


	 


	On July 1, 2011 the Company acquired 55% of Emerging
	Sovereign Group LLC, its subsidiaries, and Emerging Sovereign
	Partners LLC (collectively, ESG), an emerging
	markets equities and macroeconomic strategies investment manager.


	 


	In August 2011, the Company purchased a management contract
	relating to a CLO previously managed by The Foothill Group, Inc
	(Foothill).

	On September 30, 2011, the Company amended and extended its
	Senior Secured Credit Facility to increase the revolving credit
	facility to $750.0 million.


	 


	On October 20, 2011, the Company redeemed
	$250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
	subordinated notes for a redemption price of
	$260.0 million, plus accrued interest of approximately
	$5.5 million.


	 


	On November 18, 2011, the Company acquired Churchill
	Financial LLC (Churchill) and its primary asset, the
	CLO management contract of Churchill Financial Cayman Ltd.



	 












	2.  






	Summary
	of Significant Accounting Policies







	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 


	In addition to the four affiliated entities described in
	Note 1, the accompanying combined and consolidated
	financial statements consolidate: 1) Carlyle-affiliated
	funds and co-investment entities, for which the Company is the
	sole general partner and the presumption of control by the
	general partner has not been overcome and 2) variable
	interest entities (VIEs), including certain CLOs, for which the
	Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary; consolidation
	of these entities is a requirement under U.S. GAAP. All
	significant inter-entity transactions and balances have been
	eliminated.


	 


	For entities that are determined to be VIEs, the Company
	consolidates those entities where it is deemed to be the primary
	beneficiary. Pursuant to revised consolidation rules that became
	effective January 1, 2010, an entity is determined to be
	the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial
	interest. A controlling financial interest is defined as
	(a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
	significantly impact the entitys business and (b) the
	obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
	receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
	significant to the VIE. The revised consolidation rules require
	an analysis to (a) determine whether an entity in which the
	Company holds a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether
	the Companys involvement, through holding interests
	directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through
	other variable interests (e.g., management and performance
	related fees), would give it a controlling financial interest.
	In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary,
	the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held
	either directly or indirectly by the Company. The consolidation
	analysis is generally performed qualitatively. This analysis,
	which requires judgment, is performed at each reporting date.


	 


	In February 2010, Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

	No. 2010-10,

	Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, was issued.
	This ASU defers the application of the revised consolidation
	rules for a reporting enterprises interest in an entity if
	certain conditions are met, including if the entity has the
	attributes of an investment company and is not a securitization
	or asset-backed financing entity. An entity that qualifies for
	the deferral will continue to be assessed for consolidation
	under the overall guidance on VIEs, before its amendment, and
	other applicable consolidation guidance.


	 


	Beginning January 1, 2010, the Company was required to
	consolidate 16 CLOs, which are investment vehicles created for
	the sole purpose of issuing collateralized loan instruments.
	Upon consolidation, the Company elected the fair value option
	for eligible liabilities to mitigate accounting mismatches
	between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities. Upon
	adoption of the provisions of the revised consolidation
	guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to
	equity appropriated for consolidated funds of $0.7 billion.
	Also, during 2010 we acquired certain CLO management contracts
	that resulted in an additional $0.5 billion of equity
	appropriated for consolidated funds. Refer to Note 3 for
	additional disclosures related to these acquistions.

	Carlyle
	Group





	 




	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 



	As of December 31, 2011, assets and liabilities of
	consolidated VIEs reflected in the combined and consolidated
	balance sheets were $18.4 billion and $10.2 billion,
	respectively. Other than the assets of the VIEs which are
	consolidated, the holders of the consolidated VIEs
	liabilities do not have recourse to the Company. The assets and
	liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are comprised primarily of
	investments and loans payable, respectively.


	 


	The loans payable issued by the CLOs are backed by diversified
	collateral asset portfolios consisting primarily of loans or
	structured debt. In exchange for managing the collateral for the
	CLOs, the Company earns investment management fees, including in
	some cases subordinated management fees and contingent incentive
	fees. In cases where the Company consolidates the CLOs, those
	management fees have been eliminated as intercompany
	transactions. At December 31, 2011, the Company held
	$58.0 million of investments in these CLOs which represents
	its maximum risk of loss. The Companys investments in
	these CLOs are generally subordinated to other interests in the
	entities and entitle the Company to receive a pro rata portion
	of the residual cash flows, if any, from the entities. Investors
	in the CLOs have no recourse against the Company for any losses
	sustained in the CLO structure.


	 


	For all Carlyle-affiliated funds and co-investment entities
	(collectively the Funds) that are not determined to
	be VIEs, the Company consolidates those funds where, as the sole
	general partner, it has not overcome the presumption of control
	pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Most Carlyle funds provide a
	dissolution right upon a simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle
	affiliated limited partners such that the presumption of control
	by Carlyle is overcome. Accordingly, these funds are not
	consolidated in the Companys combined and consolidated
	financial statements.


	 





	Investments
	in Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities





	 


	The Company holds variable interests in certain VIEs which are
	not consolidated because the Company is not the primary
	beneficiary. The Companys involvement with such entities
	is in the form of direct equity interests and fee arrangements.
	The maximum exposure to loss represents the loss of assets
	recognized by the Company relating to these unconsolidated
	entities. The assets recognized in the Companys combined
	and consolidated balance sheets related to the Companys
	interests in these non-consolidated VIEs and the Companys
	maximum exposure to loss relating to non-consolidated VIEs were
	as follows:

	Basis
	of Accounting





	 


	The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance
	with U.S. GAAP. Management has determined that the
	Companys Funds are investment companies under
	U.S. GAAP for the purposes of financial reporting.
	U.S. GAAP for an investment company requires investments to
	be recorded at estimated fair value and the unrealized gains

	and/or

	losses in an investments fair value are recognized on a
	current basis in the statements of operations. Additionally, the
	Funds do not consolidate their majority-owned and controlled
	investments (the

	Portfolio Companies). In the preparation of these combined and
	consolidated financial statements, the Company has retained the
	specialized accounting for the Funds, pursuant to U.S. GAAP.


	 


	All of the investments held and notes issued by the Consolidated
	Funds are presented at their estimated fair values in the
	Companys combined and consolidated balance sheets.
	Interest income and other income of the Consolidated Funds is
	included in interest and other income of Consolidated Funds and
	interest expense and other expenses of the Consolidated Funds is
	included in interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds in
	the Companys combined and consolidated statements of
	operations. The excess of the CLO assets over the CLO
	liabilities upon consolidation is reflected in the
	Companys combined and consolidated balance sheets as
	equity appropriated for Consolidated Funds. Net income
	attributable to the investors in the CLOs is included in net
	income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities in the combined and consolidated
	statements of operations and equity appropriated for
	Consolidated Funds in the combined and consolidated balance
	sheets.


	 





	Use of
	Estimates





	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	U.S. GAAP requires management to make assumptions and
	estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
	Managements estimates are based on historical experiences
	and other factors, including expectations of future events that
	management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It
	also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of
	applying the Companys accounting policies. Assumptions and
	estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their
	resulting impact on performance fees involve a higher degree of
	judgment and complexity and these assumptions and estimates may
	be significant to the combined and consolidated financial
	statements and the resulting impact on performance fees. Actual
	results could differ from these estimates and such differences
	could be material.


	 





	Business
	Combinations





	 


	The Company accounts for business combinations using the
	acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price
	of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and
	liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by
	management as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration
	obligations that are elements of consideration transferred are
	recognized as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value
	transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
	Acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with a business
	combination are expensed.

	Fund Management
	Fees




	 


	The Company provides management services to funds in which it
	holds a general partner interest or has a management agreement.
	For corporate private equity, real assets and certain global
	market strategies funds, management fees are calculated based on
	(a) limited partners capital commitments to the
	funds, (b) limited partners remaining capital
	invested in the funds at cost or (c) the net asset value
	(NAV) of certain of the funds, less offsets for the
	non-affiliated limited partners share of transaction
	advisory and portfolio fees earned, as defined in the respective
	partnership agreements.


	 


	Management fees for corporate private equity, real assets funds
	and closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies
	segment generally range from 1% to 2% of commitments during the





	F-13








	 








	Carlyle
	Group





	 




	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 



	investment period of the relevant fund. Following the expiration
	or termination of the investment period of such funds, the
	management fees generally step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% of
	contributions for unrealized investments. The Company will
	receive management fees for corporate private equity and real
	assets funds during a specified period of time, which is
	generally ten years from the initial closing date, or in some
	instances, from the final closing date, but such termination
	date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances or later if
	extended for successive one-year periods, typically up to a
	maximum of two years. Depending upon the contracted terms of
	investment advisory or investment management and related
	agreements, these fees are called semi-annually in advance and
	are recognized as earned over the subsequent six month period.


	 


	For certain global market strategies funds, management fees are
	calculated based on assets under management of the funds with
	generally lower fee rates. Hedge funds generally pay management
	fees quarterly that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of NAV per year.
	Management fees for the CLOs typically range from 0.4% to 0.5%
	on the total par amount of assets in the fund and are due
	quarterly or semi-annually based on the terms and recognized
	over the respective period. Management fees for the CLOs and
	credit opportunities funds are governed by indentures and
	collateral management agreements. The Company will receive
	management fees for the CLOs until redemption of the securities
	issued by the CLOs, which is generally five to ten years after
	issuance. Open-ended funds typically do not have stated
	termination dates.


	 


	Management fees from fund of funds vehicles generally range from
	0.3% to 1.0% on the vehicles capital commitments during
	the first two to five years of the investment period and 0.3% to
	1.0% on the lower of cost of capital invested or fair value of
	the capital invested thereafter.


	 


	The Company also provides transaction advisory and portfolio
	advisory services to the Portfolio Companies, and where covered
	by separate contractual agreements, recognizes fees for these
	services when the service has been provided and collection is
	reasonably assured. Fund management fees includes transaction
	and portfolio advisory fees of $75.7 million,
	$50.0 million and $32.9 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net of any
	offsets as defined in the respective partnership agreements.


	 




	Performance
	Fees




	 


	Performance fees consist principally of the allocation of
	profits from certain of the funds to which the Company is
	entitled (commonly known as carried interest). The Company is
	generally entitled to a 20% allocation (or approximately 2% to
	10% in the case of most of the Companys fund of funds
	vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried
	interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of
	preferred returns and return of certain fund costs (subject to

	catch-up

	provisions) from its corporate private equity and real assets
	funds. Carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the
	funds investment values above certain return hurdles set
	forth in each respective partnership agreement. The Company
	recognizes revenues attributable to performance fees based upon
	the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership
	agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at
	that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized as unrealized
	performance fees reflects the Companys share of the gains
	and losses of the associated funds underlying investments
	measured at their then-current fair values.


	 


	Carried interest is ultimately realized when: (i) an
	underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) the
	funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred
	return and (iii) the Company has decided to collect carry
	rather than return additional capital to limited partner
	investors. Realized carried interests may be required to be
	returned by the Company in future periods if the funds
	investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair
	value of a funds investments falls below certain return
	hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In
	all cases, each





	F-14








	 








	Carlyle

	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 



	fund is considered separately in this regard, and for a given
	fund, performance fees can never be negative over the life of a
	fund. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a funds
	investments at their then current fair values, previously
	recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to
	be returned, a liability is established for the potential
	giveback obligation. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
	Company has recognized $136.5 million and
	$119.6 million, respectively, for giveback obligations.


	 


	In addition to its performance fees from its corporate private
	equity and real assets funds, the Company is also entitled to
	receive performance fees from certain of its global market
	strategies funds and fund of funds vehicles when the return on
	assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or
	other performance targets. In such arrangements, performance
	fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been
	achieved, and are included in performance fees in the
	accompanying combined and consolidated statements of operations.


	 




	Investment
	Income (Loss)




	 


	Investment income (loss) represents the unrealized and realized
	gains and losses resulting from the Companys equity method
	investments and other principal investments. Investment income
	(loss) is realized when the Company redeems all or a portion of
	its investment or when the Company receives cash income, such as
	dividends or distributions. Unrealized investment income (loss)
	results from changes in the fair value of the underlying
	investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gain (loss) at
	the time an investment is realized.


	 




	Interest
	Income




	 


	Interest income is recognized when earned. Interest income
	earned by the Company was $8.4 million, $12.8 million
	and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31,
	2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and is included in interest
	and other income in the accompanying combined and consolidated
	statements of operations. Interest income of the Consolidated
	Funds was $605.7 million, $435.5 million and
	$0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011,
	2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in interest and
	other income of Consolidated Funds in the accompanying combined
	and consolidated statements of operations.


	 





	Compensation
	and Benefits  Base Compensation





	 


	Compensation includes salaries, bonuses (discretionary awards
	and guaranteed amounts) and performance payment arrangements.
	Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they
	relate. All payments made to Carlyle partners are accounted for
	as distributions from equity rather than as employee
	compensation.


	 





	Compensation
	and Benefits  Performance Fee Related





	 


	A portion of the performance fees earned is due to employees and
	advisors of the Company. These amounts are accounted for as
	compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the
	related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized
	as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits
	liability. Accordingly, upon any reversal of performance fee
	revenue, the related compensation expense is also reversed. The
	Company recorded $103.4 million, $163.8 million and
	$84.2 million of expense related to these arrangements for
	the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
	respectively. The Company had a liability of $293.2 million
	and $305.8 million in accrued compensation related to the
	portion of accrued performance fees due to employees and
	advisors as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

	Income
	Taxes





	 


	No provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes in
	the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements
	since the Company is a group of pass-through entities for
	U.S. income tax purposes and its profits and losses are
	allocated to the partners who are individually responsible for
	reporting such amounts. Based on applicable foreign, state and
	local tax laws, the Company records a provision for income taxes
	for certain entities. The Companys AlpInvest subsidiary is
	subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands. Tax
	positions taken by the Company are subject to periodic audit by
	U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.


	 


	The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
	income taxes pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Under this method,
	deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
	future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
	between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
	liabilities are measured using the statutory tax rates expected
	to be applied in the periods in which those temporary
	differences are settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on
	deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period
	of the change. A valuation allowance is recorded on the
	Companys net deferred tax assets when it is more likely
	than not that such assets will not be realized.


	 


	The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the
	U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions
	where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for
	all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this
	analysis, the Company determines that uncertainties in tax
	positions exist, a liability is established. The Company
	recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain
	tax positions in the provision for income taxes within the
	combined and consolidated statements of operations.


	 





	Non-controlling
	Interests in Consolidated Entities





	 


	Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the
	component of equity in consolidated entities held by third-party
	investors. These interests are adjusted for general partner
	allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in hedge funds
	which occur during the reporting period. Non-controlling
	interests related to hedge funds are subject to quarterly or
	monthly redemption by investors in these funds following the
	expiration of a specified period of time (typically one year),
	or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee during the
	period when capital may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in
	these types of funds have been granted redemption rights,
	amounts relating to third-party interests in such consolidated
	funds are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities within the combined and consolidated
	balance sheets. When redeemable amounts become contractually
	payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and
	included in other liabilities of Consolidated Funds in the
	combined and consolidated balance sheets.


	 





	Investments





	 


	Investments include (i) the Companys ownership
	interests (typically general partner interests) in the Funds,
	(ii) the investments held by the Consolidated Funds (all of
	which are presented at fair value in the Companys combined
	and consolidated financial statements) and (iii) certain
	credit-oriented investments. The valuation procedures utilized
	for investments of the Funds vary depending on the nature of the
	investment. The fair value of investments in publicly-traded
	securities is based on the closing price of the security with
	adjustments to reflect appropriate discounts if the securities
	are subject to restrictions. Upon the sale of a security, the
	realized net gain or loss is computed on a weighted average cost
	basis, with the exception of the CLOs, which





	F-16








	 








	Carlyle
	Group





	 




	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 



	compute the realized net gain or loss on a first in, first out
	basis. Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date
	basis.


	 


	The fair value of non-equity securities, which may include
	instruments that are not listed on an exchange, considers, among
	other factors, external pricing sources, such as dealer quotes
	or independent pricing services, recent trading activity or
	other information that, in the opinion of the Company, may not
	have been reflected in pricing obtained from external sources.


	 


	When valuing private securities or assets without readily
	determinable market prices, the Company gives consideration to
	operating results, financial condition, economic

	and/or

	market events, recent sales prices and other pertinent
	information. These valuation procedures may vary by investment
	but include such techniques as comparable public market
	valuation, comparable acquisition valuation and discounted cash
	flow analysis. Because of the inherent uncertainty, these
	estimated values may differ significantly from the values that
	would have been used had a ready market for the investments
	existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could
	be material. Furthermore, there is no assurance that, upon
	liquidation, the Company will realize the values presented
	herein.


	 





	Equity-Method
	Investments





	 


	The Company accounts for all investments in the unconsolidated
	Funds in which it has significant influence using the equity
	method of accounting. The carrying value of equity-method
	investments is determined based on amounts invested by the
	Company, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the
	Funds allocated based on the respective Fund partnership
	agreement, less distributions received. The Company evaluates
	its equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or
	changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
	such investments may not be recoverable.


	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 


	Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks and cash
	held for distributions, including temporary investments with
	original maturities of less than six months when purchased.
	Included in cash and cash equivalents is cash withheld from
	carried interest distributions for potential giveback
	obligations of $76.6 million and $51.8 million at
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.


	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents Held at Consolidated Funds





	 


	Cash and cash equivalents held at Consolidated Funds consists of
	cash and cash equivalents held by the Consolidated Funds, which,
	although not legally restricted, is not available to fund the
	general liquidity needs of the Company.


	 





	Restricted
	Cash





	 


	In addition to the unrestricted cash held for potential giveback
	obligations discussed above, the Company is required to withhold
	a certain portion of the carried interest proceeds from one of
	its corporate private equity funds to provide a reserve for
	potential giveback obligations. In connection with this
	agreement, cash and cash equivalents of $13.6 million and
	$14.9 million are included in restricted cash at
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining
	balance in restricted cash at December 31, 2011 primarily
	represents cash held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries
	due to certain government regulatory capital requirements.

	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 






	Restricted
	Cash and Securities of Consolidated Funds





	 


	Certain CLOs receive cash from various counterparties to satisfy
	collateral requirements on derivative transactions. Cash
	received to satisfy these collateral requirements of
	$31.7 million and $34.8 million is included in
	restricted cash and securities of Consolidated Funds at
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.


	 


	Certain CLOs hold U.S. Treasury notes, Obligation
	Assimilable du Tresor Securities (OATS) Strips,
	French government securities, guaranteed investment contracts
	and other highly liquid asset-backed securities as collateral
	for specific classes of loans payable in the CLOs. As of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, securities of
	$57.5 million and $100.7 million are included in
	restricted cash and securities of Consolidated Funds.


	 





	Derivative
	Instruments





	 


	Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the
	combined and consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair
	value recognized in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations for all derivatives not designated as hedging
	instruments. For all derivatives where hedge accounting is
	applied, effectiveness testing and other procedures to assess
	the ongoing validity of the hedges are performed at least
	quarterly. For instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the
	Company records changes in the estimated fair value of the
	derivative, to the extent that the hedging relationship is
	effective, in other comprehensive income (loss). If the hedging
	relationship for a derivative is determined to be ineffective,
	due to changes in the hedging instrument or the hedged items,
	the fair value of the portion of the hedging relationship
	determined to be ineffective will be recognized as a gain or
	loss in the combined and consolidated statements of operations.


	 





	Fixed
	Assets





	 


	Fixed assets consist of furniture, fixtures and equipment,
	leasehold improvements, and computer hardware and software and
	are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
	amortization. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line
	method over the assets estimated useful lives, which for
	leasehold improvements are the lesser of the lease terms or the
	life of the asset, and three to seven years for other fixed
	assets. Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
	or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
	an asset may not be recoverable.


	 





	Intangible
	Assets and Goodwill





	 


	The Companys intangible assets consist of acquired
	contractual rights to earn future fee income, including
	management and advisory fees, customer relationships, and
	acquired trademarks. Finite-lived intangible assets are
	amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from
	three to ten years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever
	events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
	amount of the asset may not be recoverable.


	 


	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net
	assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional
	currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is recognized as an
	asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of
	October 1st and between annual tests when events and
	circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.


	 





	Due to
	Carlyle Partners





	 


	The Company recognizes a distribution from capital and
	distribution payable to the individual Carlyle partners when
	services are rendered and carried interest allocations are
	earned. Also

	included are certain amounts due to partners related to the
	acquisition of Claren Road Asset Management, LLC, its
	subsidiaries, and Claren Road Capital, LLC (collectively,
	Claren Road), AlpInvest and ESG. Any unpaid
	distributions, which reflect the Companys obligation to
	those partners, are presented as due to Carlyle partners in the
	accompanying combined and consolidated balance sheets.


	 





	Deferred
	Revenue





	 


	Deferred revenue represents management fees and other revenue
	received prior to the balance sheet date, which have not yet
	been earned.


	 





	Comprehensive
	Income





	 


	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other
	comprehensive income. The Companys other comprehensive
	income is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
	hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments.


	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 



	Non-U.S. dollar

	denominated assets and liabilities are translated at period-end
	rates of exchange, and the combined and consolidated statements
	of operations are translated at rates of exchange in effect
	throughout the period. Foreign currency gains (losses) resulting
	from transactions outside of the functional currency of an
	entity of $3.4 million, $25.9 million and
	$(8.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2011,
	2010 and 2009, respectively, are included in general,
	administrative and other expenses in the combined and
	consolidated statements of operations.


	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 


	In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for fair value
	measurements and disclosures to converge U.S. GAAP and
	International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
	The amended guidance, included in ASU

	2011-04,


	Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
	Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP,

	is
	effective for the Company for its interim reporting period
	beginning after December 15, 2011. The amended guidance is
	generally clarifying in nature, but does change certain existing
	measurement principles in ASC 820 and requires additional
	disclosure about fair value measurements and unobservable
	inputs. The Company has not completed its assessment of the
	impact of this amended guidance, but does not expect the
	adoption to have a material impact on the Companys
	financial statements.


	 


	In June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on the presentation
	of comprehensive income. This guidance eliminates the option to
	report other comprehensive income and its components in the
	consolidated statement of changes in equity. An entity may elect
	to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in
	one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of
	comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive,
	statements. Each component of net income and of other
	comprehensive income needs to be displayed under either
	alternative. In December 2011, the FASB issued a final standard
	to defer the new requirement to present components of
	reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of
	the income statement. This guidance is effective for interim and
	annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The
	Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2012, and
	the adoption did not have a material impact on the
	Companys financial statements.


	 


	In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for testing
	goodwill for impairment by allowing an entity to use a
	qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. The

	guidance, included in ASU

	2011-08,


	Testing Goodwill for Impairment

	is effective
	for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning after
	December 15, 2011. The amended guidance is intended to
	reduce complexity by allowing an entity the option to make a
	qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill
	impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair
	value of a reporting unit. The Company does not expect the
	adoption to have a material impact on the Companys
	financial statements.


	 


	In December 2011, the FASB amended its guidance for offsetting
	financial instruments. The amended guidance, included in ASU

	2011-11,


	Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting
	Assets and Liabilities,

	is effective for the Company
	for its annual reporting period beginning on or after
	January 1, 2013. The amended guidance requires additional
	disclosure about netting arrangements to enable financial
	statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of
	such arrangements on an entitys financial position. The
	Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact
	on the Companys financial statements.

	Acquisitions
	and Acquired Intangible Assets







	 





	Acquisition
	of Churchill





	 


	On November 18, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of
	Churchill, a CLO asset manager focused on senior loans to
	middle-market companies. The Company consolidated the financial
	position and results of operations of Churchill effective
	November 18, 2011 and accounted for this transaction as a
	business combination. The consideration transferred in this
	acquisition consisted solely of the Companys assumption
	from the seller of certain operating liabilities of Churchill.
	The fair value of the assets acquired were approximately
	$8.1 million and the fair value of the liabilities assumed
	were $0.2 million, which resulted in a gain of
	$7.9 million, which is included in gain on business
	acquisition in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations. The CLO was determined to be a VIE, however, the
	Company was not determined to be the primary beneficiary and
	accordingly does not consolidate this CLO.


	 





	Acquisition
	of AlpInvest and ESG





	 


	On July 1, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of a
	60% equity interest in AlpInvest for total purchase
	consideration of approximately 138.4 million
	($199.3 million as of July 1, 2011), including the
	amount contributed by the 40% non-controlling interest holders.
	The Company consolidated the financial position and results of
	operations of AlpInvest effective July 1, 2011 and
	accounted for this transaction as a business combination. The
	Company also consolidated certain AlpInvest-managed funds
	effective July 1, 2011.


	 


	On July 1, 2011, the Company acquired 55% of ESG. The
	purchase price consisted of $45.0 million in cash, an
	ownership interest in Carlyle and performance-based contingent
	payments of up to $110.5 million, which is the maximum
	amount of additional consideration that could be paid, of which
	$73.5 million would be payable within five years of closing
	and $37.0 million would be payable by year six. The 45%
	interest entitles the holders, while employed by ESG, to 45% of
	the net cash flow profits from ESG, which is accounted for as a
	compensatory award. The Company consolidated the financial
	position and results of operations of ESG effective July 1,
	2011 and accounted for this transaction as a business
	combination. The Company also consolidated four ESG-managed
	funds effective July 1, 2011 and one additional ESG-managed
	fund for which it obtained control during the third quarter of
	2011.

	Goodwill recognized in connection
	with the acquisitions reflects the excess of the purchase price
	over the fair value of the tangible and specifically
	identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
	and is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising
	from the AlpInvest and ESG acquisitions is included in the
	Companys Fund of Funds Solutions and Global Market
	Strategies segments, respectively.





	 


	The fair value of the equity interests in the Company (in the
	form of limited partner interests in the Company) was based on
	both the contractual terms of the interests and an assumed
	enterprise valuation of the Company of approximately
	$10.0 billion. In valuing the Company for this purpose, a
	discounted cash-flow approach was utilized to assess the value
	of various cash-flow streams of the Company. In addition, a
	market multiple approach was utilized to corroborate on a macro
	basis the results of the discounted cash-flow approach. The fair
	value of the contingent consideration was based on
	probability-weighted discounted cash flow models. The contingent
	consideration associated with the AlpInvest acquisition relates
	to potential carried interest in certain existing AlpInvest
	funds that will be payable to the AlpInvest sellers if such
	carried interest is realized. In determining the
	acquisition-date fair value, the Company considered the expected
	carried interest to be realized, the potential variability of
	the amount of carried interest, and the expected timing of the
	realization. The acquisition-date fair value of the contingent
	consideration was $15.5 million and $60.4 million for
	the AlpInvest and ESG acquisitions, respectively. Of the total
	contingent consideration of $75.9 million,
	$56.2 million was recorded in due to Carlyle partners
	(related to

	Company) and $19.7 million was recorded in accounts
	payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.


	 


	These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs
	not observable in the market and thus represent Level III
	measurements as defined in the accounting guidance for fair
	value measurement. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value
	of the contingent consideration payable to the ESG sellers who
	are now partners of the Company was $69.7 million and has
	been included in due to Carlyle partners in the accompanying
	combined and consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair
	value of these amounts of $13.5 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 are recorded in members equity in
	the combined and consolidated balance sheets. As of
	December 31, 2011, the fair value of contingent
	consideration payable to non-Carlyle partners was
	$12.1 million and has been included in accounts payable,
	accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying
	combined and consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair
	value of the contingent consideration payable to non-Carlyle
	partners of $0.4 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 are recorded in other non-operating
	expenses in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations. Refer to Note 4 for additional disclosures
	related to the fair value of these instruments as of
	December 31, 2011. In connection with these transactions,
	the Company incurred approximately $8.9 million of
	acquisition costs that were recorded as an expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2011.

	Acquisition
	of Claren Road





	 


	On December 31, 2010, the Company acquired 55% of Claren
	Road, a credit hedge fund manager. The Company consolidates the
	financial position and results of operations of Claren Road
	effective December 31, 2010, and has accounted for this
	transaction as a business combination in the accompanying
	combined and consolidated financial statements. The Company also

	December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, these hedge
	funds had assets totaling $767.9 million.


	 


	The purchase consideration was comprised of $157.8 million
	in cash and promissory notes in the amount of
	$97.5 million. Also included in the consideration were
	contingently issuable equity

	interests in the Company equivalent to $51.3 million as of
	the closing date. The contingently issuable equity interests are
	subject to annual performance conditions over a period of four
	years and, once issued, may be redeemed for cash under certain
	circumstances. The contingently issuable equity interests have
	been accounted for as contingent consideration pursuant to
	ASC 805,

	Business Combinations

	. Assuming that all
	annual performance conditions are met, the amount of equity
	interests that could be issued would have a maximum aggregate
	value of $61.6 million and a minimum aggregate value of
	$41.0 million. Also, the Company may pay additional
	contingent consideration up to $146.7 million, which
	represents managements estimate of the maximum amount of
	consideration to be paid, over a period of ten years based on
	the achievement of certain performance criteria, including
	Assets Under Management (AUM) growth. The 45% interest entitles
	the holders, while employed by Claren Road, to 45% of the net
	cash flow profits from Claren Road and a separation payment once
	they cease employment, for which a $97.3 million liability
	was recorded as of December 31, 2010. The 45% interest is
	accounted for as a compensatory award. In connection with this
	transaction, the Company incurred approximately
	$2.9 million of acquisition costs that were recorded as an
	expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.


	 


	The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred

	Acquisition
	of CLO Management Contracts





	 


	In August, 2011, the Company purchased a management contract
	relating to a CLO managed by Foothill for approximately
	$8.6 million in cash. In August 2010, the Company purchased
	CLO management contracts from Stanfield Capital Partners, LLC
	for cash consideration of $50.6 million in cash. In
	December 2010, the Company purchased CLO management contracts
	from Mizuho Alternative Investment, LLC for cash consideration
	of $12.2 million. The acquired contractual rights are
	finite-lived intangible assets. Pursuant to the accounting
	guidance for consolidation, these CLOs are required to be
	consolidated and the results of the acquired CLOs have been
	included in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations since their acquisition. These transactions were
	accounted for as asset acquisitions.

	Fair
	Value Measurement






	 


	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a
	hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of
	market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at
	fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number
	of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the
	characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the
	state of the marketplace, including the existence and
	transparency of transactions between market participants.
	Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or
	for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in
	active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market
	price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in
	determining fair value.


	 


	Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are
	classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs
	used in the determination of fair values, as follows:


	 



	Level I

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for
	identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of
	financial instruments included in Level I include
	unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives,
	listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted
	price for these instruments, even in situations where the
	Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably
	impact the quoted price.


	 



	Level II

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets,
	which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
	reporting date. The type of

	Carlyle
	Group





	 




	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 



	financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and
	restricted securities listed in active markets, securities
	traded in other than active markets, government and agency
	securities, and certain

	over-the-counter

	derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.
	Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when
	their net asset value is redeemable without significant
	restriction.


	 



	Level III

	  inputs to the valuation
	methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair
	value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair
	value require significant management judgment or estimation.
	Financial instruments that are included in this category include
	investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade
	residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan
	obligations, and certain

	over-the-counter

	derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable
	inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in
	this category.


	 


	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall
	into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
	cases, the determination of which category within the fair value
	hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is
	based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
	fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the
	significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
	in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific
	to the financial instrument.


	 


	In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the
	basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market
	participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services.
	In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing
	services may use certain information with respect to
	transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers,
	pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments
	and various relationships between investments.


	 


	In the absence of observable market prices, the Company values
	its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a
	consistent basis. For some investments little market activity
	may exist. Managements determination of fair value is then
	based on the best information available in the circumstances and
	may incorporate managements own assumptions and involves a
	significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a
	combination of internal and external factors, including the
	appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity
	risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable
	include private investments in the equity of operating
	companies, real estate properties, and certain debt positions.
	The valuation technique for each of these investments is
	described below:


	 



	Corporate Private Equity Investments

	  The fair
	values of corporate private equity investments are determined by
	reference to projected net earnings, earnings before interest,
	taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the
	discounted cash flow method, public market or private
	transactions, valuations for comparable companies and other
	measures which, in many cases, are unaudited at the time
	received. Valuations may be derived by reference to observable
	valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions
	(e.g., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee
	company such as EBITDA by a relevant valuation multiple observed
	in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted
	by management for differences between the investment and the
	referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to
	option pricing models or other similar models. Certain fund
	investments in the Companys real assets, global market
	strategies and fund of funds solutions segments are comparable
	to corporate private equity and are valued in accordance with
	these policies.

	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 




	Real Estate Investments

	  The fair values of
	real estate investments are determined by considering projected
	operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and
	replacement costs, among other measures. The methods used to
	estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the
	discounted cash flow method

	and/or

	capitalization rates (cap rates) analysis.
	Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation
	measures for comparable assets (e.g., multiplying a key
	performance metric of the investee asset, such as net operating
	income, by a relevant cap rate observed in the range of
	comparable transactions), adjusted by management for differences
	between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in
	some instances by reference to pricing models or other similar
	methods. Additionally, where applicable, projected distributable
	cash flow through debt maturity will also be considered in
	support of the investments carrying value.


	 



	Credit-Oriented Investments

	  The fair values
	of credit-oriented investments are generally determined on the
	basis of prices between market participants provided by
	reputable dealers or pricing services. Specifically, for
	investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds,
	the fair values are generally determined by valuations of
	comparable investments. In some instances, the Company may
	utilize other valuation techniques, including the discounted
	cash flow method.


	 



	CLO Investments and CLO Loans Payable

	  The
	Company has elected the fair value option to measure the loans
	payable of the CLOs at fair value subsequent to the date of
	initial adoption of the new consolidation rules, as the Company
	has determined that measurement of the loans payable and
	preferred shares issued by the CLOs at fair value better
	correlates with the value of the assets held by the CLOs, which
	are held to provide the cash flows for the note obligations. The
	investments of the CLOs are also carried at fair value.


	 


	The fair values of the CLO loan and bond assets were primarily
	based on quotations from reputable dealers or relevant pricing
	services. In situations where valuation quotations are
	unavailable, the assets are valued based on similar securities,
	market index changes, and other factors. The fair values of the
	CLO loans payable and the CLO structured asset positions were
	determined based on both discounted cash flow analyses and
	third-party quotes. Those analyses considered the position size,
	liquidity, current financial condition of the CLOs, the
	third-party financing environment, reinvestment rates, recovery
	lags, discount rates, and default forecasts and is compared to
	broker quotations from market makers and third party dealers.
	Generally, the bonds and loans in the CLOs are not actively
	traded and are classified as Level III.


	 


	The Company corroborates quotations from pricing services either
	with other available pricing data or with its own models.


	 



	Fund Investments

	  The Companys
	investments in funds are valued based on its proportionate share
	of the net assets provided by the third party general partners
	of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent
	available information which is typically a lag of up to
	90 days. The terms of the investments generally preclude
	the ability to redeem the investment. Distributions from these
	investments will be received as the underlying assets in the
	funds are liquidated, the timing of which cannot be readily
	determined.

	Senior
	Secured Credit Facility





	 


	At December 31, 2011, the Company had in place a senior
	secured credit facility with certain financial institutions
	under which it may borrow up to $500.0 million in a term
	loan and $750.0 million in a revolving credit facility. The
	term loan and revolving credit facility mature on
	September 30, 2016. Principal amounts outstanding under the
	amended term loan and revolving credit facility accrue interest,
	at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate
	base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or
	(b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.75%
	(2.05% at December 31, 2011). As of December 31, 2011
	and 2010, $500.0 million was

	The senior secured credit facility is secured by management fees
	and carried interest allocable to the partners of the Company
	from certain funds and requires the Company to comply with
	certain financial and other covenants, which include maintaining
	management fee earning assets of at least $50.1 billion, a
	senior debt leverage ratio of less than or equal to 2.5 to 1.0,
	a total debt leverage ratio of less than 5.5 to 1.0, and a
	minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.0 to 1.0, in
	each case, tested on a quarterly basis. The senior secured
	credit facility also contains non-financial covenants that
	restrict some of the Companys corporate activities,
	including its ability to incur additional debt, pay certain
	dividends, create liens, make certain acquisitions or
	investments and engage in specified transactions with
	affiliates. Non-compliance with any of the financial or
	non-financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute
	an event of default under the senior secured credit facility. An
	event of default resulting from a breach of a financial or
	non-financial covenant may result, at the option of the lenders,
	in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding,
	and a termination of the revolving credit facility. The senior
	secured credit facility also contains other customary events of
	default, including defaults based on events of bankruptcy and
	insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest or fees when due,
	breach of specified covenants, change in control and material
	inaccuracy of representations and warranties. The Company was in
	compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants for
	the senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2011.


	 


	As of December 31, 2011, $310.9 million was
	outstanding under the revolving credit facility. No amounts were
	outstanding under the revolving credit facility at
	December 31, 2010. The Companys weighted average
	balance outstanding during 2011 was $203.4 million.


	 


	Total interest expense under the Senior Secured Credit Facility
	was $20.9 million, $17.3 million and
	$26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011,
	2010 and 2009, respectively, which includes $1.1 million,
	$1.6 million and $2.8 million in amortization of
	deferred financing costs, respectively. The fair value of the
	outstanding term loan and revolving credit facility in the
	senior secured credit facility approximates par value at
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.


	 


	The Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its
	variable rate debt financing. To manage this risk, the Company
	entered into an interest rate swap in March 2008 to fix the
	interest rate on approximately 33% of the $725.0 million in
	term loan borrowings at 5.069%. The interest rate swap had an
	initial notional balance of $239.2 million and amortizes
	through August 20, 2013 (the swaps maturity date) as
	the related term loan borrowings are repaid. This instrument was
	designated as a cash flow hedge and remains in place after the
	amendment of the senior secured credit facility.


	 


	In December 2011, the Company entered into a second interest
	rate swap to fix the interest rate at 2.832% on the remaining
	term loan borrowings not hedged by the March 2008 interest rate
	swap. This interest rate swap matures on September 30,
	2016, which coincides with the maturity of the term loan. This
	instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge.


	 


	The effective portion of losses related to the changes in the
	fair value of the swaps of $4.3 million, $7.3 million
	and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31,
	2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are included in accumulated
	other comprehensive loss in the combined and

	consolidated balance sheets. The ineffective portion of losses
	recognized in earnings were not significant for any period
	presented.


	 


	On December 13, 2011, the Company entered into a new senior
	credit facility. The new senior credit facility, while currently
	effective, will not become operative unless and until certain
	conditions are satisfied, including the consummation of a
	Qualified IPO, the redemption, repurchase or conversion of the
	notes issued to Mubadala, and the repayment of borrowings under
	the revolving credit facility of the existing senior secured
	credit facility used to finance distributions, if any, to its
	existing owners. If and when the new senior credit facility
	becomes operative, it will replace the existing senior secured
	credit facility, amounts borrowed under the existing senior
	secured credit facility will be deemed to have been repaid by
	borrowings in like amount under the new senior credit facility,
	and the Company will no longer be subject to the financial and
	other covenants of the existing senior secured credit facility.


	 


	The new senior credit facility will include $500.0 million
	in a term loan and $750.0 million in a revolving credit
	facility. The new term loan and revolving credit facility will
	mature on September 30, 2016. Principal amounts outstanding
	under the new term loan and revolving credit facility will
	accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either
	(a) at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not
	to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin
	not to exceed 1.75%. Outstanding principal amounts due under the
	term loan are payable quarterly beginning in September 2014 as
	follows: $75.0 million in 2014, $175.0 million in 2015
	and $250.0 million in 2016. The new senior credit facility
	will be unsecured and will not be guaranteed by any subsidiaries
	of the Company. The Company will be required to maintain
	management fee earning assets (as defined in the new senior
	credit facility) of at least $50.1 billion and a total debt
	leverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0. The Company will be
	permitted to incur secured indebtedness in an amount not greater
	than $125.0 million, subject to certain other permitted
	liens. The Company will not be subject to a senior debt leverage
	ratio or a minimum interest coverage ratio.


	 





	Other
	Loans





	 


	As part of the Claren Road acquisition, the Company entered into
	a loan agreement for $47.5 million. The loan matures on
	December 31, 2015 and interest is payable semi-annually,
	commencing June 30, 2011 at an adjustable annual rate,
	currently 6.0%. Total interest expense was $2.9 million for

	$50.0 million. The loan matures on January 3, 2017 and
	interest is payable quarterly, commencing March 31, 2011 at
	an annual rate of 8.0%. Total interest expense was
	$3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
	Outstanding principal amounts are payable quarterly beginning
	April 29, 2011 and vary based on annual gross revenue as
	defined in the loan agreement. Beginning April 3, 2013
	additional quarterly principal payments will commence equal to
	the lesser of (a) $2.0 million and (b) the then
	unpaid principal amount of the loan. As of December 31,
	2011, $10.0 million in principal remains outstanding and
	was subsequently repaid in 2012.

	Debt
	Covenants





	 


	The Company is subject to various financial covenants under its
	loan agreements including among other items, maintenance of a
	minimum amount of management fee earning assets. The Company is
	also subject to various non-financial covenants under its loan
	agreements. The Company was in compliance with all financial and
	non-financial covenants under its various loan agreements as of
	December 31, 2011.


	 





	Subordinated
	Loan Payable to Affiliate





	 


	In December 2010, the Company received net cash proceeds of
	$494.0 million from Mubadala in exchange for
	$500.0 million in subordinated notes, a 2% equity interest
	in the Company and additional rights as described below. In the
	event that a qualified initial public offering (Qualified
	IPO) does not occur within two years of this transaction,
	the Company is required to issue an additional equity interest
	in the Company of 0.25% to Mubadala. If a Qualified IPO does not
	occur within five years of this transaction, the Company is
	required to issue an additional equity interest in the Company
	of 0.25% to Mubadala.


	 


	The notes mature on December 31, 2020 and are exchangeable
	for additional equity interests in the Company at
	Mubadalas option in the event of a Qualified IPO within
	five years of this transaction at a 7.5% discount to the IPO
	price. If a Qualified IPO has not occurred within this period of
	time, Mubadala has the option to require the Company to redeem
	the notes for the then outstanding principal amount of the notes
	being redeemed, together with any applicable accrued and unpaid
	interest through the redemption date. From and after
	December 31, 2017, any note may be voluntarily redeemed at
	the election of the Company for the then outstanding principal
	amount of the notes being redeemed, together with any applicable
	accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.


	 


	Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually, commencing
	June 30, 2011 at a rate of 7.25% per annum to the extent
	paid in cash or 7.5% per annum to the extent paid by issuing

	payment-in-kind

	notes (PIK Notes). Interest payable on the first
	interest payment date is payable in cash. For any subsequent
	interest period, the Company may elect to pay up to 50% of the
	interest payment due by issuing PIK Notes on the same terms and
	conditions as the originally issued notes. Further, the Company
	may pay up to 50% of the interest payment due on any PIK Notes
	by issuing additional PIK Notes. Total interest expense was
	$33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.


	 


	On October 20, 2011, the Company borrowed
	$265.5 million under its revolving credit facility to
	redeem $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
	subordinated notes for a redemption price of
	$260.0 million, representing a 4% premium, plus accrued
	interest of approximately $5.5 million. As a result, an
	aggregate of $250.0 million principal amount of notes
	remain outstanding at December 31, 2011.


	 


	The Company has elected the fair value option to measure the
	subordinated notes at fair value. At December 31, 2011 and
	2010, the fair value of the subordinated notes was
	$262.5 million and $494.0 million, respectively. The
	primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to
	(i) reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis
	and (ii) address simplification and cost-benefit
	considerations. Changes in the fair value of this instrument of
	$28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 are
	recognized in earnings and included in other non-operating
	expenses in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations.


	 


	The fair value of the subordinated notes is determined based
	upon modeling their expected cash flows including factoring the
	value of the embedded put and call features and the probability
	of conversion upon a Qualified IPO. The cash flows are then
	discounted at a market rate which is

	Notes to

	derived by comparison to comparable benchmark securities. The
	comparable benchmark securities were for companies in the
	private equity industry similar to the Company and the current
	yields were adjusted accordingly based on the terms, tenure,
	seniority, and credit risk for each security. As the probability
	of a Qualified IPO increases, the value of the notes increases
	and any value associated with the embedded put and call features
	decreases. In addition, the period of time over which the
	expected cash flows are discounted also decreases, which lessens
	the impact that changes in credit spreads have on the valuation
	of the notes. The December 31, 2011 valuation at 105% of
	par primarily reflects the increased probability of a Qualified
	IPO and to a lesser extent, the change in credit spreads. Refer
	to Note 4 for additional disclosures related to the fair
	value of these instruments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.


	 


	The Company accounted for the equity interests issued to
	Mubadala as an upfront cost related to the issuance of the
	subordinated notes. Because the Company elected the fair value
	option to account for the subordinated notes, the Company
	recognized the fair value of the equity interests in earnings
	during the year ended December 31, 2010 and presented the
	$214.0 million expense as equity issued for affiliate debt
	financing in the combined and consolidated statements of
	operations. The charge assumed a Company valuation of
	approximately $10.0 billion and gives consideration to the
	contingent equity grant of up to an additional 0.5% as described
	above. In valuing the Company for this purpose, a discounted
	cash-flow approach was utilized to assess the value of various
	cashflow streams of the Company. In addition, a market multiple
	approach was utilized to corroborate on a macro basis the
	results of the discounted cash flow approach.


	 





	Loans
	Payable of Consolidated Funds





	 


	Loans payable of Consolidated Funds represent amounts due to
	holders of debt securities issued by the CLOs. Several of the
	CLOs issued preferred shares representing the most subordinated
	interest, however these tranches are mandatorily redeemable upon
	the maturity dates of the senior secured loans payable, and as a
	result have been classified as liabilities, and are included in
	loans payable of Consolidated Funds in the combined and
	consolidated balance sheets.


	 


	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the following borrowings
	were outstanding, which includes preferred shares classified as

	(a)






	The subordinated notes, income
	notes and preferred shares do not have contractual interest
	rates, but instead receive distributions from the excess cash
	flows of the CLOs.





	 





	(b)






	The combination notes do not have
	contractual interest rates and have recourse only to U.S.
	Treasury securities and OATS specifically held to collateralize
	such combination notes.





	 


	Loans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held
	by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy
	the liabilities of another. This collateral consisted of cash
	and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other
	securities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair
	value of the CLO assets was $11.0 billion and
	$11.9 billion, respectively. Included in loans payable of
	the CLOs are loan revolvers (the APEX Revolvers), which the CLOs
	entered into with financial institutions on their respective
	closing dates. The APEX Revolvers provide credit enhancement to
	the securities issued by the CLOs by allowing the CLOs to draw
	down on the revolvers in order to offset a certain level of
	principal losses upon any default of the investment assets held
	by that CLO. The APEX Revolvers allow for a maximum borrowing of
	$38.3 million and $84.8 million as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and bear weighted
	average interest at LIBOR plus 0.37% and 0.41% per annum as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amounts borrowed
	under the APEX Revolvers are repaid based on cash flows
	available subject to priority of payments under each CLOs
	governing documents. Due to their short-term nature, the Company
	has elected not to apply the fair value option to the APEX
	revolvers; rather, they are carried at amortized cost at each
	reporting date which the Company believes approximates fair
	value. There were no outstanding principal amounts borrowed
	under the APEX Revolvers as of December 31, 2011. The
	principal amounts borrowed under the APEX Revolvers as of
	December 31, 2010 were $15.0 million.


	 


	Certain CLOs entered into liquidity facility agreements with
	various liquidity facility providers on or about the various
	closing dates in order to fund payments of interest where there
	are insufficient funds available. The proceeds from such
	draw-downs are used for payments of interest at each interest
	payment date and the acquisition or exercise of an option or
	warrant as part of any collateral enhancement obligation. The
	liquidity facilities in aggregate allow for a maximum borrowing
	of $12.9 million and bear weighted average interest at
	EURIBOR plus 0.25% per annum. Amounts borrowed under the
	liquidity facilities are repaid based on cash flows available
	subject to priority of payments under each CLOs governing
	documents. There were no borrowings outstanding under the
	liquidity facility as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

	Commitments

	Capital
	Commitments





	 


	The Company and its unconsolidated affiliates have unfunded

	In addition to these unfunded commitments, the Company may from
	time to time exercise its right to purchase additional interests
	in its investment funds that become available in the ordinary
	course of their operations.


	 





	Guaranteed
	Loans





	 


	On August 4, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement
	with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company is
	the guarantor on a credit facility for eligible employees
	investing in Carlyle sponsored funds. This credit facility
	renews on an annual basis, allowing for annual incremental
	borrowings up to an aggregate of $16.1 million, and accrues
	interest at the lower of the prime rate, as defined, or
	three-month LIBOR plus 2% (3.25% at December 31, 2011),
	reset quarterly. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
	approximately $14.3 million and $19.5 million,
	respectively, was outstanding under the credit facility and
	payable by the employees. The amount funded by the Company under
	this guarantee as of December 31, 2011 was not material.
	The Company believes the likelihood of any material funding
	under this guarantee to be remote. The fair value of this
	guarantee is not significant to the combined and consolidated
	financial statements.


	 





	Other
	Guarantees





	 


	In 2009, the Company decided to shut down one of its real assets
	funds and guaranteed to reimburse investors of the fund for
	capital contributions made for investments and fees to the
	extent investment proceeds did not cover such amounts. In
	December 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase
	investors interests in the fund and the related obligation
	of $5.2 million is included in the accompanying combined
	and consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2010.
	This obligation was settled in January 2011 and the Company has
	no liabilities related to this transaction at December 31,
	2011.


	 


	The Company has guaranteed payment of giveback obligations, if
	any, related to one of its corporate private equity funds to the
	extent the amount of funds reserved for potential giveback
	obligations is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations. At
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, $13.6 million and
	$14.9 million, respectively, was held in an escrow account
	and the Company believes the likelihood of any material fundings
	under this guarantee to be remote.


	 





	Contingent
	Obligations (Giveback)





	 


	A liability for potential repayment of previously received
	performance fees of $136.5 million at December 31,
	2011, is shown as accrued giveback obligations in the combined
	and consolidated balance sheets, representing the giveback
	obligation that would need to be paid if the funds were

	liquidated at their current fair values at December 31,
	2011. However, the ultimate giveback obligation, if any, does
	not become realized until the end of a funds life (see
	Note 2). The Company has recorded $56.5 million and
	$38.8 million, of unbilled receivables from former and
	current employees and Carlyles individual partners as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to
	giveback obligations, which are included in due from affiliates
	and other receivables, net in the accompanying combined and
	consolidated balance sheets. Current and former partners and
	employees are personally responsible for their giveback
	obligations. The receivables are collateralized by investments
	made by individual partners and employees in Carlyle-sponsored
	funds. In addition, $250.8 million and $193.6 million
	has been withheld from distributions of carried interest to
	partners and employees for potential giveback obligations as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such amounts are
	held by an entity not included in the accompanying combined and
	consolidated balance sheets.


	 


	If, at December 31, 2011, all of the investments held by
	the Companys Funds were deemed worthless, a possibility
	that management views as remote, the amount of realized and
	distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would
	be $856.7 million, on an after-tax basis where applicable.


	 





	Leases





	 


	The Company leases office space in various countries around the
	world and maintains its headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
	where it leases its primary office space under a non-cancelable
	lease agreement expiring on July 31, 2026. In the first
	quarter of 2011, the Company entered into a lease agreement for
	office space in Arlington, VA, expiring on June 30, 2022.
	Office leases in other locations expire in various years from
	2011 through 2020. These leases are accounted for as operating
	leases. Rent expense was approximately $43.7 million,
	$32.6 million and $43.4 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is
	included in general, administrative and other expenses in the
	combined and consolidated statements of operations. Included in
	rent expense are lease termination costs of $1.7 million,
	$1.7 million and $16.5 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.


	 


	The future minimum commitments for the leases are as follows

	Legal
	Matters





	 


	In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to
	litigation, investigations, disputes and other potential claims.
	Certain of these matters are described below. The Company is not
	currently able to estimate for any such matters the reasonably
	possible amount of loss or range of loss. The Company does not
	believe it is probable that the outcome of any existing
	litigation, investigations, disputes or other potential claims
	will materially affect the Company or these financial statements.


	 


	In May 2009, the Company reached resolution with the Office of
	the Attorney General of the State of New York (the NYAG)
	regarding the NYAGs inquiry into the use of placement
	agents by various investment managers, including Carlyle, to
	solicit New York public pension funds for private equity and
	hedge fund investment commitments. The Company agreed to pay
	$20.0 million to New York State.


	 


	Along with many other companies and individuals in the financial
	sector, the Company and Carlyle Mezzanine Partners are named as
	defendants in

	Foy v. Austin Capital

	, a case filed in
	June 2009, pending in the State of New Mexicos First
	Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, which purports
	to be a

	qui tam

	suit on behalf of the State of New
	Mexico. The suit alleges that investment decisions by New Mexico
	public investment funds were improperly influenced by campaign
	contributions and payments to politically connected placement
	agents. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, actual damages,
	actual damages for lost income, rescission of the investment
	transactions described in the complaint and disgorgement of all
	fees received. In May 2011, the Attorney General of New Mexico
	moved to dismiss certain defendants including the Company and
	Carlyle Mezzanine Partners on the ground that separate civil
	litigation by the Attorney General is a more effective means to
	seek recovery for the State from these defendants. The Attorney
	General has brought two civil actions against certain of those
	defendants, not including the Carlyle defendants. The Attorney
	General has stated that its investigation is continuing and it
	may bring additional civil actions. The Company is currently
	unable to anticipate when the litigation will conclude or what
	impact the litigation may have on the Company and its interest
	holders.


	 


	In July 2009, a former shareholder of Carlyle Capital
	Corporation Limited (CCC), claiming to have lost
	$20.0 million, filed a claim against CCC, the Company and
	certain affiliates and one officer of the Company
	(

	Huffington v. TC Group L.L.C., et al.

	) alleging
	violations of Massachusetts blue sky law provisions
	relating to material misrepresentations and omissions allegedly
	made during and after the marketing of CCC. The plaintiff seeks
	treble damages, interest, expenses and attorneys fees and
	to have the subscription agreement deemed null and void and a
	full refund of the investment. In March 2010, the United States
	District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the
	plaintiffs complaint on the grounds that it should have
	been filed in Delaware instead of Massachusetts, and the
	plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the United
	States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The plaintiff
	lost his appeal to the First Circuit and has filed a new claim
	in Delaware State Court. Defendants are awaiting a ruling on a
	motion for summary judgment. The defendants are vigorously
	contesting all claims asserted by the plaintiff.


	 


	In November 2009, another CCC investor instituted legal
	proceedings on similar grounds in Kuwaits Court of First
	Instance (

	National Industries Group v. Carlyle
	Group

	) seeking to recover losses incurred in connection with
	an investment in CCC. In July 2011, the Delaware Court of
	Chancery issued a decision restraining the plaintiff from
	proceeding in Kuwait against either Carlyle Investment
	Management L.L.C. or TC Group, L.L.C., based on the forum
	selection clause in the plaintiffs subscription agreement,
	which provided for exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts. In
	September 2011, the plaintiff reissued its complaint in Kuwait
	naming CCC only, but, in December 2011, expressed an intent to
	reissue its complaint joining Carlyle Investment Management
	L.L.C. as a

	and intends to vigorously contest all such allegations and is
	currently unable to anticipate what impact they may have on the
	Company.


	 


	The Guernsey liquidators who took control of CCC in March 2008
	filed four suits in July 2010 against the Company, certain of
	its affiliates and the former directors of CCC in the Delaware
	Chancery Court, the Royal Court of Guernsey, the Superior Court
	of the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court of New York,
	New York County, (

	Carlyle Capital Corporation Limited v.
	Conway et al.

	) seeking $1.0 billion in damages. They
	allege that the Company and the CCC board of directors were
	negligent, grossly negligent or willfully mismanaged the CCC
	investment program and breached certain fiduciary duties
	allegedly owed to CCC and its shareholders. The Liquidators
	further allege (among other things) that the directors and the
	Company put the interests of the Company ahead of the interests
	of CCC and its shareholders and gave priority to preserving and
	enhancing the Companys reputation and its
	brand over the best interests of CCC. The defendants
	filed a comprehensive motion to dismiss in Delaware in October
	2010. In December 2010, the Liquidators dismissed the complaint
	in Delaware voluntarily and without prejudice and expressed an
	intent to proceed against the defendants in Guernsey. The
	Company filed an action in Delaware seeking an injunction
	against the Liquidators to preclude them from proceeding in
	Guernsey in violation of a Delaware exclusive jurisdiction
	clause contained in the investment management agreement. In July
	2011, the Royal Court of Guernsey held that the case should be
	litigated in Delaware pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction
	clause. That ruling was appealed by the Liquidators, and in
	February 2012 was reversed by the Guernsey Court of Appeal,
	which held that the case should proceed in Guernsey. The Company
	intends to seek review of that ruling pursuant to an application
	for special leave to the Privy Council. Also, in October 2011,
	the plaintiffs obtained an ex parte anti-anti-suit injunction in
	Guernsey against the Companys anti-suit claim in Delaware.
	That ruling also is on appeal in Guernsey. The Liquidators
	lawsuits in New York and the District of Columbia were dismissed
	in December 2011 without prejudice. The Company believes that
	regardless of where the claims are litigated, they are without
	merit and it will vigorously contest all allegations. The
	Company recognized a loss of $152.3 million in 2008 in
	connection with the winding up of CCC.


	 


	In June 2011, August 2011, and September 2011, three putative
	shareholder class actions were filed against the Company,
	certain of its affiliates and former directors of CCC alleging
	that the fund offering materials and various public disclosures
	were materially misleading or omitted material information. Two
	of the shareholder class actions, (

	Phelps v. Stomber, et
	al.)

	and (

	Glaubach v. Carlyle Capital Corporation
	Limited, et al

	.), were filed in the United States District
	Court for the District of Columbia. The most recent shareholder
	class action (

	Phelps v. Stomber, et al.)

	was filed
	in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County and has
	subsequently been removed to the United States District Court
	for the Southern District of New York. The two original D.C.
	cases were consolidated into one case, under the caption of
	Phelps v. Stomber, and the Phelps named plaintiffs have
	been designated lead plaintiffs by the court. The
	New York case has been transferred to the D.C. federal court and
	the plaintiffs have requested that it be consolidated with the
	other two D.C. actions. The defendants have opposed and have
	moved to dismiss the case as duplicative. The plaintiffs seek
	all compensatory damages sustained as a result of the alleged
	misrepresentations, costs and expenses, as well as reasonable
	attorney fees. The defendants have filed a comprehensive motion
	to dismiss. We believe the claims are without merit and will
	vigorously contest all claims.


	 


	In September 2006 and March 2009, the Company received requests
	for certain documents and other information from the Antitrust
	Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
	(DOJ) in connection with the DOJs
	investigation of global alternative asset firms to determine
	whether they have engaged in conduct prohibited by
	U.S. antitrust laws. The Company is fully cooperating with

	the DOJs investigation and is currently unable to
	anticipate what impact it may have on the Company.


	 


	On February 14, 2008, a private

	class-action

	lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged
	anti-competitive business practices was filed in the
	U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
	(

	Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of
	Detroit v. Apollo Global Management, LLC

	). The
	complaint alleges, among other things, that certain global
	alternative firms, including the Company, violated
	Section 1 of the Sherman Act by forming multi-sponsor
	consortiums for the purpose of bidding collectively in company
	buyout actions in certain going private transactions, which the
	plaintiffs allege constitutes a conspiracy in restraint of
	trade. The plaintiffs seek damages as provided for in
	Section 4 of the Clayton Act and injunction against such
	conduct in restraint of trade in the future. The Company
	believes the claims are without merit and will vigorously
	contest all claims and is currently unable to anticipate what
	impact it may have on the Company.


	 





	Other
	Contingencies





	 


	From 2007 to 2009, a Luxembourg portfolio company owned by
	Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners, L.P. received proceeds from
	the sale of real estate located in Paris, France. Carlyle Europe
	Real Estate Partners, L.P. is a real estate fund not
	consolidated by the Company. The relevant French tax authorities
	have asserted that such portfolio company had a permanent
	establishment in France, and have issued a tax assessment
	seeking to collect 88.2 million, consisting of taxes,
	interest and penalties. The portfolio company is contesting the
	French tax assessment and exploring settlement opportunities.
	Although neither Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners, L.P. nor
	the portfolio company are consolidated by the Company, the
	Company may determine to advance amounts to such
	non-consolidated entities or otherwise incur costs to resolve
	the matter, in which case the Company would seek to recover such
	advance from proceeds of subsequent portfolio dispositions by
	Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners, L.P. The amount of any
	unrecoverable costs that may be incurred by the Company is not
	estimable at this time.


	 





	Indemnifications





	 


	In the normal course of business, the Company and its
	subsidiaries enter into contracts that contain a variety of
	representations and warranties and provide general
	indemnifications. The Companys maximum exposure under
	these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future
	claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet
	occurred. However, based on experience, the Company believes the
	risk of material loss to be remote.


	 





	Risks
	and Uncertainties





	 


	The funds seek investment opportunities that offer the
	possibility of attaining substantial capital appreciation.
	Certain events particular to each industry in which the
	underlying investees conduct their operations, as well as
	general economic conditions, may have a significant negative
	impact on the Companys investments and profitability. Such
	events are beyond the Companys control, and the likelihood
	that they may occur and the effect on the Company cannot be
	predicted.


	 


	Furthermore, most of the funds investments are made in
	private companies and there are generally no public markets for
	the underlying securities at the current time. The funds
	ability to liquidate their publicly-traded investments are often
	subject to limitations, including discounts that may be required
	to be taken on quoted prices due to the number of shares being
	sold. The funds ability to liquidate their investments and
	realize value are subject to significant limitations and
	uncertainties, including among others currency fluctuations and
	natural disasters.

	The funds make investments outside of the United States.

	Non-U.S. investments

	are subject to the same risks associated with the Companys
	U.S. investments as well as additional risks, such as
	fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, unexpected
	changes in regulatory requirements, heightened risk of political
	and economic instability, difficulties in managing

	non-U.S. investments,

	potentially adverse tax consequences and the burden of complying
	with a wide variety of foreign laws.


	 


	Furthermore, Carlyle is exposed to economic risk concentrations
	related to certain large investments as well as concentrations
	of investments in certain industries and geographies.


	 


	Additionally, the Company encounters credit risk. Credit risk is
	the risk of default by a counterparty in the Companys
	investments in debt securities, loans, leases and derivatives
	that result from a borrowers, lessees or derivative
	counterpartys inability or unwillingness to make required
	or expected payments.


	 


	The Company considers cash, cash equivalents, securities,
	receivables, equity-method investments, accounts payable,
	accrued expenses, other liabilities, loans payable, assets and
	liabilities of Consolidated Funds and contingent and other
	consideration for acquistions to be its financial instruments.
	The carrying amounts reported in the combined and consolidated
	balance sheets for these financial instruments equal or closely
	approximate their fair values.


	 





	Termination
	Costs





	 


	Employee and office lease termination costs are included in
	accrued compensation and benefits and accrued expenses in the
	combined and consolidated balance sheets as well as general,
	administrative and other expenses in the combined and
	consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,
	2011 and 2010, the accrual for termination costs primarily
	represents lease obligations associated with the closed offices,
	which represents managements estimate of the total amount
	expected to be incurred. The changes in the accrual for
	termination costs for the years ended December 31, 2011,
	2010 and 2009 are as follows:

	Other receivables from certain of the unconsolidated funds and
	portfolio companies relate to management fees receivable from
	limited partners, advisory fees receivable and expenses paid on
	behalf of these entities. These costs represent costs related to
	the pursuit of actual or proposed investments, professional fees
	and expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and
	disposition of the investments. The affiliates are obligated at
	the discretion of the Company to reimburse the expenses. Based
	on managements determination, the Company accrues and
	charges interest on amounts due from affiliate accounts at
	interest rates ranging from 0% to 8%. The accrued and charged
	interest to the affiliates was not significant during the years
	ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.


	 


	The Company has provided loans to certain unconsolidated funds
	to meet short-term obligations to purchase investments. These
	notes accrue interest at rates specified in each agreement,
	ranging from one-month LIBOR plus 2.15% (2.45% at
	December 31, 2011) to 18%.


	 


	These receivables are assessed periodically for collectibility
	and amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly
	to general, administrative and other expenses in the combined
	and consolidated statements of operations. A corresponding
	allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded and such amounts
	were not significant for any period presented.

	Company accrues and pays interest on the amounts due to
	affiliates at interest rates ranging from 0% to the prime rate,
	as defined, plus 2% (5.25% at December 31, 2011). The
	interest incurred to the affiliates was not significant during
	the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
	respectively.


	 





	Sale
	of Investments





	 


	In September 2010, the Company sold an investment in a real
	estate venture (accounted for as an equity method investment) to
	one of its partners for $16.2 million. The difference
	between the purchase price and the carrying value of the
	investment was treated as an equity contribution.


	 







	Other
	Related Party Transactions





	 


	In May 2011, the Company and its affiliates invested
	41.0 million ($53.1 million as of
	December 31, 2011) and 52.2 million
	($67.6 million as of December 31, 2011), respectively,
	into one of its European real estate funds. The proceeds were
	used to refinance the funds existing loans. The
	Companys investment is recorded as an equity-method
	investment.


	 


	In the normal course of business, the Company has made use of
	aircraft owned by entities controlled by senior managing
	directors. The senior managing directors paid for their
	purchases of the aircraft and bear all operating, personnel and
	maintenance costs associated with their operation for personal
	use. Payment by the Company for the business use of these
	aircraft by senior managing directors and other employees is
	made at market rates, which totaled $5.7 million,
	$5.9 million and $5.8 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These fees
	are included in general, administrative, and other expenses in
	the combined and consolidated statements of operations.


	 


	Carlyle partners and employees are permitted to participate in
	co-investment entities that invest in Carlyle funds or alongside
	Carlyle funds. In many cases, participation is limited by law to
	individuals who qualify under applicable legal requirements.
	Although these co-investment entities require Carlyle partners
	and employees to pay their allocated partnership expenses, they
	generally do not require Carlyle partners and employees to pay
	management or performance fees.


	 


	Carried interest income from the funds can be distributed to
	Carlyle partners and employees on a current basis, but is
	subject to repayment by the subsidiary of Carlyle Group that
	acts as general partner of the fund in the event that certain
	specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The
	Carlyle partners and certain other investment professionals have
	personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the
	obligation of these subsidiaries in respect of this general
	partner obligation. Such guarantees are several and not joint
	and are limited to a particular individuals distributions
	received.


	 


	Substantially all revenue is earned from affiliates of Carlyle.

	Derivative
	Instruments in the CLOs







	 


	In the ordinary course of business, the CLOs enter into various
	types of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments serve as
	components of the CLOs investment strategies and are
	utilized primarily to structure and manage the risks related to
	currency, credit and interest exposure. The derivative
	instruments that the CLOs hold or issue do not qualify for hedge
	accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and
	hedging. The CLOs derivative instruments include currency
	swap contracts, currency options, credit risk swap contracts,
	and interest rate cap contracts, and are carried at fair value
	in the Companys combined and consolidated balance sheets.


	 


	Certain CLOs purchase put and call options to manage risk from
	changes in the value of foreign currencies. Certain CLOs entered
	into currency swap transactions, which represent agreements that

	stated at fair value and the difference between cash to be paid
	and received on swaps is recognized as net investment gains
	(losses) of Consolidated Funds in the combined and consolidated

	Certain derivative instruments contain provisions which require
	the CLOs or the counterparty to post collateral if certain
	conditions are met. Cash received to satisfy these collateral
	requirements is included in restricted cash and securities of
	Consolidated Funds (see Note 2) and in other
	liabilities of Consolidated Funds in the combined and
	consolidated balance sheets. The Company has elected not to
	offset derivative positions against the fair value of amounts
	(or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the
	right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the
	obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master
	netting arrangements.

	Under U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit
	to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more
	likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The
	Company has recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of
	$17.5 million and $17.2 million as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which is
	reflected in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
	liabilities in the accompanying combined and consolidated
	balance sheets. These balances include $3.9 million as of
	December 31, 2011 and 2010, related to interest and
	penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. If
	recognized, the entire amount of uncertain tax positions would
	be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.
	The total expense for interest and penalties related to
	unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
	2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $1.3 million,
	$1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.


	 


	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
	examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax
	regulators. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys
	U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2008 through
	2010 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations
	and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax
	returns are generally subject to audit from 2007 to 2010.
	Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2005 to
	2010. Certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are
	currently under audit by foreign tax authorities.


	 


	The Company does not believe that the outcome of these audits
	will require it to record reserves for uncertain tax positions
	or that the outcome will have a material impact on the combined
	and consolidated financial statements. The Company does not
	believe that it has any tax positions for which it is reasonably
	possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
	will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve
	months.

	Segment
	Reporting







	 


	Through December 31, 2011, Carlyle conducts its operations
	through four reportable segments:


	 



	Corporate Private Equity

	  The Corporate
	Private Equity segment is comprised of the Companys
	operations that advise a diverse group of funds that invest in
	buyout and growth capital transactions that focus on either a
	particular geography or a particular industry.


	 



	Real Assets

	  The Real Assets segment is
	comprised of the Companys operations that advises
	U.S. and international funds focused on real estate,
	infrastructure, energy and renewable energy transactions.


	 



	Global Market Strategies

	  The Global Market
	Strategies segment advises a group of funds that pursue
	investment opportunities across various types of credit,
	equities and alternative instruments, and (as regards certain
	macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities, sovereign
	debt, and interest rate products and their derivatives.

	Carlyle
	Group





	 




	Notes to
	the Combined and Consolidated Financial
	Statements  (Continued)




	 




	Fund of Funds Solutions

	  The Fund of Funds
	Solutions segment was launched upon the Companys
	acquisition of a 60% equity interest in AlpInvest on
	July 1, 2011 and advises a global private equity fund of
	funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities.


	 


	The Companys reportable business segments are
	differentiated by their various investment focuses and
	strategies. Overhead costs were allocated based on direct base
	compensation expense for the funds comprising each segment. With
	the acquisitions of Claren Road, AlpInvest and ESG, the Company
	revised how it evaluates certain financial information to
	include adjustments to reflect the Companys economic
	interests in those entities. The Companys segment
	presentation has been updated to reflect this change. As the
	results of operations of Claren Road, AlpInvest, and ESG are
	only included in the Companys 2011 segment results, this
	change did not have an impact on the presentation of segment
	results for prior periods.


	 


	Economic Net Income (ENI) and its components are key
	performance measures used by management to make operating
	decisions and assess the performance of the Companys
	reportable segments. ENI differs from income (loss) before
	provision for income taxes computed in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP in that it reflects a charge for compensation,
	bonuses and performance fees attributable to Carlyle partners
	but does not include net income (loss) attributable to
	non-Carlyle interests in Consolidated Funds or charges (credits)
	related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items.
	Charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and
	non-recurring items include amortization associated with
	acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with
	acquisitions, gains and losses associated with the mark to
	market on contingent consideration issued in conjunction with
	acquisitions, gains and losses from the retirement of debt,
	charges associated with lease terminations and employee
	severance and settlements of legal claims.


	 


	Fee related earnings (FRE) is a component of ENI and
	is used to assess the ability of the business to cover direct
	base compensation and operating expenses from total fee
	revenues. FRE differs from income (loss) before provision for
	income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that
	it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of ENI and
	also adjusts ENI to exclude performance fees, investment income
	from investments in Carlyle funds, and performance fee related
	compensation.


	 


	Distributable earnings is a component of ENI and is used to
	assess performance and amounts potentially available for
	distribution. Distributable earnings differs from income (loss)
	before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP in that it adjusts for the items included in the
	calculation of ENI and also adjusts ENI for unrealized
	performance fees, unrealized investment income and the
	corresponding unrealized performance fee compensation expense.


	 


	ENI and its components are used by management primarily in
	making resource deployment and compensation decisions across the
	Companys four reportable segments. Management makes
	operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of the
	Companys business segments based on financial and
	operating metrics and data that is presented without the
	consolidation of any of the Consolidated Funds. Consequently,
	ENI and all segment data exclude the assets, liabilities and
	operating results related to the Consolidated Funds.

	Adjustments to performance fees and
	investment income (loss) relate to amounts earned from the
	Consolidated Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP
	consolidation but were included in the segment results, and
	amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in
	consolidated entities, which were excluded from the segment
	results. Adjustments to performance fee related compensation
	expense relate to the inclusion of partner compensation in the
	segment results. Adjustments are also included in these
	financial statement captions for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 to reflect the Companys 55%
	economic interest in Claren Road and ESG and the Companys
	60% interest in AlpInvest in the segment results.

	The Total Assets adjustment represents the addition of the
	assets of the Consolidated Funds which were eliminated in
	consolidation to arrive at the Companys total assets.

	Subsequent
	Events







	 


	On February 28, 2012, the Company acquired four European
	CLO management contracts from Highland Capital Management L.P.
	for approximately 32.4 million. Gross assets of these
	CLOs are estimated to be approximately 2.1 billion at
	December 31, 2011. This transaction will be accounted for
	as an asset acquisition. The acquired contractual rights are
	finite-lived intangible assets. Pursuant to the accounting
	guidance for consolidation, these CLOs will be consolidated and
	the financial position and results of operations of the acquired
	CLOs will be included in the Companys combined and
	consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition.


	 


	On March 1, 2012, the Company borrowed $263.1 million under
	its revolving credit facility to redeem all of the remaining
	$250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
	subordinated notes held by Mubadala for a redemption price of
	$260.0 million, representing a 4% premium, plus accrued
	interest of approximately $3.1 million.


	 


	The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 14,
	2012, which is the date the financial statements were issued.

	Delaware Limited Partnership Act.


	 



	Section 2.8.

	  

	Title
	to Partnership Assets

	.


	 


	Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and
	whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by
	the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or
	collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such
	Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all
	of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the
	Partnership, the General Partner, one or more of its Affiliates
	or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine.
	The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any
	Partnership assets for which record title is held in the name of
	the General Partner or one or more of its Affiliates or one or
	more nominees shall be held by the General Partner or such
	Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership
	in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided
	however, that the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts
	to cause record title to such assets (other than those assets in
	respect of which the General Partner in its sole discretion
	determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes
	transfer of record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be
	vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable;
	provided further that prior to the withdrawal of the General
	Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General
	Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of
	record title to the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer,
	will provide for the use of such assets in a manner satisfactory
	to the General Partner. All Partnership assets shall be recorded
	as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
	irrespective of the name in which record title to such
	Partnership assets is held.


	 



	Section 2.9.

	  

	Certain
	Undertakings Relating to the Separateness of the Partnership

	.


	 


	(a) 

	Separateness Generally.

	  The
	Partnership shall conduct its business and operations separate
	and apart from those of any other Person (other than the General
	Partner) in accordance with this Section 2.9.


	 


	(b) 

	Separate Records.

	  The Partnership
	shall maintain (i) its books and records, (ii) its
	accounts, and (iii) its financial statements separate from
	those of any other Person except for a Person whose financial
	results are required to be consolidated with the financial
	results of the Partnership.


	 


	(c) 

	No Effect.

	  Failure by the General
	Partner or the Partnership to comply with any of the obligations
	set forth above shall not affect the status of the Partnership
	as a separate legal entity, with its separate assets and
	separate liabilities.

	No Limited Partner, in its capacity as such, shall participate
	in the operation, management or control (within the meaning of
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act) of the Partnerships
	business, transact any business in the Partnerships name
	or have the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the
	Partnership. Any action taken by any Affiliate of the General
	Partner or any officer, director, employee, manager, member,
	general partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any
	of its Affiliates, or any officer, director, employee, manager,
	member, general partner, agent or trustee of a Group Member, in
	its capacity as such, shall not be deemed to be participation in
	the control of the business of the Partnership by a limited
	partner of the Partnership (within the meaning of

	Section 17-303(a)

	of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act) and shall not affect,
	impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of the
	Limited Partners under this Agreement or the Delaware Limited

	relating to the Partnership, including business interests and
	activities in direct competition with the Partnership Group or
	an Affiliate of a Group Member. Neither the Partnership nor any
	of the other Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this
	Agreement in any business ventures of any Limited Partner.


	 



	Section 3.4.

	  

	Rights
	of Limited Partners

	.


	 


	(a) In addition to other rights provided by this Agreement

	entirety by the provisions below), and except as limited by
	Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), each Limited Partner shall have
	the right, for a purpose that is reasonably related to such
	Limited Partners interest as a Limited Partner in the
	Partnership, upon reasonable written demand stating the purpose
	of such demand and at such Limited Partners own expense,
	to obtain:


	 


	(i) promptly after its becoming available, a copy of the

	year (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, information specific
	to any other Partner);


	 


	(ii)  a current list of the name and last known business,

	(b) The General Partner may keep confidential from the
	Limited Partners, for such period of time as the General Partner
	determines in its sole discretion, (i) any information that
	the General Partner believes to be in the nature of trade
	secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which
	the General Partner believes (A) is not in the best
	interests of the Partnership Group, (B) could damage the
	Partnership Group or its business or (C) that any Group
	Member is required by law or by agreement with any third party
	to keep confidential (other than agreements with Affiliates of
	the Partnership the primary purpose of which is to circumvent
	the obligations set forth in this Section 3.4).


	 


	(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
	or

	Section 17-305

	of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, each of the Partners
	and each other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership
	Security hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law
	that they do not have rights to receive information from the
	Partnership or any Indemnitee for the purpose of determining
	whether to pursue litigation or assist in pending litigation
	against the Partnership or any Indemnitee

	ARTICLE IV




	 



	CERTIFICATES;
	RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS;





	REDEMPTION OF
	PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS



	 



	Section 4.1.

	  

	Certificates

	.


	 


	Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary herein,
	unless the General Partner shall determine otherwise in respect
	of some or all of any or all classes of Partnership Interests,
	Partnership Interests shall not be evidenced by certificates.
	Certificates that may be issued shall be executed on behalf of
	the Partnership by the General Partner (and by any appropriate
	officer of the General Partner on behalf of the General Partner).


	 


	No Certificate evidencing Common Units shall be valid for any
	purpose until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent;
	provided however that if the General Partner elects to issue
	Certificates evidencing Common Units in global form, the
	Certificates evidencing Common Units shall be valid upon receipt
	of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the
	Certificates evidencing Common Units have been duly registered
	in accordance with the directions of the Partnership.


	 



	Section 4.2.

	  

	Mutilated,
	Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.



	 


	(a) If any mutilated Certificate evidencing Common Units is
	surrendered to the Transfer Agent or any mutilated Certificate
	evidencing other Partnership Securities is surrendered to the
	General Partner, the appropriate officers of the General Partner
	on behalf of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership
	shall execute, and, if applicable, the Transfer Agent shall
	countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate
	evidencing the same number and type of Partnership Securities as
	the Certificate so surrendered.


	 


	(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on
	behalf of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall
	execute and deliver, and, if applicable, the Transfer Agent
	shall countersign a new Certificate in place of any Certificate
	previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:


	 


	(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance
	satisfactory to the General Partner, that a previously issued
	Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen;


	 


	(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the
	General Partner has notice that the Certificate has been
	acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without
	notice of an adverse claim;


	 


	(iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the
	General Partner a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to
	the General Partner, with surety or sureties and with fixed or
	open penalty as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may
	direct to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General
	Partner and, if applicable, the Transfer Agent against any claim
	that may be made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or
	theft of the Certificate; and


	 


	(iv) satisfies any other requirements imposed by the
	General Partner.


	 


	If a Record Holder fails to notify the General Partner within a
	reasonable period of time after he has notice of the loss,
	destruction or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the
	Limited Partner Interests represented by the Certificate is
	registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or the
	Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Record Holder
	shall be precluded from making any claim against the
	Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such
	transfer or for a new Certificate.




	A-14








	 






	(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate
	under this Section 4.2, the General Partner may require the
	payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
	governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
	any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
	Transfer Agent, if applicable) reasonably connected therewith.


	 



	Section 4.3.

	  

	Record
	Holders

	.


	 


	The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder
	as the owner with respect to any Partnership Interest and,
	accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
	other claim to or interest in such Partnership Interest on the
	part of any other Person, regardless of whether the Partnership
	shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
	required by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or
	requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such
	Partnership Interests are listed for trading. Without limiting
	the foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank,
	trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the
	foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other
	representative capacity for another Person in acquiring

	and/or

	holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the
	one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such
	representative Person shall be the Record Holder of such
	Partnership Interest.


	 



	Section 4.4.

	  

	Transfer
	Generally

	.


	 


	(a) The term transfer, when used in this
	Agreement with respect to a Partnership Interest, shall be
	deemed to refer to a transaction (i) by which the General
	Partner assigns its General Partner Units to another Person who
	becomes the General Partner, and includes a sale, assignment,
	gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange, or
	any other disposition by law or otherwise or (ii) by which
	the holder of a Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited
	Partner Interest to another Person, and includes a sale,
	assignment, gift, exchange or any other disposition by law or
	otherwise, including any transfer upon foreclosure of any
	pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.


	 


	(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole
	or in part, except in accordance with the terms and conditions
	set forth in this Article IV. Any transfer or purported
	transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance with
	this Article IV shall be null and void.


	 


	(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
	to prevent a disposition by any member of the General Partner of
	any or all of the issued and outstanding limited liability
	company or other interests in the General Partner.


	 



	Section 4.5.

	  

	Registration
	and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests

	.


	 


	(a) The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept on
	behalf of the Partnership a register in which, subject to such
	reasonable regulations as it may prescribe and subject to the
	provisions of Section 4.5(b), the Partnership will provide
	for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests.
	The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer
	agent for the purpose of registering Common Units and transfers
	of such Common Units as herein provided. The Partnership shall
	not recognize transfers of Certificates evidencing Limited
	Partner Interests unless such transfers are effected in the
	manner described in this Section 4.5. Upon surrender of a
	Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner
	Interests evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the
	provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate officers of
	the General Partner on behalf of the General Partner on behalf
	of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of
	Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver,
	in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or
	transferees, as required pursuant to the holders
	instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same
	aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was
	evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered.


	 


	(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.8, the
	Partnership shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner
	Interests evidenced by Certificates until the Certificates
	evidencing such Limited





	A-15








	 






	Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of transfer.
	No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such
	transfer; provided that as a condition to the issuance of any
	new Certificate under this Section 4.5, the General Partner
	may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
	other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect
	thereto.


	 


	(c) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this
	Section 4.5, (ii) Section 4.3,
	(iii) Section 4.4, (iv) Section 4.7,
	(v) with respect to any series of Limited Partner
	Interests, the provisions of any statement of designations or
	amendment to this Agreement establishing such series,
	(vi) any contractual provisions binding on any Limited
	Partner and (vii) provisions of applicable law including
	the Securities Act, Limited Partner Interests shall be freely
	transferable. Partnership Interests may also be subject to any
	transfer restrictions contained in any employee related policies
	or equity benefit plans, programs or practices adopted on behalf
	of the Partnership.


	 



	Section 4.6.

	  

	Transfer
	of the General Partners General Partner Interest

	.


	 


	(a) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, prior to
	December 31, 2021, the General Partner shall not transfer
	all or any part of its General Partner Interest (represented by
	General Partner Units) to a Person unless such transfer
	(i) has been approved by the prior written consent or vote
	of Limited Partners holding of at least a majority of the voting
	power of the Outstanding Voting Units (excluding Voting Units
	held by the General Partner or its Affiliates) or (ii) is
	of all, but not less than all, of its General Partner Interest
	to (A) an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an
	individual) or (B) another Person (other than an
	individual) in connection with the merger or consolidation of
	the General Partner with or into another Person (other than an
	individual) or the transfer by the General Partner of all, but
	not less than all, of its General Partner Interest to another
	Person (other than an individual).


	 


	(b) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, on or after
	December 31, 2021, the General Partner may transfer all or
	any part of its General Partner Interest without Unitholder
	approval.


	 


	(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
	transfer by the General Partner of all or any part of its
	General Partner Interest to another Person shall be permitted
	unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the rights and
	duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be
	bound by the provisions of this Agreement and (ii) the
	Partnership receives an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer
	would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited
	Partner. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance
	with this Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as the
	case may be) shall, subject to compliance with the terms of
	Section 10.3, be admitted to the Partnership as the General
	Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of such
	General Partner Interest, and the business of the Partnership
	shall continue without dissolution.


	 



	Section 4.7.

	  

	Restrictions
	on Transfers

	.


	 


	(a) Except as provided in Section 4.7(c) below, but
	notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, no
	transfer of any Partnership Interests shall be made if such
	transfer would (i) violate the then applicable
	U.S. federal or state securities laws or rules and
	regulations of the Commission, any state securities commission
	or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such
	transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of
	the Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
	formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership to be treated as
	an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed
	as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the
	extent not already so treated or taxed).


	 


	(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the
	transfer of Partnership Interests if it receives an Opinion of
	Counsel that such restrictions are necessary or advisable to
	avoid a significant risk of the Partnership becoming taxable as
	a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may
	impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement; provided
	however, that any amendment that would result in the delisting
	or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner
	Interests (unless the successor interests contemplated by
	Section 14.3(c) are traded on a National Securities
	Exchange) on the





	A-16








	 






	principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of
	Limited Partner Interests is then traded must be approved, prior
	to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a
	majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such
	class.


	 


	(c) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere
	in this Agreement, shall preclude the settlement of any
	transactions involving Partnership Interests entered into
	through the facilities of any National Securities Exchange on
	which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading.


	 



	Section 4.8.

	  

	Citizenship
	Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees.



	 


	(a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any law or
	regulation that, in the determination of the General Partner in
	its sole discretion, creates a substantial risk of cancellation
	or forfeiture of any property in which the Group Member has an
	interest based on the nationality, citizenship or other related
	status of a Limited Partner, the General Partner may request any
	Limited Partner to furnish to the General Partner, within
	30 days after receipt of such request, an executed
	Citizenship Certification or such other information concerning
	his nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the
	Limited Partner is a nominee holding for the account of another
	Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of
	such Person) as the General Partner may request. If a Limited
	Partner fails to furnish to the General Partner within the
	aforementioned

	30-day

	period such Citizenship Certification or other requested
	information or if upon receipt of such Citizenship Certification
	or other requested information the General Partner determines,
	with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner is not an
	Eligible Citizen, the Partnership Interests owned by such
	Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption in accordance
	with the provisions of Section 4.9. The General Partner
	also may require in its sole discretion that the status of any
	such Limited Partner be changed to that of a Non-citizen
	Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be
	substituted for such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner
	in respect of his Limited Partner Interests.


	 


	(b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights
	in respect of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of
	Non-citizen Assignees, distribute the votes in the same ratios
	as the votes of Partners (including the General Partner) in
	respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those of
	Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for, against or
	abstaining as to the matter.


	 


	(c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen
	Assignee shall have no right to receive a distribution in kind
	pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be entitled to the cash
	equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide cash in
	exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen Assignees
	share of the distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment
	shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the
	Partnership from the Non-citizen Assignee of his Limited Partner
	Interest (representing his right to receive his share of such
	distribution in kind).


	 


	(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has
	become an Eligible Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon
	application to the General Partner, request that with respect to
	any Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not
	redeemed pursuant to Section 4.9, such Non-citizen Assignee
	be admitted as a Limited Partner, and upon approval of the
	General Partner in its sole discretion, such Non-citizen
	Assignee shall be admitted as a Limited Partner and shall no
	longer constitute a Non-citizen Assignee and the General Partner
	shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of
	the Non-citizen Assignees Limited Partner Interests.


	 



	Section 4.9.

	  

	Redemption
	of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees.



	 


	(a) If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish a
	Citizenship Certification or other information requested within
	the

	30-day

	period specified in Section 4.8(a), or if upon receipt of
	such Citizenship Certification or other information the General
	Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited
	Partner is not an Eligible Citizen, the General Partner, in its
	sole discretion, may cause the Partnership to, unless the
	Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General
	Partner that such Limited Partner is an Eligible Citizen or has
	transferred his Partnership Interests to a Person who is an
	Eligible Citizen and who furnishes a Citizenship Certification
	to the





	A-17








	 






	General Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as
	provided below, redeem the Limited Partner Interest of such
	Limited Partner as follows:


	 


	(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the
	30th day before the date fixed for redemption, give notice
	of redemption to the Limited Partner, at his last address
	designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer
	Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The
	notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The
	notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed
	for redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the
	redemption price will be made upon the redemption of the
	Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable
	Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the
	Certificates evidencing such Redeemable Interests) and that on
	and after the date fixed for redemption no further allocations
	or distributions to which the Limited Partner would otherwise be
	entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or
	be made.


	 


	(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable
	Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market Price
	(the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for
	redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so
	redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
	of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The
	redemption price shall be paid as determined by the General
	Partner in its sole discretion, in cash or by delivery of a
	promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of
	the redemption price, bearing interest at the prime lending rate
	prevailing on the date fixed for redemption as published by

	The Wall Street Journal

	, payable in three equal annual
	installments of principal together with accrued interest,
	commencing one year after the redemption date.


	 


	(iii) The Limited Partner or his duly authorized
	representative shall be entitled to receive the payment for
	Redeemable Interests at the place of payment specified in the
	notice of redemption on the redemption date (or, if later in the
	case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon
	surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner, at the place
	specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificates,
	evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or
	accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank).


	 


	(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall
	no longer constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner
	Interests; provided however, that pursuant to Section 7.11,
	in the sole discretion of the General Partner, the Redeemable
	Interests may be held in treasury .


	 


	(b) The provisions of this Section 4.9 shall also be
	applicable to Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited
	Partner as nominee of a Person determined to be other than an
	Eligible Citizen.


	 


	(c) Nothing in this Section 4.9 shall prevent the
	recipient of a notice of redemption from transferring his
	Limited Partner Interest before the redemption date if such
	transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Upon
	receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall
	withdraw the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of
	such Limited Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of
	the General Partner in a Citizenship Certification that he is an
	Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make such
	certification, such redemption shall be effected from the
	transferee on the original redemption date.


	 


	(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.8 or
	Section 4.9 to the contrary, no proceeds shall be delivered
	to a Person to whom the delivery of such proceeds would violate
	applicable law, and in such case and in lieu thereof, the
	proceeds shall be delivered to a charity selected by the General
	Partner in its sole discretion and any redemption shall be
	effective upon delivery of such payments to such charity.

	multiplied by

	(y) the Exchange Rate (as defined in the Exchange
	Agreement).


	 


	(d) In the event that a holder of a Special Voting Unit,

	otherwise), no Partner shall have priority over any other
	Partner either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as

	Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights
	relating to Partnership Securities for any Partnership purpose
	at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such
	consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General

	designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of such
	Partnership Interest.


	 


	(c) The General Partner is hereby authorized to take all
	actions that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in
	connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership Securities
	and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating
	to Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5.6 or
	Section 7.4(c), including the admission of additional
	Limited Partners in connection therewith and any related
	amendment of this Agreement, and (ii) all additional

	A-20








	 






	the Units or other Partnership Securities or options, rights,
	warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities being so issued. The General Partner is authorized to
	do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate
	in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Securities
	or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to
	Partnership Securities, including compliance with any statute,
	rule, regulation or guideline of any governmental agency or any
	National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other
	Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities are
	listed for trading.


	 



	Section 5.7.

	  

	Preemptive
	Rights

	.


	 


	Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner, in its sole
	discretion, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or
	other similar right with respect to the issuance of any
	Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or
	hereafter created.


	 



	Section 5.8.

	  

	Splits
	and Combinations

	.


	 


	(a) Subject to Section 5.8(d), the Partnership may
	make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Securities or
	options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to
	Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a
	subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as,
	after any such event, each Partner shall have the same
	Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and
	any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number
	of Units are proportionately adjusted retroactive to the
	beginning of the Partnership.


	 


	(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or
	combination of Partnership Securities or options, rights,
	warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a
	Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or
	combination shall be effective and shall provide notice thereof
	at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record
	Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date
	of such notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of
	independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the
	number of Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities to be
	held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such
	distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner
	shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such
	firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.


	 


	(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision
	or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the
	Record Holders of Partnership Securities or options, rights,
	warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new
	number of Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities held by
	such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other
	procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to
	reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a
	smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding or
	outstanding options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights
	relating to Partnership Securities, the Partnership shall
	require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of
	any such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held
	by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.


	 


	(d) The Partnership shall not be required to issue
	fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or
	combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or
	combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional
	Units but for the provisions of this Section 5.8(d), the
	General Partner in its sole discretion may determine that each
	fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and
	a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit).


	 



	Section 5.9.

	  

	Fully
	Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests

	.


	 


	All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in
	accordance with the requirements of, this Article V shall
	be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in
	the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be
	affected by

	Sections 17-607

	or

	17-804

	of
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act or this Agreement.

	Section 6.1.

	  

	Establishment
	and Maintenance of Capital Accounts

	.


	 


	There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the
	Partnership as of the date such Partner becomes a Partner a
	capital account (each being a 

	Capital
	Account

	). Each Capital Contribution by any Partner, if
	any, shall be credited to the Capital Account of such Partner on
	the date such Capital Contribution is made to the Partnership.
	In addition, each Partners Capital Account shall be
	(a) credited with (i) such Partners allocable
	share of any Net Income (or items thereof) of the Partnership,
	and (ii) the amount of any Partnership liabilities that are
	assumed by the Partner or secured by any Partnership property
	distributed to the Partner and (b) debited with
	(i) the amount of distributions (and deemed distributions)
	to such Partner of cash or the fair market value of other
	property so distributed, (ii) such Partners allocable
	share of Net Loss (or items thereof) of the Partnership, and
	(iii) the amount of any liabilities of the Partner assumed
	by the Partnership or which are secured by any property
	contributed by the Partner to the Partnership. Any other item
	which is required to be reflected in a Partners Capital
	Account under Section 704(b) of the Code and the United
	States Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or otherwise
	under this Agreement shall be so reflected. The General Partner
	shall make such adjustments to Capital Accounts as it determines
	in its sole discretion to be appropriate to ensure allocations
	are made in accordance with a Partners interest in the
	Partnership. Interest shall not be payable on Capital Account
	balances. The Partnership Capital Accounts shall be maintained
	in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations

	Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)

	and, to the extent not inconsistent with such regulation, the
	provisions of this Agreement. The Capital Account of each holder
	of General Partner Units or Special Voting Units shall at all
	times be zero, except to the extent such holder also holds
	Partnership Interests other than General Partner Units or
	Special Voting Units.


	 



	Section 6.2.

	  

	Allocations.



	 


	(a) Net Income (Loss) (including items thereof) of the
	Partnership for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to each
	Partner in accordance with such Partners Percentage
	Interest, except as otherwise determined by the General Partner
	in its sole discretion in order to comply with the Code or
	applicable regulations thereunder.


	 


	(b) The General Partner shall determine all matters
	concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided
	for herein in its sole discretion. For the proper administration
	of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of
	Partnership Interests (or any portion or class or classes
	thereof), the General Partner may (i) amend the provisions
	of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the
	proposal or promulgation of United States Treasury Regulations
	under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or
	(y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of
	Partnership Interests (or any portion or class or classes
	thereof), and (ii) adopt and employ or modify such
	conventions and methods as the General Partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be appropriate for (A) the determination
	for tax purposes of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
	credit and the allocation of such items among Partners and
	between transferors and transferees under this Agreement and
	pursuant to the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations
	promulgated thereunder, (B) the determination of the
	identities and tax classification of Partners, (C) the
	valuation of Partnership assets and the determination of tax
	basis, (D) the allocation of asset values and tax basis,
	(E) the adoption and maintenance of accounting methods and
	(F) taking into account differences between the Carrying
	Values of Partnership assets and such asset adjusted tax basis
	pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code and the United
	States Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.


	 


	(c) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Partner
	under the provisions of this Article VI shall instead be
	made to the beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a
	nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the
	identity of such owner to the Partnership in





	A-22








	 






	accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other
	method determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion.


	 



	Section 6.3.

	  

	Requirement
	and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions to Record
	Holders

	.


	 


	(a) The General Partner, in its sole discretion, may
	authorize distributions by the Partnership to the Partners,
	which distributions shall be made Pro Rata in accordance with
	the Partners respective Percentage Interests.


	 


	(b) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the
	Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect to,
	all or less than all of the Partners, as a distribution of cash
	to such Partners.


	 


	(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of
	the dissolution of the Partnership, all receipts received during
	or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall
	be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and
	subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 12.4.


	 


	(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest
	shall be paid by the Partnership, directly or through the
	Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the
	Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of the Record Date
	set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
	payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in
	respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person
	who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an
	assignment or otherwise.


	 


	(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
	in this Agreement, the Partnership, and the General Partner on
	behalf of the Partnership, shall not be required to make a
	distribution to a Partner or a Record Holder if such
	distribution would violate the Delaware Limited Partnership Act
	or other applicable law.

	otherwise.


	 



	Section 7.2.

	  

	Certificate
	of Limited Partnership

	.


	 


	(a) The General Partner has caused the Certificate of
	Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State of
	the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Limited
	Partnership Act and is authorized to cause to be filed such
	other certificates or documents that the General Partner
	determines to be necessary or appropriate for the formation,
	continuation, qualification and operation of a limited
	partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
	limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state
	in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
	property. To the extent the General Partner determines such
	action to be necessary or appropriate, the General Partner is
	authorized to file amendments to and restatements of the
	Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain
	the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership or
	other entity in which the limited partners have limited
	liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any
	other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or
	own property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.4(a), the
	General Partner shall not be required, before or after filing,
	to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited
	Partnership, any qualification document or any amendment thereto

	partnership for U.S. federal (and applicable
	U.S. state) income tax purposes, the Partnership and each
	Partner shall agree to adjustments required by the U.S. tax
	authorities, and the Partnership shall pay such amounts as
	required by the U.S. tax authorities, to preserve the
	status of the Partnership as a partnership for U.S. federal
	(and applicable U.S. state) income tax purposes.

	Partnership
	Group Assets; General Partners Authority

	.


	 


	Except as provided in Articles XII and XIV, the General
	Partner may not sell or exchange all or substantially all of the
	assets of the Partnership Group, taken as a whole, in a single
	transaction or a





	A-25








	 






	series of related transactions without the approval of holders
	of a majority of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Units;
	provided however that this provision shall not preclude or limit
	the General Partners ability, in its sole discretion, to
	mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
	any or all of the assets of the Partnership Group (including for
	the benefit of Persons other than members of the Partnership
	Group, including Affiliates of the General Partner), including,
	in each case, pursuant to any forced sale of any or all of the
	assets of the Partnership Group pursuant to the foreclosure of,
	or other realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the
	approval of holders of a majority of the voting power of
	Outstanding Voting Units, the General Partner shall not, on
	behalf of the Partnership, except as permitted under
	Sections 4.6 and 11.1, elect or cause the Partnership to

	(a) Except as provided in this Section 7.4 and
	elsewhere in this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be
	compensated for its services as general partner or managing
	member of any Group Member.


	 


	(b) The Partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
	costs, fees, operating expenses and other expenses of the
	Partnership (including the costs, fees and expenses of
	attorneys, accountants or other professionals and the
	compensation of all personnel providing services to the
	Partnership) incurred in pursuing and conducting, or otherwise
	related to, the activities of the Partnership. The Partnership
	shall also, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, bear

	and/or

	reimburse the General Partner for (i) any costs, fees or
	expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection with
	serving as the General Partner and (ii) all other expenses
	allocable to the Partnership Group or otherwise incurred by the
	General Partner in connection with operating the Partnership
	Groups business (including expenses allocated to the
	General Partner by its Affiliates). To the extent that the
	General Partner determines in its sole discretion that such
	expenses are related to the business and affairs of the General
	Partner that are conducted through the Partnership Group
	(including expenses that relate to the business and affairs of
	the Partnership Group and that also relate to other activities
	of the General Partner), the General Partner may cause the
	Partnership to pay or bear all expenses of the General Partner,
	including without limitation, costs of securities offerings not
	borne directly by Partners, board of directors compensation and

	litigation costs and damages arising from litigation, accounting
	and legal costs and franchise taxes, provided that the
	Partnership shall not pay or bear any income tax obligations of
	the General Partner. Reimbursements pursuant to this
	Section 7.4 shall be in addition to any reimbursement to
	the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant to
	Section 7.7.


	 


	(c) The General Partner may, in its sole discretion,
	without the approval of the Limited Partners (who shall have no
	right to vote in respect thereof), propose and adopt on behalf
	of the Partnership Group equity benefit plans, programs and
	practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
	issuance of or reservation of issuance of Partnership Securities
	or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to
	Partnership Securities), or cause the Partnership to issue or to
	reserve for issuance Partnership Securities or options, rights,
	warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities in connection with, or pursuant to, any such equity
	benefit plan, program or practice or any equity benefit plan,
	program or practice maintained or sponsored by the General
	Partner or any of its Affiliates in respect of services
	performed directly or indirectly for the benefit of the
	Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to
	the General Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership
	Securities or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights
	relating to Partnership Securities that the General Partner or
	such Affiliates are obligated to provide pursuant to any equity
	benefit plans, programs or practices maintained or sponsored by
	them. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection
	with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net
	cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership
	Securities or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights
	relating to Partnership Securities purchased by the





	A-26








	 






	General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to
	fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and
	practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with
	Section 7.4(b). Any and all obligations of the General
	Partner under any equity benefit plans, programs or practices
	adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this
	Section 7.4(c) shall constitute obligations of the General
	Partner hereunder and shall be assumed by any successor General
	Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or the transferee
	of or successor to all of the General Partners General
	Partner Interest.


	 



	Section 7.5.

	  

	Outside
	Activities

	.


	 


	(a) On and after the Listing Date, the General Partner, for
	so long as it is a General Partner of the Partnership
	(i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a
	general partner or managing member of the Partnership and any
	other partnership or limited liability company of which the
	Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner, managing
	member, trustee or stockholder and to undertake activities that
	are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited
	partner in the Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in
	any business or activity or incur any debts or liabilities
	except in connection with or incidental to (A) its
	performance as general partner, managing member, trustee or
	stockholder of one or more Group Members or as described in or
	contemplated by the Registration Statement or (B) the
	acquiring, owning or disposing of debt or equity securities in

	(b) Except insofar as the General Partner is specifically
	restricted by Section 7.5(a), each Indemnitee shall have
	the right to engage in businesses of every type and description
	and other activities for profit and to engage in and possess an
	interest in other business ventures of any and every type or
	description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to
	be engaged in by any Group Member, independently or with others,
	including business interests and activities in direct
	competition with the business and activities of any Group
	Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach of this
	Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
	otherwise to any Group Member or any Partner, Record Holder or
	Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Security. None
	of any Group Member, any Limited Partner or any other Person
	shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the
	partnership relationship established hereby in any business
	ventures of any Indemnitee.


	 


	(c) Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(a) and
	Section 7.5(b), but otherwise notwithstanding anything to
	the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engagement in
	competitive activities by any Indemnitees (other than the
	General Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this
	Section 7.5 is hereby approved by the Partnership, all
	Partners and all Persons acquiring an interest in a Partnership
	Security, (ii) it shall not be a breach of the General
	Partners or any other Indemnitees duties or any
	other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner
	or any other Indemnitee if the Indemnitee (other than the
	General Partner) engages in any such business interests or
	activities in preference to or to the exclusion of any Group
	Member, (iii) the General Partner and the Indemnities shall
	have no obligation hereunder or as a result of any duty
	otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise to present
	business opportunities to any Group Member, (iv) the
	doctrine of corporate opportunity or other analogous
	doctrine shall not apply to any such Indemnitee and (v) the
	Indemnitees (including the General Partner) shall not be liable
	to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, Record Holder or any
	other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Security
	by reason that such Indemnitee or Indemnitees (including the
	General Partner) pursues or acquires a business opportunity for
	itself, directs such opportunity to another Person, does not
	communicate such opportunity or information to any Group Member
	or uses information in the possession of a Group Member to
	acquire or operate a business opportunity.


	 


	(d) The General Partner and any of its Affiliates may
	acquire Units or other Partnership Securities or options,
	rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
	Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a General
	Partner or Limited Partner, as applicable, relating to such
	Units or Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities.

	from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
	Partnership; Contracts with the General Partner and its
	Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the General Partner

	.

	or contribute to any other Group Member, and any Group Member
	may borrow from any other Group Member (including the
	Partnership), funds on terms and conditions determined by the
	General Partner in its sole discretion. The foregoing authority
	may be exercised by the General Partner in its sole discretion
	and shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Group
	Member or any other Person.


	 


	(c) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an
	agreement with any of its Affiliates to, render services to a
	Group Member or to the General Partner in the discharge of its
	duties as general partner of the Partnership on terms to which
	the General Partner agrees to in good faith.


	 


	(d) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures,

	from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly, on terms to which

	to enter into such contracts.


	 



	Section 7.7.

	  

	Indemnification

	.


	 


	(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to
	the limitations expressly provided in this Section 7.7, all
	Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
	Partnership on an after tax basis from and against any and all
	losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
	(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
	penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from
	any and all threatened, pending or completed claims, demands,
	actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
	administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal
	and including appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved,
	or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by
	reason of its status as an Indemnitee whether arising from acts
	or omissions to act occurring on, before or after the date of
	this Agreement; provided that the Indemnitee shall not be
	indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final and
	non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent
	jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for
	which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this
	Section 7.7, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged
	in fraud or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding the preceding
	sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.7(j),
	the Partnership shall be required to indemnify a Person
	described in such sentence in connection with any claim, demand,
	action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such
	Person only if (x) the commencement of such claim, demand,
	action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by such Person was
	authorized by the General Partner in its sole discretion or
	(y) there has been a final and non-appealable judgment
	entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that
	such Person was entitled to indemnification by the Partnership
	pursuant to Section 7.7(j). The indemnification of an
	Indemnitee of the type identified in clause (d) of the
	definition of Indemnitee shall be secondary to any and all
	indemnification to which such person is entitled from, firstly,
	the relevant other Person, and from, secondly, the relevant Fund
	(if applicable), and will only be paid to the extent the primary
	indemnification is not paid and the proviso set forth in the
	first sentence of this Section 7.7(a) does not apply;
	provided that such other





	A-28








	 






	Person and such Fund shall not be entitled to contribution or
	indemnification from or subrogation against the Partnership,
	unless otherwise mandated by applicable law. If, notwithstanding
	the foregoing sentence, the Partnership makes an indemnification
	payment or advances expenses to such an Indemnitee entitled to
	primary indemnification, the Partnership shall be subrogated to
	the rights of such Indemnitee against the Person or Persons
	responsible for the primary indemnification. Fund
	means any fund, investment vehicle or account whose investments
	are managed or advised by the Partnership (if any) or an
	affiliate thereof.


	 


	(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses
	(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee
	who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.7(a) in appearing
	at, participating in or defending any claim, demand, action,
	suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the
	Partnership prior to a final and non-appealable determination
	that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon
	receipt by the Partnership of an undertaking by or on behalf of
	the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it ultimately shall be
	determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
	as authorized in this Section 7.7. Notwithstanding the
	preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in
	Section 7.7(j), the Partnership shall be required to
	indemnify a Person described in such sentence in connection with
	any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof)
	commenced by such Person only if (x) the commencement of
	such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof)
	by such Person was authorized by the General Partner in its sole
	discretion or (y) there has been a final and non-appealable
	judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
	determining that such Person was entitled to indemnification by
	the Partnership pursuant to Section 7.7(j).


	 


	(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7
	shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee
	may be entitled under any agreement, insurance, pursuant to any
	vote of the holders of Outstanding Voting Units entitled to vote
	on such matter, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both
	as to actions in the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee
	and as to actions in any other capacity (including any capacity
	under the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an
	Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity.


	 


	(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse
	the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of)
	insurance, on behalf of the General Partner, its Affiliates, the
	other Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner
	shall determine in its sole discretion, against any liability
	that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred
	by, such Person in connection with the Partnership Groups
	activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the
	Partnership Group regardless of whether the Partnership would
	have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability
	under the provisions of this Agreement.


	 


	(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, (i) the
	Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to
	serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the
	performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
	duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
	participants or beneficiaries of the plan; (ii) excise
	taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee
	benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute
	fines within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and
	(iii) any action taken or omitted by an Indemnitee with
	respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its
	duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best
	interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall
	be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of
	the Partnership.


	 


	(f) Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7
	shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership. The
	General Partner shall not be personally liable for such
	indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or
	loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to
	effectuate such indemnification. Except as required by Section
	17-607 and Section 17-804 of the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act, in no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners
	to personal liability by reason of the indemnification
	provisions set forth in this Agreement.




	A-29








	 






	(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in
	whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the
	Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to
	which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
	otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.


	 


	(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the
	benefit of the Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns,
	executors and administrators and shall not be deemed to create
	any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.


	 


	(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this
	Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall in any manner
	terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or
	future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the
	obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee
	under and in accordance with the provisions of this
	Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such
	amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
	from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or-in part,
	prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of
	when such claims may arise or be asserted.


	 


	(j) If a claim for indemnification (following the final
	disposition of the action, suit or proceeding for which
	indemnification is being sought) or advancement of expenses
	under this Section 7.7 is not paid in full within thirty
	(30) days after a written claim therefor by any Indemnitee
	has been received by the Partnership, such Indemnitee may file
	suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if
	successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the
	expenses of prosecuting such claim, including reasonable
	attorneys fees. In any such action the Partnership shall
	have the burden of proving that such Indemnitee is not entitled
	to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses
	under applicable law.


	 


	(k) This Section 7.7 shall not limit the right of the
	Partnership, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law,
	to indemnify and to advance expenses to, and purchase and
	maintain insurance on behalf of, Persons other than Indemnitees.


	 



	Section 7.8.

	  

	Liability
	of Indemnitees

	.


	 


	(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
	this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable to the
	Partnership, the Limited Partners or any other Persons who have
	acquired interests in the Partnership Securities or are bound by
	this Agreement, for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
	joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses),
	judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
	amounts arising as a result of any act or omission of an
	Indemnitee, or for any breach of contract (including breach of
	this Agreement) or any breach of duties (including breach of
	fiduciary duties) whether arising hereunder, at law, in equity
	or otherwise, unless there has been a final and non-appealable
	judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
	determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the
	Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful
	misconduct. The Partnership, the Limited Partners, the Record
	Holders and any other Person who acquires an interest in a
	Partnership Security, each on their own behalf and on behalf of
	the Partnership, waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
	any and all rights to seek punitive damages or damages based
	upon any Federal, State or other income (or similar) taxes paid
	or payable by any such Limited Partner, Record Holder or other
	Person.


	 


	(b) The General Partner may exercise any of the powers
	granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties
	imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its
	agents, and the General Partner shall not be responsible for any
	misconduct, negligence or wrongdoing on the part of any such
	agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith.


	 


	(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee
	has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating
	thereto to the Partnership, the Partners, the Record Holders or
	any Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Security,
	any Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnerships
	business or affairs shall not be liable, to the fullest extent
	permitted by law, to the Partnership, to any Partner, to any
	Record Holder or to any other Person who acquires an interest in
	a Partnership Security for such Indemnitees reliance on
	the provisions of this Agreement.

	(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this
	Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be prospective
	only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the
	liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as in
	effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or
	repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
	matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment,
	modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise
	or be asserted, and provided such Person became an Indemnitee
	hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.


	 



	Section

	 7.9.  

	Modification
	of Duties; Standards of Conduct; Resolution of Conflicts of
	Interest



	 


	(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
	this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision of law or in
	equity, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee
	shall have any fiduciary duties, or, to the fullest extent
	permitted by law, except to the extent expressly provided in
	this Agreement, other duties, obligations or liabilities, to the
	Partnership, any Limited Partner, any other Person who has
	acquired an interest in a Partnership Security, any other Person
	who is bound by this Agreement or any creditor of the
	Partnership, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
	General Partner and the other Indemnitees shall only be subject
	to any contractual standards imposed and existing under this
	Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
	or otherwise applicable provision of law or in equity, whenever
	in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby the
	General Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee of the
	Board of Directors is permitted to or required to make a
	decision (i) in its discretion or sole
	discretion or (ii) pursuant to any provision not
	subject to an express standard of good faith
	(regardless of whether there is a reference to
	discretion, sole discretion or any other
	standard), then the General Partner (or any of its Affiliates or
	Associates causing it to do so), the Board of Directors, or any
	committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, in making
	such decision, shall not be subject to any fiduciary duty and
	shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as
	it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty
	or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration
	to any interest of or factors affecting the Partnership, the
	Partners, or any other Person (including any creditor of the
	Partnership), and shall not be subject to any other or different
	standards imposed by this Agreement or otherwise existing at
	law, in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the immediately
	preceding sentence, if a decision or action under this Agreement
	is to be made or taken by the General Partner in good
	faith, the General Partner shall act under that express
	standard and shall not be subject to any other or different
	standard under this Agreement or otherwise existing at law, in
	equity or otherwise. For all purposes of this Agreement and
	notwithstanding any applicable provision of law or in equity, a
	determination or other action or failure to act by the General
	Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
	conclusively will be deemed to be made, taken or omitted to be
	made or taken in good faith, and shall not be a
	breach of this Agreement, (i) if such determination, action
	or failure to act was approved by Special Approval or
	(ii) unless the General Partner, the Board of Directors or
	committee thereof, as applicable, subjectively believed such
	determination, action or failure to act was opposed to the best
	interests of the Partnership. The belief of a majority of the
	Board of Directors or committee thereof shall be deemed to be
	the belief of the Board of Directors or such committee. In any
	proceeding brought by the Partnership, any Limited Partner, any
	Record Holder, any other Person who acquires an interest in a
	Partnership Security or any other Person who is bound by this
	Agreement challenging such action, determination or failure to
	act, notwithstanding any provision of law or equity to the
	contrary, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding
	shall have the burden of proving that such determination, action
	or failure to act was not in good faith. Any action or
	determination taken or made by the General Partner, its Board of
	Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors (including
	the Conflicts Committee) or any other Indemnitee which is not in
	breach of this Agreement shall be deemed taken or determined in
	compliance with this Agreement, the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act and any other applicable fiduciary requirements.




	A-31








	 






	(b) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or
	takes or fails to take any other action, or any of its
	Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as
	opposed to in its capacity as a general partner of the
	Partnership, whether under this Agreement or any other agreement
	or circumstance contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the
	General Partner, or such Affiliates or Associates causing it to
	do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
	make such determination or to take or not to take such other
	action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) existing
	at law, in equity or otherwise or obligation whatsoever to the
	Partnership, any Limited Partner, any Record Holder, any Person
	who acquires an interest in a Partnership Security, any other
	Person bound by this Agreement or any creditor of the
	Partnership, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing
	it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
	be required to act pursuant to any other standard imposed by
	this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act or any other law, rule or
	regulation or at equity.


	 


	(c) Whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or
	arises between the General Partner (in its capacity as the
	general partner of the Partnership, as limited partner of the
	Partnership, or in its individual capacity) or any of its
	Affiliates or Associates, on the one hand, and the Partnership,
	any Group Member, any Partner, any other Person who acquires an
	interest in a Partnership Security or any other Person who is
	bound by this Agreement, on the other, any resolution or course
	of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of
	such conflict of interest shall conclusively be deemed approved
	by the Partnership, all of the Partners, each Person who
	acquires an interest in a Partnership Security and any other
	Person bound hereby and shall not constitute a breach of this
	Agreement or any agreement contemplated herein, or of duty
	(including any fiduciary duty) existing at law, in equity or
	otherwise or obligation whatsoever if the resolution or course
	of action in respect of such conflict of interest is
	(i) approved by Special Approval or (ii) approved by
	the General Partner in good faith. The General Partner and the
	Conflicts Committee (in connection with any Special Approval by
	the Conflicts Committee) each shall be authorized in connection
	with its resolution of any conflict of interest to consider such
	factors as it determines in its sole discretion to be relevant,
	reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances. The General
	Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with
	its resolution of any conflict of interest to seek Special
	Approval of such resolution, and the General Partner may also
	adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received
	Special Approval. Failure to seek Special Approval shall not be
	deemed to indicate that a conflict of interest exists or that
	Special Approval could not have been obtained. Notwithstanding
	anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise
	existing at law or equity, and without limitation of
	Section 7.6, to the fullest extent permitted by the
	Delaware Limited Partnership Act, the existence of the conflicts
	of interest described in or contemplated by the Registration
	Statement are hereby approved, and all such conflicts of
	interest are waived, by the Partnership and each Partner and any
	other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Security
	and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any duty
	existing at law, in equity or otherwise.


	 


	(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
	Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates shall have no
	duty or obligation, express or implied, to (i) sell or
	otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other
	than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any
	Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General
	Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in
	contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing
	with such use. Any determination by the General Partner or any
	of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be in its
	sole discretion.


	 


	(e) The Limited Partners, hereby authorize the General
	Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a partner or member of
	a Group Member, to approve of actions by the general partner or
	managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions
	permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this
	Section 7.9.




	A-32








	 






	 


	(f) The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the
	General Partner is under no obligation to consider the separate
	interests of the Limited Partners (including, without
	limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners) in
	deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to
	take) any actions, and that the General Partner shall not be
	liable to the Limited Partners for monetary damages or equitable
	relief for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits
	not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such
	decisions.


	 


	(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	to the extent that any provision of this Agreement, including
	the provisions of this Section 7.9, purports (i) to
	restrict or otherwise modify or eliminate the duties (including
	fiduciary duties), obligations and liabilities of the General
	Partner, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of
	Directors (including the Conflicts Committee) or any other
	Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity or
	(ii) to constitute a waiver or consent by the Partnership,
	the Limited Partners or any other Person who acquires an
	interest in a Partnership Security to any such restriction,
	modification or elimination, such provision shall be deemed to
	have been approved by the Partnership, all of the Partners, and
	each other Person who has acquired an interest in a Partnership
	Security.


	 



	Section

	 7.10.  

	Other
	Matters Concerning the General Partner

	.


	 


	(a) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely
	and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon
	any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
	report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or
	other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have
	been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.


	 


	(b) The General Partner and any Indemnitee may consult with
	legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants,
	investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected
	by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon
	the advice or opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such
	Persons as to matters that the General Partner or such
	Indemnitee believes to be within such Persons professional
	or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been
	done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such advice
	or opinion.


	 


	(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of
	any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any
	of its duly authorized officers or any duly appointed attorney
	or attorneys-in-fact. Each such attorney shall, to the extent
	provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney, have
	full power and authority to do and perform each and every act
	and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the General
	Partner hereunder.


	 



	Section

	 7.11.  

	Purchase
	or Sale of Partnership Securities.



	 


	The General Partner may cause the Partnership or any other Group
	Member to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Securities
	or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to
	Partnership Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of
	this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision of law or
	equity, any Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants
	or appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities that
	are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Partnership may, in
	the sole discretion of the General Partner, be held by the
	Partnership in treasury and, if so held in treasury, shall no
	longer be deemed to be Outstanding for any purpose. For the
	avoidance of doubt, (i) Partnership Securities or options,
	rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities that are held by the Partnership in treasury
	(a) shall not be allocated Net Income (Loss) pursuant to
	Article VI and (b) shall not be entitled to
	distributions pursuant to Article VI, and (ii) shall
	neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes.
	The General Partner or any other Indemnitee or any Affiliate of
	the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and
	sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities or options,
	rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership
	Securities for their own account, subject to the provisions of
	Articles IV and X.

	Section

	 7.12.  

	Reliance
	by Third Parties.



	 


	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
	Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume
	that the General Partner and any officer of the General Partner
	purporting to act on behalf of and in the name of the
	Partnership has full power and authority to encumber, sell or
	otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the
	Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf
	of the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal
	with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were the
	Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally and
	beneficially. The Partnership, each Limited Partner and each
	other Person who has acquired an interest in a Partnership
	Security hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies
	that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
	disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such officer
	in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any
	Person dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or
	its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of
	this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the
	necessity or expedience of any act or action of the General
	Partner or any such officer. Each and every certificate,
	document or other instrument executed on behalf of the
	Partnership by the General Partner or any such officer shall be
	conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying
	thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the
	execution and delivery of such certificate, document or
	instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect,
	(b) the General Partner or any such officer executing and
	delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly
	authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
	Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or
	instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with
	the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon
	the Partnership.


	 



	Section 

	7.13.  

	Board
	of Directors



	 


	(a) On January 31 of each year (each a Determination
	Date), the General Partner will determine whether the
	voting power collectively held by (i) the holders of
	Special Voting Units (including Voting Units held by the General
	Partner and its Affiliates) in their capacity as such,
	(ii) persons that were formerly employed by or had provided
	services to (including as a director), or are then employed by
	or providing services to (including as a director), the General
	Partner

	and/or

	its
	Affiliates, and (iii) any estate, trust, partnership or
	limited liability company or other similar entity of which any
	such person is a trustee, partner, member or similar party,
	respectively, is at least 10% of the voting power of the
	Outstanding Voting Units (treating as Outstanding and held by
	any such persons, Voting Units deliverable pursuant to any
	equity awards granted to such persons) (the Carlyle
	Partners Ownership Condition).


	 


	(b) The method of nomination, election and removal of
	Directors shall be determined as follows: (i) in any year
	in which the General Partner has determined on the applicable
	Determination Date that the Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition
	has not been satisfied, the Board of Directors shall be elected
	at an annual meeting of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding
	Units in accordance with Section 13.4(b); and (ii) in
	any year in which the General Partner has determined on the
	applicable Determination Date that the Carlyle Partners
	Ownership Condition has been satisfied, the provisions of
	Section 13.4(b) shall not apply and the method for
	nominating, electing and removing Directors shall be as
	otherwise provided in the General Partner Agreement.

	As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each Fiscal
	Year (which each of the Partners and each other Person who
	acquires an interest in a Partnership Security hereby
	acknowledges and agrees may be later than the otherwise
	applicable due date of the tax return of such Partner or other
	Person), the Partnership shall send to each Partner a copy of
	U.S. Internal Revenue Service

	provide the Partners with such other information as may be
	reasonably required in the discretion of the General Partner for
	purposes of allowing the Partners to prepare and file their own
	U.S. federal, state and local tax returns. Each Partner

	The General Partner shall determine whether to make, refrain
	from making or revoke any and all elections permitted by the tax

	Section

	 9.3.  

	Tax
	Controversies.



	 


	Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner is
	designated as the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in the Code)
	and is authorized to represent the Partnership (at the
	Partnerships expense) in connection with all examinations
	of the Partnerships affairs by tax authorities, including
	resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and to expend
	Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated
	therewith. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General
	Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
	required by the General Partner to conduct such proceedings.


	 



	Section

	 9.4.  

	Withholding.



	 


	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
	General Partner is authorized to take any action that may be
	required or be necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership
	or any other Group Member to comply with any withholding
	requirements established under the Code or any other
	U.S. federal, state, local or

	non-U.S. law

	including pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and
	3406 of the Code. To the extent that the Partnership is required
	or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any
	amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income
	to any Partner (including by reason of Section 1446 of the
	Code), the General Partner shall treat the





	A-35








	 






	amount withheld as a distribution of cash pursuant to
	Section 6.3 in the amount of such withholding from such
	Partner.


	 



	Section

	 9.5.

	to be Treated as a Corporation.



	If the General Partner determines in its sole discretion that it
	is no longer in the interests of the Partnership to continue as
	a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
	General Partner may elect to treat the Partnership as an
	association or as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
	corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income
	tax purposes or may effect such change by merger or conversion
	or otherwise under applicable law.

	occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of
	Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall result in
	the withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership.


	 


	(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership
	upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall not
	constitute a breach of this Agreement under the following
	circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning
	on the Listing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, New York City
	time, on December 31, 2021, the General Partner voluntarily
	withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance notice
	of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners; provided
	that prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, the
	withdrawal is approved by Limited Partners holding at least a
	majority of the voting power of the Outstanding Voting Units
	(excluding Voting Units held by the General Partner and its
	Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership
	an Opinion of Counsel (

	Withdrawal Opinion of
	Counsel

	) that such withdrawal (following the selection
	of the successor General Partner) would not result in the loss
	of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or cause the
	Partnership or any Group Member to be treated as an association
	taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not
	previously treated as such); (ii) at any time after 12:00
	midnight, New York City time, on December 31, 2021, the
	General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least
	90 days advance notice to the Unitholders, such
	withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such notice;
	(iii) at any time that the General Partner ceases to be the
	General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii); or
	(iv) notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at
	any time that the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by
	giving at least 90 days advance notice of its
	intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal
	to take effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the
	time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other
	than the General Partner and its Affiliates) Beneficially Own or
	own of record or control at least 50% of the Outstanding Common
	Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the
	Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall
	also constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general
	partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the
	other Group Members. If the General Partner gives a notice of
	withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), the Limited
	Partners holding of a majority of the voting power of
	Outstanding Voting Units, may, prior to the effective date of
	such withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person
	so elected as successor General Partner shall automatically
	become the successor general partner or managing member, to the
	extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the
	General Partner is a general partner or a managing member, and
	is hereby authorized to, and shall, continue the business of the
	Partnership and, to the extent applicable, the other Group
	Members without dissolution. If, prior to the effective date of
	the General Partners withdrawal pursuant to
	Section 11.1(a)(i), a successor is not selected by the
	Unitholders as provided herein or the Partnership does not
	receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall
	be dissolved in accordance with and subject to
	Section 12.1. Any successor General Partner elected in
	accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be
	subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.


	 



	Section

	 11.2.  

	No
	Removal of the General Partner.



	 


	The Limited Partners shall have no right to remove or expel,
	with or without cause, the General Partner.


	 



	Section

	 11.3.  

	Interest
	of Departing General Partner and Successor General Partner

	.


	 


	(a) In the event of the withdrawal of a General Partner, if
	a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the
	terms of Section 11.1, the Departing General Partner, in
	its sole discretion and acting in its individual capacity, shall
	have the option exercisable prior to the effective date of the
	withdrawal of such Departing General Partner to require its
	successor to purchase its General





	A-38








	 






	Partner Interest (represented by General Partner Units) in
	exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of
	such General Partner Interest, such amount to be determined and
	payable as of the effective date of its withdrawal. The
	Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all
	reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to
	Section 7.4, including any employee-related liabilities
	(including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with
	the termination of any employees employed by the Departing
	General Partner or its Affiliates (excluding any Group Member)
	for the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members.


	 


	For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value
	of a Departing General Partners General Partner Interest
	shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General
	Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within
	30 days after the effective date of such Departing General
	Partners departure, by an independent investment banking
	firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing
	General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on
	other experts, and the determination of which shall be
	conclusive as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon
	one independent investment banking firm or other independent
	expert within 45 days after the effective date of such
	departure, then the Departing General Partner shall designate an
	independent investment banking firm or other independent expert,
	the Departing General Partners successor shall designate
	an independent investment banking firm or other independent
	expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third
	independent investment banking firm or independent expert, which
	third independent investment banking firm or other independent
	expert shall determine the fair market value of the General
	Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner. In making its
	determination, such third independent investment banking firm or
	other independent expert may consider the then current trading
	price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on which
	Common Units are then listed, the value of the
	Partnerships assets, the rights and obligations of the
	Departing General Partner and other factors it may deem relevant.


	 


	(b) If the Departing General Partner does not exercise its
	option to require the successor General Partner to purchase its
	General Partner Interest in the manner set forth in
	Section 11.3(a), the Departing General Partner (or its
	transferee) shall automatically become a Limited Partner and its
	General Partner Interest automatically shall be converted into
	Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment
	banking firm or other independent expert selected pursuant to
	Section 11.3(a). Any successor General Partner shall
	indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as
	to all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or
	after the date on which the Departing General Partner (or its
	transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this
	Agreement, conversion of the General Partner Interest of the
	Departing General Partner to Common Units will be characterized
	as if the Departing General Partner (or its transferee)
	contributed its General Partner Interest to the Partnership in
	exchange for the newly-issued Common Units and the Partnership
	reissued a new General Partner Interest in the Partnership to
	the successor General Partner.


	 



	Section

	 11.4.  

	Withdrawal
	of Limited Partners.



	 


	No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the
	Partnership; provided however that when a transferee of a
	Limited Partners Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record
	Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such
	transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner
	with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

	General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
	Upon the withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor

	A-39








	 






	pursuant to Sections 10.3, 11.1 or 12.2, the Partnership
	shall not be dissolved and such successor General Partner is
	hereby authorized to, and shall, continue the business of the
	Partnership. Subject to Section 12.2, the Partnership shall
	dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon:


	 


	(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as
	provided in Section 11.1(a) (other than
	Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and
	such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to this
	Agreement;


	 


	(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General
	Partner that is approved by the Unitholders holding a majority
	of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Units;


	 


	(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the
	Partnership pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Limited
	Partnership Act; or


	 


	(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the
	Partnership is continued without dissolution in accordance with
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act.


	 



	Section

	 12.2.  

	Continuation
	of the Business of the Partnership After Event of Withdrawal.



	 


	Upon an Event of Withdrawal caused by (a) the withdrawal of
	the General Partner as provided in Sections 11.1(a)(i) and
	the failure of the Partners to select a successor to such
	Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1, then
	within 90 days thereafter, or (b) an event
	constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
	Sections 11.1(a)(iii), (iv) or (v), then, to the
	maximum extent permitted by law, within 180 days
	thereafter, the Unitholders holding a majority of the voting
	power of Outstanding Voting Units may elect to continue the
	business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set
	forth in this Agreement by appointing as the successor General
	Partner a Person approved by the Unitholders holding a majority
	of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Units. Unless such an
	election is made within the applicable time period as set forth
	above, the Partnership shall dissolve and conduct only
	activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election
	is so made, then:


	 


	(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution
	unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this
	Article XII;


	 


	(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former
	General Partner, then the interest of the former General Partner
	shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 11.3; and


	 


	(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to
	the Partnership as General Partner, effective as of the Event of
	Withdrawal, by agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement;


	 


	provided that the right of the Unitholders holding a majority of
	the voting power of Outstanding Voting Units to approve a
	successor General Partner and to continue the business of the
	Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the
	Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel (x) that the
	exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited
	liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the
	Partnership nor any Group Member (other than the Carlyle
	Holdings I General Partner, Carlyle Holdings III General
	Partner or other Group Member that is formed or existing as a
	corporation) would be treated as an association taxable as a
	corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such
	right to continue (to the extent not so treated or taxed).


	 



	Section

	 12.3.  

	Liquidator.



	 


	Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is
	continued pursuant to Section 12.2, the General Partner
	shall act, or select in its sole discretion one or more Persons
	to act as Liquidator. If the General Partner is acting as the
	Liquidator, it shall not be entitled to receive any additional
	compensation for acting in such capacity. If a Person other than
	the General Partner acts as Liquidator, such Liquidator
	(1) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its
	services as may be approved by either the Board of Directors of
	the withdrawing General Partner (or similar governing body) or
	Unitholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of
	the Outstanding





	A-40








	 






	Voting Units voting as a single class, (2) shall agree not
	to resign at any time without 15 days prior notice
	and (3) may be removed at any time, with or without cause,
	by notice of removal approved by Unitholders holding at least a
	majority of the voting power of the Outstanding Voting Units
	voting as a single class. Upon dissolution, removal or
	resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute
	Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and
	duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days
	thereafter be approved by holders of at least a majority of the
	voting power of the Outstanding Voting Units voting as a single
	class. The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator
	in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to
	any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the
	manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this
	Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided
	herein shall have and may exercise, without further
	authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of
	the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of
	this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable
	limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of
	such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in
	Section 7.3) necessary or appropriate to carry out the
	duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during
	the period of time required to complete the winding up and
	liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.


	 



	Section

	 12.4.  

	Liquidation.



	 


	The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the
	Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up
	its affairs in such manner and over such period as the
	Liquidator determines to be in the best interest of the
	Partners, subject to

	Section 17-804

	of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the following:


	 


	(a) 

	Disposition of Assets.

	  The assets may
	be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in
	kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and
	such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is
	distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be
	deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received
	cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously
	therewith, appropriate distributions of cash (to the extent any
	cash is available) must be made to the other Partners. The
	Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the
	Partnerships assets for a reasonable time if it determines
	that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the
	Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause
	undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the
	Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
	determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue
	loss to the Partners.


	 


	(b) 

	Discharge of Liabilities.

	  Liabilities
	of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
	compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms
	of Section 12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in
	respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With
	respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or
	unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the
	Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it
	thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other
	assets to provide for its payment.


	 


	(c) 

	Liquidation Distributions.

	  All cash
	and other property in excess of that required to discharge
	liabilities (whether by payment or the making of reasonable
	provision for payment thereof) as provided in
	Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the Partners in
	accordance with their respective Percentage Interests as of a
	Record Date selected by the Liquidator.


	 



	Section

	 12.5.  

	Cancellation
	of Certificate of Limited Partnership.



	 


	Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and
	other property as provided in Section 12.4 in connection
	with the liquidation of the Partnership, the Certificate of
	Limited Partnership shall be cancelled in accordance with the
	Delaware Limited Partnership Act and all qualifications of the
	Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions
	other than the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such
	other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership
	shall be taken.

	shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or
	property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the
	return of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or
	Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
	understood that any such return shall be made solely from

	to be Adopted Solely by the General Partner.



	 


	Each Partner agrees that the General Partner, without the
	approval of any Partner, any Unitholder or any other Person, may
	amend any provision of this Agreement and execute, swear to,
	acknowledge, deliver, file and record whatever documents may be
	required in connection therewith, to reflect:


	 


	(a) a change in the name of the Partnership, the location
	of the principal place of business of the Partnership, the
	registered agent of the Partnership or the registered office of
	the Partnership;


	 


	(b) the admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of
	Partners in accordance with this Agreement;


	 


	(c) a change that the General Partner determines in its
	sole discretion is necessary or appropriate to qualify or
	continue the qualification of the Partnership as a limited
	partnership or a partnership in which the Limited Partners have
	limited liability under the laws of any state or other
	jurisdiction or to ensure that the Group Members (other than the
	Carlyle Holdings I General Partner or the Carlyle
	Holdings III General Partner or other Group Member that is
	formed or existing as a corporation) will not be treated as
	associations taxable as corporations or otherwise taxed as
	entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the
	extent not so treated);


	 


	(d) a change that the General Partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate to address
	changes in U.S. federal, state or local income tax
	regulations, legislation or interpretation;


	 


	(e) a change that the General Partner determines
	(i) does not adversely affect the Limited Partners
	considered as a whole (or adversely affect any particular class
	of Partnership Interests as compared to another class of
	Partnership Interests, except under clause (h) below) in
	any material respect; provided, however, for purposes of
	determining whether an amendment satisfies the requirements of
	this Section 13.1(e)(i), the General Partner may in its
	sole discretion disregard any adverse effect on any class or
	classes of Partnership Interests the holders of which have
	approved such amendment pursuant to
	Section 13.3(c)(ii) to be necessary or appropriate to
	(A) satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines
	contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation
	of any U.S. federal, state or local or

	non-U.S. agency

	or judicial authority or contained in any U.S. federal,
	state or local or

	non-U.S. statute

	(including the Delaware Limited Partnership Act) or
	(B) facilitate the trading of the Limited Partner Interests
	(including the division of any class or classes of Outstanding
	Limited Partner Interests into different classes to





	A-42








	 






	facilitate uniformity of tax consequences within such classes of
	Limited Partner Interests) or comply with any rule, regulation,
	guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
	which the Limited Partner Interests are or will be listed,
	(iii) to be necessary or appropriate in connection with
	action taken by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.8
	or (iv) is required to effect the intent expressed in the
	Registration Statement or the intent of the provisions of this
	Agreement or is otherwise contemplated by this Agreement;


	 


	(f) a change in the Fiscal Year or taxable year of the
	Partnership and any other changes that the General Partner
	determines to be necessary or appropriate as a result of a
	change in the Fiscal Year or taxable year of the Partnership
	including, if the General Partner shall so determine in its sole
	discretion, a change in the definition of
	

	Quarter

	 and the dates on which distributions
	are to be made by the Partnership;


	 


	(g) an amendment that is necessary, in the Opinion of
	Counsel, to prevent the Partnership, or the General Partner or
	its Indemnitees, from having a material risk of being in any
	manner subjected to registration under the provisions of the
	U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the
	U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or
	plan asset regulations adopted under the
	U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
	amended, regardless of whether such are substantially similar to
	plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed by the
	United States Department of Labor;


	 


	(h) an amendment that the General Partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate in connection
	with the creation, authorization or issuance of any class or
	series of Partnership Securities or options, rights, warrants or
	appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant
	to Section 5.6;


	 


	(i) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to
	be made by the General Partner acting alone;


	 


	(j) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by
	a Merger Agreement permitted by Article XIV;


	 


	(k) an amendment that the General Partner determines in its
	sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate to reflect and
	account for the formation by the Partnership of, or investment
	by the Partnership in, any corporation, partnership, joint
	venture, limited liability company or other entity;


	 


	(l) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by
	an amendment to any Carlyle Holdings Partnership Agreement that
	requires unitholders of any Carlyle Holdings Partnership to
	provide a statement, certification or other proof of evidence to
	the Carlyle Holdings Partnerships regarding whether such
	unitholder is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on
	the income generated by the Carlyle Holdings Partnerships;


	 


	(m) a merger, conversion or conveyance pursuant to
	Section 14.3(c), including any amendment permitted pursuant
	to Section 14.5;


	 


	(n) any amendment to Section 16.9 that the General
	Partner determines in good faith;


	 


	(o) any amendment that the General Partner determines to be
	necessary or appropriate to cure any ambiguity, omission,
	mistake, defect or inconsistency; or


	 


	(p) any other amendments substantially similar to the
	foregoing.


	 



	Section

	 13.2.  

	Amendment
	Procedures.



	 


	Except as provided in Sections 5.5, 13.1, 13.3 and 14.5,
	all amendments to this Agreement shall be made in accordance
	with the requirements of this Section 13.2. Amendments to
	this Agreement may be proposed only by the General Partner;
	provided however that, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
	the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose
	any amendment to this





	A-43








	 






	Agreement and may decline to do so free of any duty (including
	any fiduciary duty) or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership,
	any Limited Partner, any other Person bound by this Agreement or
	any creditor of the Partnership. A proposed amendment pursuant
	to this Section 13.2 shall be effective upon its approval
	by the General Partner and Unitholders holding a majority of the
	voting power of the Outstanding Voting Units, unless a greater
	or lesser percentage is required under this Agreement. If such
	an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the
	written approval of the requisite percentage of the voting power
	of Outstanding Voting Units or call a meeting of the Unitholders
	to consider and vote on such proposed amendment, in each case in
	accordance with the other provisions of this Article XIII.
	The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final
	adoption of any such proposed amendments.


	 



	Section

	 13.3.  

	Amendment
	Requirements.



	 


	(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1
	and 13.2, no provision of this Agreement that requires the vote
	or consent of Unitholders holding, or holders of, a percentage
	of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Units (including
	Voting Units deemed owned by the General Partner and its
	Affiliates) required to take any action shall be amended,
	altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that
	would have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless
	such amendment is approved by the written consent or the
	affirmative vote of Unitholders or holders of Outstanding Voting
	Units whose aggregate Outstanding Voting Units constitute not
	less than the voting or consent requirement sought to be reduced.


	 


	(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2,
	no amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations
	of any Limited Partner without its consent, unless such
	enlargement may be deemed to have occurred as a result of an
	amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c), or (ii) enlarge
	the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights
	of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable
	or otherwise payable to the General Partner or any of its
	Affiliates without the General Partners consent, which
	consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion.


	 


	(c) Except as provided in Sections 13.1 and 14.3, any
	amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the
	rights or preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in
	relation to other classes of Partnership Interests (treating the
	Voting Units as a separate class for this purpose) must be
	approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the
	Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class affected.


	 


	(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1
	and 13.2, in addition to any other approvals or consents that
	may be required under this Agreement, neither Section 7.13
	nor Section 13.4(b) shall be amended, altered, changed,
	repealed or rescinded in any respect without the written consent
	of TCG Partners.


	 


	(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	except for amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except
	as otherwise provided by Article XIV, no amendments shall
	become effective without the approval of Unitholders holding at
	least 90% of the voting power of the Outstanding Voting Units
	unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the
	effect that such amendment will not affect the limited liability
	of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act.


	 



	Section

	 13.4.  

	Meetings

	.


	 


	(a) All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to
	this Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this
	Article XIII. Special meetings of the Limited Partners may
	be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
	representing 50% or more of the voting power of the Outstanding
	Limited Partner Interests of the class or classes for which a
	meeting is proposed. (For the avoidance of doubt, the Common
	Units and the Special Voting Units shall not constitute separate
	classes for this purpose.) Limited Partners shall call a special
	meeting by delivering to the General Partner one or more
	requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners
	wish to call a special





	A-44








	 






	meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for
	which the special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days
	after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within
	such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the
	Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations,
	listing, agreements or similar requirements governing the
	holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at
	such a meeting, the General Partner shall send a notice of the
	meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly
	through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time
	and place determined by the General Partner in its sole
	discretion on a date not less than 10 days nor more than
	60 days after the mailing of notice of the meeting. Limited
	Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the Limited
	Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and
	control of the business and affairs of the Partnership within
	the meaning of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act so as to
	jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability under
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act or the law of any other
	state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.


	 


	(b) (i) Subject to Section 7.13 and
	Section 13.4(b)(xi), in any year in which the General
	Partner has determined on the applicable Determination Date that
	the Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition has not been satisfied,
	an annual meeting of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding
	Units for the election of Directors and such other matters as
	the General Partner shall submit to a vote of the Limited
	Partners holding Outstanding Units shall be held in June of such
	year or at such other date and time as may be fixed by the
	General Partner at such place within or without the State of
	Delaware as may be fixed by the General Partner and all as
	stated in the notice of the meeting. Notice of the annual
	meeting shall be given in accordance with Section 13.5 not
	less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
	date of such meeting.


	 


	(ii) The Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units shall
	vote together as a single class for the election of Directors to
	the Board of Directors (but such Limited Partners and their
	Units shall not, however, be treated as a separate class of
	Partners or Partnership Securities for purposes of this
	Agreement). The Limited Partners described in the immediately
	preceding sentence shall elect by a plurality of the votes cast
	at such meeting persons to serve as Directors who are nominated
	in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.4(b).
	The exercise by a Limited Partner of the right to elect the
	Directors and any other rights afforded to such Limited Partner
	under this Section 13.4(b) shall be in such Limited
	Partners capacity as a limited partner of the Partnership
	and shall not cause a Limited Partner to be deemed to be taking
	part in the management and control of the business and affairs
	of the Partnership so as to jeopardize such Limited
	Partners limited liability under the Delaware Limited
	Partnership Act or the law of any other state in which the
	Partnership is qualified to do business.


	 


	(iii) If the General Partner has provided at least thirty
	days advance notice of any meeting at which Directors are to be
	elected, then the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units
	that attend such meeting shall constitute a quorum, and if the
	General Partner has provided less than thirty days advance
	notice of any such meeting, then Limited Partners holding a
	majority of the Outstanding Units shall constitute a quorum.


	 


	(iv) The number of Directors on the Board of Directors
	shall be as determined in accordance with the General Partner
	Agreement.


	 


	(v) The Directors shall be divided into three classes,
	Class I, Class II, and Class III, as determined by the
	then-existing Board of Directors in its sole discretion, on any
	Determination Date on which the General Partner has determined
	that the Carlyle Partners Ownership Condition has not been
	satisfied, unless the Board of Directors has already been
	classified in accordance with this Section 13.4(b)(v) on the
	next preceding Determination Date. The number of Directors in
	each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient
	arrived at by dividing the authorized number of Directors by
	three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient,
	then if such fraction is one-third, the extra director shall be
	a member of Class I and if the fraction is two-thirds, one
	of the extra directors shall be a member of Class I and the
	other shall be a member of Class II. Each Director shall
	serve for a term ending as provided herein; provided, however,
	that the Directors





	A-45








	 






	designated to Class I by the Board of Directors shall serve
	for an initial term that expires at the applicable Initial
	Annual Meeting, the Directors designated to Class II by the
	Board of Directors shall serve for an initial term that expires
	at the first annual meeting of Limited Partners following the
	applicable Initial Annual Meeting, and the Directors designated
	to Class III by the Board of Directors shall serve for an
	initial term that expires at the second annual meeting of
	Limited Partners following the applicable Initial Annual
	Meeting. At each succeeding annual meeting of Limited Partners
	for the election of Directors following an Initial Annual
	Meeting, successors to the Directors whose term expires at that
	annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term.


	 


	(vi) Each Director shall hold office for the term for which
	such Director is elected and thereafter until such
	Directors successor shall have been duly elected and
	qualified, or until such Directors earlier death,
	resignation or removal. If, in any year in which an annual
	meeting of the Limited Partners for the election of Directors is
	required to be held in accordance with Section 7.13 and
	this Section 13.4(b), the number of Directors is changed,
	any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes
	of Directors so as to maintain the number of Directors in each
	class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional Director
	of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an
	increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall
	coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case
	will a decrease in the number of Directors shorten the term of
	any incumbent Director. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors
	(including, without limitation, any vacancy caused by an
	increase in the number of Directors on the Board of Directors)
	may only be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining
	Directors. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting
	from an increase in the number of Directors shall have the same
	remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. A Director may
	be removed only at a meeting of the Limited Partners upon the
	affirmative vote of Limited Partners holding a majority of the
	Outstanding Units; provided, however, a Director may only be
	removed if, at the same meeting, Limited Partners holding a
	majority of the Outstanding Units nominate a replacement
	Director (and any such nomination shall not be subject to the
	nomination procedures otherwise set forth in this
	Section 13.4), and Limited Partners holding a majority of
	the Outstanding Units also vote to elect a replacement Director,
	and, provided, further, a Director may only be removed for cause.


	 


	(vii) (A) (1) Nominations of persons for election of
	Directors to the Board of Directors of the General Partner may
	be made at an annual meeting of the Limited Partners only
	pursuant to the General Partners notice of meeting (or any
	supplement thereto) (a) by or at the direction of a
	majority of the Directors or (b) by a Limited Partner, or a
	group of Limited Partners, that holds or beneficially owns, and
	has continuously held or beneficially owned without interruption
	for the prior eighteen (18) months, 5% of the Outstanding
	Units (in either case, a Limited Partner Group) if
	each member of the Limited Partner Group was a Record Holder at
	the time the notice provided for in this
	Section 13.4(b)(vii) is delivered to the General Partner,
	and if the Limited Partner Group complies with the notice
	procedures set forth in this Section 13.4(b)(vii).


	 


	(2) For any nominations brought before an annual meeting by
	a Limited Partner Group pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph
	(A)(1) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii), the Limited Partner
	Group must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
	General Partner. To be timely, a Limited Partner Groups
	notice shall be delivered to the General Partner not later than
	the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier
	than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th)
	day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years
	annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the
	date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days
	before or more than seventy (70) days after such
	anniversary date, notice by the Limited Partner Group must be so
	delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one
	hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and
	not later than the close of business on the later of the
	ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth
	(10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the
	date of such meeting is first made by the Partnership or the
	General Partner). For purposes of any Initial Annual Meeting,
	the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
	meeting shall be deemed to be June 30 of that year. In no event
	shall the public announcement of an





	A-46








	 






	adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new
	time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
	Limited Partner Groups notice as described above. Such
	Limited Partner Groups notice shall set forth: (a) as
	to each person whom the Limited Partner Group proposes to
	nominate for election as Director (i) all information
	relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
	solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an
	election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case
	pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the
	Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder and (ii) such persons written
	consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and
	to serving as a Director if elected; and (b) as to each
	member of the Limited Partner Group giving the notice and the
	beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made
	(i) the name and address of such Limited Partners, as they
	appear on the Partnerships books and records, and of such
	beneficial owners, (ii) the type and number of Units which
	are owned beneficially and of record by such Limited Partners
	and such beneficial owners, (iii) a description of any
	agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the
	nomination between or among any or all members of such Limited
	Partner Group

	and/or

	such
	beneficial owners, any of their respective Affiliates or
	associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the
	foregoing, including each nominee, (iv) a description of
	any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any
	derivative or short positions, profit interests, options,
	warrants, equity appreciation or similar rights, hedging
	transactions, and borrowed or loaned Units) that has been
	entered into as of the date of the Limited Partner Groups
	notice by, or on behalf of, any members of such Limited Partner
	Group and such beneficial owners, the effect or intent of which
	is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of Unit price
	changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such
	Limited Partners and such beneficial owner, with respect to
	Units, (v) a representation that each member of the Limited
	Partner Group is a Record Holder entitled to vote at such
	meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
	meeting to propose such nomination, (vi) a representation
	whether any member of the Limited Partner Group or the
	beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which
	intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement

	and/or

	form
	of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
	Partnerships Outstanding Units required to elect the
	nominee

	and/or

	(b) otherwise to solicit proxies from Limited Partners in
	support of such nomination, and (vii) any other information
	relating to any member of such Limited Partner Group and
	beneficial owners, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy
	statement or other filings required to be made in connection
	with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in
	an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with
	Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules
	and regulations promulgated thereunder. A Limited Partner Group
	providing notice of a proposed nomination for election to the
	Board of Directors shall update and supplement such notice from
	time to time to the extent necessary so that the information
	provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true
	and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the
	date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any
	adjournment or postponement thereof; such update and supplement
	shall be delivered in writing to the General Partner at the
	principal executive offices of the General Partner not later
	than five (5) days after the record date for the meeting
	(in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as
	of the record date), and not later than ten (10) days prior
	to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
	thereof (in the case of any update and supplement required to be
	made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any
	adjournment or postponement thereof). The General Partner may
	require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information
	as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of
	such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the General
	Partner.


	 


	(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of
	paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii) to the contrary,
	in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the
	Board of Directors of the General Partner is increased effective
	after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be
	due under paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii) and
	there is no public announcement by the Partnership or the
	General Partner naming the nominees for the additional
	directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the
	first anniversary of the preceding years





	A-47








	 






	annual meeting, a Limited Partner Groups notice required
	by this Section 13.4(b)(vii) shall also be considered
	timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional
	directorships, if it shall be delivered to the General Partner
	not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
	following the day on which such public announcement is first
	made by the Partnership or the General Partner.


	 


	(B) Nominations of persons for election as a Director to
	the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of
	Limited Partners at which Directors are to be elected pursuant
	to the General Partners notice of meeting (1) by or
	at the direction of a majority of the Directors or
	(2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined
	that Directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any Limited
	Partner Group pursuant to Section 13.4(a) hereof, if each
	member of such Limited Partner Group is a Record Holder at the
	time the notice provided for in this Section 13.4(b)(vii)
	is delivered to the General Partner and if the Limited Partner
	Group complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
	Section 13.4(b)(vii). In the event the General Partner
	calls a special meeting of Limited Partners for the purpose of
	electing one or more Directors to the Board of Directors, any
	such Limited Partner Group may nominate a person or persons (as
	the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified
	in the General Partners notice of meeting, if the Limited
	Partner Groups notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this
	Section 13.4(b)(vii) shall be delivered to the General
	Partner not earlier than the close of business on the one
	hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and
	not later than the close of business on the later of the
	ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth
	(10th) day following the day on which public announcement is
	first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
	nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at
	such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an
	adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new
	time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
	Limited Partner Groups notice as described above.


	 


	(C) (1) Only such persons who are nominated in
	accordance with the procedures set forth in this
	Section 13.4(b) shall be eligible to be elected at an
	annual or special meeting of Limited Partners to serve as
	Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman
	designated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 13.10
	shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a
	nomination was made in accordance with the procedures set forth
	in this Section 13.4(b) (including whether the members of
	the Limited Partner Group or beneficial owner, if any, on whose
	behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group
	which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be,
	proxies in support of such Limited Partner Groups nominee
	in compliance with such Limited Partner Groups
	representation as required by clause (A)(2)(b)(vi) of this
	Section 13.4(b)(vii)) and (b) if any proposed
	nomination was not made in compliance with this
	Section 13.4(b), to declare that such nomination shall be
	disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
	Section 13.4(b), unless otherwise required by law, if each
	member of the Limited Partner Group (or a qualified
	representative of each member of the Limited Partner Group) does
	not appear at the annual or special meeting of Limited Partners
	to present a nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded
	notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
	been received by the General Partner or the Partnership. For
	purposes of this Section 13.4(b), to be considered a qualified
	representative of a member of the Limited Partner Group, a
	person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of
	such Limited Partner or must be authorized by a writing executed
	by such Limited Partner or an electronic transmission delivered
	by such Limited Partner to act for such Limited Partner as proxy
	at the meeting of Limited Partners and such person must produce
	such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
	reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the
	meeting of Limited Partners.


	 


	(2) For purposes of this Section 13.4(b)(vii),
	public announcement shall include disclosure in a
	press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated
	Press or other national news service or in a document publicly
	filed by the Partnership or the General Partner with the
	Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder.




	A-48








	 






	 


	(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
	Section 13.4(b)(vii), a Limited Partner shall also comply
	with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
	and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
	matters set forth in this Section 13.4(b)(vii); provided
	however, that any references in this Agreement to the Securities
	Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
	are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements
	applicable to nominations pursuant to this Section 13.4(b)(vii)
	(including paragraphs A(1) and B hereof), and compliance
	with paragraphs A(1)(b) and B of this Section 13.4(b)(vii)
	shall be the exclusive means for a Limited Partner to make
	nominations.


	 


	(viii) This Section 13.4(b) shall not be deemed in any
	way to limit or impair the ability of the Board of Directors to
	adopt a poison pill or unitholder or other similar
	rights plan with respect to the Partnership, whether such poison
	pill or plan contains dead hand provisions, no
	hand provisions or other provisions relating to the
	redemption of the poison pill or plan, in each case as such
	terms are used under Delaware common law.


	 


	(ix) The Partnership and the General Partner shall use
	their commercially reasonable best efforts to take such action
	as shall be necessary or appropriate to give effect to and
	implement the provisions of this Section 13.4(b),
	including, without limitation, amending the organizational
	documents of the General Partner such that at all times the
	organizational documents of the General Partner shall provide
	(i) that in any year in which the General Partner has
	determined on the applicable Determination Date that the Carlyle
	Partners Ownership Condition has not been satisfied the
	Directors shall be elected in accordance with the terms of this
	Agreement, and (ii) terms consistent with this Section
	13.4(b).


	 


	(x) If the General Partner delegates to an existing or
	newly formed wholly owned Subsidiary the power and authority to
	manage and control the business and affairs of the Partnership
	Group, the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.4(b)
	shall be applicable with respect to the Board of Directors or
	other governing body of such Subsidiary.


	 


	(xi) During the period beginning on any Determination Date
	on which the General Partner has determined that the Carlyle
	Partners Ownership Condition has been satisfied until the next
	succeeding Determination Date, if any, on which the General
	Partner has determined that the Carlyle Partners Ownership
	Condition has not been satisfied, the provisions of this
	Section 13.4(b) shall automatically not apply, the Board of
	Directors shall not be classified, Directors shall not be
	elected by the Limited Partners, and the Directors shall be
	nominated and elected and may be removed solely in accordance
	with the General Partner Agreement.


	 



	Section

	 13.5.  

	Notice
	of a Meeting.



	 


	Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall
	be given to the Record Holders of the class or classes of
	Limited Partner Interests for which a meeting is proposed in
	writing by mail or other means of written communication in
	accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to
	have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent
	by other means of written communication.


	 



	Section

	 13.6.  

	Record
	Date.



	 


	For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to
	notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to
	give approvals without a meeting as provided in
	Section 13.11 the General Partner may set a Record Date,
	which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days
	before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement
	conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of
	any National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner
	Interests are listed for trading, in which case the rule,
	regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities
	Exchange shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals
	are sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners
	are requested in writing by the General Partner to give such
	approvals (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
	regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
	Exchange on which the Limited Partner Interests are listed for
	trading, in which





	A-49








	 






	case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such
	National Securities Exchange shall govern). If the General
	Partner does not set a Record Date, then (a) the Record
	Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of
	or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners shall be the
	close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
	day on which notice is given, and (b) the Record Date for
	determining the Limited Partners entitled to give approvals
	without a meeting shall be the date the first written approval
	is deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner
	in accordance with Section 13.11.


	 



	Section

	 13.7.  

	Adjournment.



	 


	When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice
	need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date
	need not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced
	at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless such
	adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
	adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business
	which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
	adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record
	Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the
	adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this
	Article XIII.


	 



	Section

	 13.8.  

	Waiver
	of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes.



	 


	The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however
	called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if
	it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular call and
	notice if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy.
	Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a
	waiver of notice of the meeting, except (i) when the
	Limited Partner attends the meeting solely for the express
	purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
	transaction of any business at such meeting because the meeting
	is not lawfully called or convened, and takes no other action,
	and (ii) that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of
	any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to
	be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included,
	if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting.


	 



	Section

	 13.9.  

	Quorum.



	 


	Subject to Section 13.4(b), the Limited Partners holding a
	majority of the voting power of the Outstanding Limited Partner
	Interests of the class or classes for which a meeting has been
	called (including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by the
	General Partner) represented in person or by proxy shall
	constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such
	class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners
	requires approval by Limited Partners holding a greater
	percentage of the voting power of such Limited Partner
	Interests, in which case the quorum shall be such greater
	percentage. (For the avoidance of doubt, the Common Units and
	the Special Voting Units shall not constitute separate classes
	for this purpose.) At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly
	called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a
	quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding a
	majority Limited Partner votes cast shall be deemed to
	constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or
	different percentage is required with respect to such action
	under this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited
	Partners holding Outstanding Limited Partner Interests that in
	the aggregate represent at least such greater or lesser
	percentage of the voting power shall be required. The Limited
	Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a
	quorum is present may continue to transact business until
	adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Limited
	Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other
	than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of the
	voting power of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests specified
	in this Agreement (including Outstanding Limited Partner
	Interests deemed owned by the General Partner). In the absence
	of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be adjourned
	from time to time by the affirmative vote of Limited Partners
	holding at least a majority of the voting power of the
	Outstanding Limited Partner Interests present and entitled to
	vote at such meeting (including Outstanding Limited Partner
	Interests deemed owned by the General Partner) represented
	either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be
	transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.

	Section

	 13.10.  

	Conduct
	of a Meeting.



	 


	The General Partner shall have full power and authority
	concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited
	Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the
	determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a
	quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of
	Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and
	effect of any proxies and the determination of any
	controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or
	during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall
	designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting, who
	shall, among other things, be entitled to exercise the powers of
	the General Partner set forth in this Section 13.10, and
	the General Partner shall further designate a Person to take the
	minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the
	records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner.
	The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent
	with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem necessary
	or advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the
	Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing,
	including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies,
	the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals,
	the submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of
	the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals, proxies and
	votes in writing.


	 



	Section

	 13.11.  

	Action
	Without a Meeting.



	 


	If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be
	taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without
	a meeting, without a vote and without prior notice, if consented
	to in writing or by electronic transmission by Limited Partners
	owning not less than the minimum percentage of the voting power
	of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests (including Limited
	Partner Interests deemed owned by the General Partner) that
	would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting
	at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless
	such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or
	requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the
	Limited Partner Interests or a class thereof are listed for
	trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or
	requirement of such exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the
	taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
	Partners who have not consented. The General Partner may specify
	that any written ballot, if any, submitted to Limited Partners
	for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be
	returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall
	be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner
	in its sole discretion. If a ballot returned to the Partnership
	does not vote all of the Limited Partner Interests held by the
	Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed
	to receive a ballot for the Limited Partner Interests that were
	not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the
	Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on
	behalf of the General Partner, any written approvals or
	approvals transmitted by electronic transmission shall have no
	force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited
	with the Partnership in care of the General Partner,
	(b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are
	dated or transmitted as of a date not more than 90 days
	prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with the
	Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to
	the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such
	right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any
	particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners
	to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of
	the business and affairs of the Partnership within the meaning
	of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act so as to jeopardize the
	Limited Partners limited liability, and (ii) is
	otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing
	the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the
	Partners. Nothing contained in this Section 13.11 shall be
	deemed to require the General Partner to solicit all Limited
	Partners in connection with a matter approved by the requisite
	percentage of the voting power of Limited Partners or other
	holders of Outstanding Voting Units acting by written consent or
	consent by electronic transmission without a meeting.


	 



	Section

	 13.12.  

	Voting
	and Other Rights

	.


	 


	(a) Only those Record Holders of Outstanding Limited
	Partner Interests on the Record Date set pursuant to
	Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained
	in the definition of





	A-51








	 






	

	Outstanding

	 and the limitations set forth in
	Section 13.4(b)) shall be entitled to notice of, and to
	vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to
	matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Limited
	Partner Interests have the right to vote or to act. All
	references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may
	be taken by, the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests shall be
	deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record
	Holders of such Outstanding Limited Partner Interests. Each
	Common Unit shall entitle the holder thereof (other than a
	Non-Voting Common Unitholder) to one vote for each Common Unit
	held of record by such holder as of the relevant Record Date.


	 


	(b) With respect to Limited Partner Interests that are held
	for a Persons account by another Person (such as a broker,
	dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent
	of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Limited Partner
	Interests are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising
	the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner Interests
	on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons
	provides otherwise, vote such Limited Partner Interests in favor
	of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the Beneficial
	Owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so
	acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this
	Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this
	Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.


	 


	(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	for the avoidance of doubt, a Non-Voting Common Unitholder shall
	be subject to the limitations on voting set forth in this
	Section 13.12(c) for so long as it is a Limited Partner or
	Beneficially Owns any Common Units. Notwithstanding any other
	provision of this Agreement or the terms of any Common Units, a
	Non-Voting Common Unitholder shall have no voting rights
	whatsoever with respect to the Partnership, including any voting
	rights that may otherwise exist for Limited Partners or holders
	of Common Units hereunder, under the Act, at law, in equity or
	otherwise; provided that any amendment of this Agreement that
	would have a material adverse effect on the rights or
	preferences of the Common Units Beneficially Owned by Non-Voting
	Common Unitholders in relation to other Common Units (treating
	the Common Units Beneficially Owned by Non-Voting Common
	Unitholders as a separate class for this purpose) must be
	approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the
	Common Units Beneficially Owned by the Non-Voting Common
	Unitholders. Each Non-Voting Common Unitholder hereby further
	irrevocably waives any right it may otherwise have to vote to
	elect or appoint a successor General Partner or Liquidator under
	the Act in its capacity as Limited Partner or with respect to
	any Common Units owned by it.


	 



	Section

	 13.13.  

	Participation
	of Special Voting Units in All Actions Participated in by Common
	Units

	.


	 


	(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act or any applicable law, rule
	or regulation, but subject to Section 13.13(b) with respect
	to the voting matters addressed therein, each of the Partners
	and each other Person who may acquire an interest in Partnership
	Securities hereby agrees that the holders of Special Voting
	Units (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries) shall be
	entitled to receive notice of, be included in any requisite
	quora for and participate in any and all approvals, votes or
	other actions of the Partners on an equivalent basis as, and
	treating such Persons for all purposes as if they are, Limited
	Partners holding Common Units that are not Non-Voting Common
	Unitholders (including, without limitation, the notices, quora,
	approvals, votes and other actions contemplated by
	Sections 4.6(a), 7.3, 7.7(c), 7.9(a), 11.1(b), 12.1(b),
	12.2, 12.3, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.8, 13.9, 13.10,
	13.11, 13.12, 14.3 and 16.1 hereof), including any and all
	notices, quora, approvals, votes and other actions that may be
	taken pursuant to the requirements of the Delaware Limited
	Partnership Act or any other applicable law, rule or regulation.
	This Agreement shall be construed in all cases to give maximum
	effect to such agreement.


	 


	(b) Notwithstanding Section 13.13(a) or any other
	provision of this Agreement, the holders of Special Voting
	Units, as such, collectively shall be entitled (A) prior to
	the Closing Date, to all of the Limited Partner votes (and no
	other Limited Partners, as such, shall be entitled to any
	Limited Partner votes) and (B) from and after the Closing
	Date, to a number of Limited Partner votes that is equal to the
	product of (x) the total number of Carlyle Holdings
	Partnership Units outstanding





	A-52








	 






	(excluding Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units held by the
	Partnership or its Subsidiaries) as of the relevant Record
	Date

	multiplied by

	(y) the Exchange Rate (as defined
	in the Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to Section 5.3 hereof,
	(i) TCG Partners, as holder of a Special Voting Unit, shall
	be entitled to a number of votes that is equal to the product of
	(x) the total number of Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units
	held of record by each Carlyle Holdings Partner that does not
	hold a Special Voting Unit

	multiplied by

	(y) the
	Exchange Rate (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) and
	(ii) each other holder of Special Voting Units, as such,
	shall be entitled, without regard to the number of Special
	Voting Units (or fraction thereof) held by such holder, to a
	number of votes that is equal to the product of (x) the
	total number of Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units held of
	record by such holder

	multiplied by

	(y) the Exchange
	Rate (as defined in the Exchange Agreement). The number of votes
	to which each holder of a Special Voting Unit shall be entitled
	from and after the Closing Date shall be adjusted accordingly if
	(i) a Limited Partner holding Common Units, as such, shall
	become entitled to a number of votes other than one for each
	Common Unit held

	and/or

	(ii) under the terms of the Exchange Agreement the holders
	of Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units party thereto shall become
	entitled to exchange each such unit for a number of Common Units
	other than one. The holders of Special Voting Units shall vote
	together with the Limited Partners holding Common Units as a
	single class and, to the extent that the Limited Partners
	holding Common Units shall vote together with the holders of any
	other class of Partnership Interest, the holders of Special
	Voting Units shall also vote together with the holders of such
	other class of Partnership Interests on an equivalent basis as
	the Limited Partners holding Common Units.


	 


	(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
	this Agreement, and in addition to any other vote required by
	the Delaware Limited Partnership Act or this Agreement, the
	affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
	voting power of the Special Voting Units (excluding Special
	Voting Units held by the Partnership and its Subsidiaries)
	voting separately as a class shall be required to alter, amend
	or repeal this Section 13.13 or to adopt any provision
	inconsistent therewith.

	MERGER



	 



	Section

	 14.1.  

	Authority.



	 


	The Partnership may merge or consolidate or otherwise combine
	with or into one or more corporations, limited liability
	companies, statutory trusts or associations, real estate
	investment trusts, common law trusts, unincorporated businesses
	or other Person permitted by the Delaware Limited Partnership
	Act, including a partnership (whether general or limited
	(including a limited liability partnership or a limited
	liability limited partnership)), pursuant to a written agreement
	of merger, consolidation or other business combination
	(

	Merger Agreement

	) in accordance with this
	Article XIV.


	 



	Section

	 14.2.  

	Procedure
	for Merger, Consolidation or Other Business Combination.



	 


	Merger, consolidation or other business combination of the
	Partnership pursuant to this Article XIV requires the prior
	consent of the General Partner, provided however that, to the
	fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall have
	no duty or obligation to consent to any merger, consolidation or
	other business combination of the Partnership and, to the
	fullest extent permitted by law, may decline to do so free of

	which such Limited Partner Interests of such class are listed or
	admitted to trading or, if such Limited Partner Interests of
	such class are not listed or admitted to trading on any National
	Securities Exchange, the last quoted price on such day or, if
	not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices
	on such day in the

	over-the-counter

	) and shall
	cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such Notice of
	Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner
	Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the
	General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days
	prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase
	shall also be published for a period of at least three
	consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general
	circulation printed in the English language and circulated in
	the Borough of Manhattan, New York City. The Notice of Election
	to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price
	(determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which

	Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of
	Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited
	Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the records of
	the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
	given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On
	or prior to the Purchase Date, the General Partner, its
	Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit
	with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
	aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner
	Interests to be purchased in accordance with this
	Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall
	have been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to
	the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the
	deposit described in the preceding sentence has been made for
	the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject
	to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase
	Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been
	surrendered for purchase, all rights of the holders of such
	Limited Partner Interests (including any rights pursuant to
	Articles IV, V, VI, and XII) shall thereupon
	cease, except the right to receive the purchase price
	(determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for Limited
	Partner Interests therefor, without interest (in the case of
	Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon
	surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates representing
	such Limited Partner Interests) and such Limited Partner
	Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the
	General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case
	may be, on the record books of the Transfer Agent and the
	Partnership, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the
	General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall
	be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests
	from and after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as
	the owner of such Limited Partner Interests (including all
	rights as owner of such Limited Partner Interests pursuant to
	Articles IV, V, VI and XII).
