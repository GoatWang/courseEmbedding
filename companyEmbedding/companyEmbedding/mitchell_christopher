Charity Work - Mitchell Christopher Salon

Charity Work 




Did you know…
For the past 12 years, Mitchell Christopher Salon has volunteered our time and talents to several great causes.





Matter Of Trust
Did you know? 2600 oil spills happen yearly without us knowing about it? This year, our focus is to help save our oceans and lakes one strand of hair at a time. We want our children and grand-children to have a beautiful Earth to admire and respect. What can we do about this? We have recently found that hair absorbs oil very effectively. A former hairdresser invented Hair Mats. These mats are currently being used globally to help absorb oil spills in our oceans and lakes. Where do we come in? Because we are in the art and business of hair, we are the likely source for their key ingredient: HAIR. We collect hair that has been cut from our guests and ship it directly to the company that manufactures these hair mats. How cool is that? It costs us nothing other than shipping and handling of the hair. By getting your haircut at Mitchell Christopher Salon, did you know are helping save the environment one strand of hair at a time?
For more information, please visit www.matteroftrust.org


















St. Baldricks Foundation
Where one shaved head at a time, is “shaving” the way to conquer kid’s cancers. We are proud to be a part of a great foundation and have unselfishly volunteered yearly for the past 7 years.
Please visit or donate to www.stbaldricks.org






Hurricane Katrina Cut-a-thon
To help with the desperate needs of Hurricane Katrina victims, the staff of Mitchell Christopher Salon did an all day cut-a-thon helping to raise over $12,000. We were very fortunate to have a client’s private company give a helping hand by matching what we raised.


















Children’s Memorial Hospital
For over 12 years, Dean Damolaris (co-owner) has volunteered his haircutting skills to patients and families of illness stricken children of Children’s Memorial Hospital. He provides the gift of beauty to those who would otherwise not think of themselves as they spend their time and energy hoping and praying for the speedy recovery of their child.






Recycling
We recycling all of our color tubes, color bottles, foils, and anything recyclable.

Our Reviews 






















We’d love for you to share your Mitchell Christopher Salon experience with us and with the rest of the world.
Click on a button to the left to write a review.





I started patronizing Dean in 1992. He is the only one I allow to cut my hair. Always fun. Always friendly. Always perfect. I only wish he was more willing to discuss politics. – Jeff E.
My wife has Cancer and she asked me to grow my hair long because she lost hers during Chemo. She now asked me to get it cut so we went to Mitchell Christopher and what a great choice that was. Dean was my stylist and he couldn’t have been any nicer. I didn’t get a haircut for over 2 years and didn’t have a good idea on how to proceed. Dean made everything so easy, I look great. Everyone in the Salon were so friendly we didn’t want to leave. My wife while waiting for me also got a haircut (not much hair but she looks great) and they didn’t charge her.I can’t wait for my hair to grow out so I can go back. – Ben
I have never experience such quality as I did at Mitchell Christopher Salon. Let me tell you that my hair was 3 different colors & one of those colors were an ugly black! Dean not only got my hair back to it’s original color, but it was all one color & the cut & style were perfect for me. I can’t wait to go back again! 🙂 – Sarah Medina
I have been to many salons, and some are better and friendlier than others. However, when it was time for me to get a new short hairstyle for the new year, I can only trust Mariefel at Mitchell Christopher Salon because she truly knows what to do with my very thick, coarse and pretty damaged, wavy, long hair. It was that time when I was ready for a change. So I got some color/highlights, keratin treatment and haircut all in one day. Everything was excellent!  Now, thanks to Mariefel and this salon, I have a healthier, shinier and super chic hairstyle that I love. Very happy to report that everyone who has seen my new hairstyle loved it too. – Ruth L.
I looooved my new hair color, so shinny even weeks after. My hair do and makeup for the wedding was absolutely amazing, I looked great in all my photos. Thank you Mariefel for my makeover, can’t wait for the next one! – Argentina Leyva
I live in Waukegan and make the 50 mile trip to get my hair done at Mitchell Christopher Salon!  It is definitely worth the trip. I have been going there since the salon opened and I wouldn’t go anywhere else. The color and cut that Mariefel does is so natural that friends can’t believe that my color is not natural.  When I go in and just don’t know what I want to do with my hair – I leave it up to Mariefel and I have never been disappointed. She is awesome!  The atmosphere in the salon is so welcoming and friendly. The staff is great. – Annie
I’ve been going to Mitchell Christopher for years, and I’ve never been disappointed! I’ve used a few of their stylists, but I’ve been going to Chris for the last few years and absolutely love her! She’s the only stylist I’ve ever been able to go to and say, “I need something different” and she ALWAYS does a great job! Chris and Mariefel even did my hair and makeup for my wedding and it was flawless. The assistants are great and all the stylists are so welcoming….I could never ask for a better salon and staff.  – Melissa
Rachel did my galaxy hair and red dip dye on my hair and it turned out gorgeous. I get compliments literally every day on my purple, pink, blue and green hair. I will keep coming back to Rachel for sure – she always knows what’s on trend and how to do it. – Jessica S.
Love, love, loved this salon! Has a great vibe and is very welcoming. Rachel did highlights and a cut and made my hair look fantastic! She is a Redken certified stylist – which made me confident in her abilities. I always appreciate a clean, friendly, skilled salon. I highly recommend Mitchell Christopher Salon.  Great service and value – you will love it here! – Veronica B.

Jack's Life 
A Memory of C.S Lewis


Mitchell, Christopher (Foreword by)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Gresham, Douglas (With)	
									        	
									




The stepson of C. S. Lewis offers an informal, loving memoir of the man he knew as "Jack."




Description


Douglas Gresham claims that Jack Lewis was the finest man and the best Christian he has ever known. Of course, Jack to Douglas is C. S. Lewis to the rest of the world. The informal address Gresham uses to refer to the great writer is indicative of the intimacy he shared with Lewis for a dozen years, living in England as Lewis's stepson.Jack's Life is an affectionate account of days now long gone. It is a personal memoir of a man who touched many in the classroom, even more with his pen, and made a significant, lasting, and eternal impression on one young man. Douglas Gresham is uniquely qualified to offer such an extraordinary portrait.
