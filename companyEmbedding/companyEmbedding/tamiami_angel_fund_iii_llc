FAQs 



What is an Angel Investor?Angel investors are wealthy individuals who invest in high risk, early stage ventures by reserving a portion of their total investment portfolios to provide emerging companies with seed and startup capital through direct, private investments. Their goal is to achieve higher returns than the typical public markets provide. Most angels are active investors - who contribute their time and experience, as well as offer introductions to valuable contacts essential to the companys success - because they enjoy the thrill of helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses. To maximize the value added, most angels specialize in industries or technologies they understand, and invest only in companies within close geographic proximity.What is an Angel Group?Angel investor groups vary in structure, from formal to informal. Formal groups follow strict participation requirements that guide members minimum investment activity and event attendance. Some groups pool members capital to make investments on the groups behalf, while others allow individual members to invest in specific deals of interest.What do you look for in companies?We invest in companies that offer exceptional opportunities for high returns on investment. This usually implies companies with the potential to achieve high growth, strong market position, and sustainable advantages. We generally invest in companies that we believe have the potential to grow to more than $50 million in annual revenue within five years. This should be in either a developing market or in an existing market with national scope.

For Angels



 							Upstart entrepreneurs increasingly dominate the nation’s economy. The life cycle of many new products has become so short that a business can only succeed by reducing its product development phase and accelerating its presence in the global marketplace. In slower times, a business could grow incrementally from region to region, usually from internally generated capital. Nowadays, the demands for rapid growth require outside capital which banks typically are not able to provide. As the institutional venture capital industry continues to focus on later stage and larger investments, the private investor market now provides the major source of seed and start-up capital. However, private investor seed and early stage venture investing is still a relatively young phenomenon. The vast majority of small businesses—more than 90%—are lifestyle businesses. They tend to have low-paying jobs with few benefits. The most important small businesses—in terms of economic development—are rapid-growth SMEs (small to medium sized enterprises) or “gazelles,” which make up only 4-8% of all small businesses but account for 70-75% of net new jobs. “Gazelles,” as MIT economist David Burch calls them, have survived their earliest stages and are rapidly expanding firms. Typically, venture capital is not readily available in the smaller amounts that might be appropriate for a very young or early stage company. Therefore, venture capitalists leave a funding gap. The gap exists as to time – during the earliest stages of a start-ups life, which lasts at least a year – and as to capital – for amounts under $2 million. Angel investors, defined by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission as accredited investors, are commonly identified as those sophisticated enough to fill the funding gaps. Jeffrey Sohl from The Center for Venture Research (CVR) at the University of New Hampshire estimates that Angel Investors provide 86% of the seed and early stage capital to start-ups. Therefore, angels fill the time gap by investing when venture capitalist will not. It is because of this difference in the timing of capital infusion (angels invest in the earliest stages of development) that make angel investing complementary to venture capital investment. An angel investor or “angel” (known as a business angel in Europe), is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up. The origin of term angel investor can be traced to the beginning of the era of Broadway productions in New York City, where individual investors provided the much-needed capital to finance struggling theatre productions requiring a bit more funding. It defined those individuals who would fight against all odds to put up the high risk and early stage money to launch Broadway shows. As a result, those who invested were considered “angels”. The concept migrated west to Hollywood in connection with the movie industry and ultimately spread north to Silicon Valley, where the term has been associated with the seed stage financing rounds of early-stage, emerging-growth technology companies. Today, the term still identifies those individuals that take risks and invests his or her own money in an entrepreneurial company. This concept differentiates angel investors from early stage, later stage or any stage venture capitalists, who invest other people’s money.

Tamiami Angel Fund II invests in ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies
The Tamiami Angel Fund II (T2) has invested $750,000 in ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies, LLC, a company developing new reactor technologies used in the production processes for refining crude oil, producing ammonia and methanol, and reducing iron ore to iron.
The fund recently closed on the investment into its sixth portfolio company, allocating $250,000 in capital interest to ZoneFlow Tech and an additional $500,000 add-on commitment.
ZoneFlow Tech, founded in 2007, is currently testing its proprietary reactor technology designed to improve efficiency in the production of hydrogen and syngas by the steam methane reforming process. 
“We are very pleased to have a Fund like T2 decide to make a major investment in our company, and we treat that as a real compliment to our business plan and what we’ve accomplished to date,” said Bruce Boisture, CEO of ZoneFlow.
“T2’s investment will fund continued product development and testing,” said Gerald Lippes, a member of T2’s due diligence team.
Lippes said the team was impressed by ZoneFlow’s professional management, its knowledge of the industry and its use of financing.
“The company is in the manufacturing business, which gives us an interesting diversity for our fund,” said Timothy Cartwright, chairman of T2. “Most of our fund is invested in high-tech.”
ZoneFlow’s progress was another factor, with the company expecting to introduce its technology in the next few years.
“From the outset, we’ve been involved very heavily with engineering, production and catalyst companies in our industry as we’ve developed our product,” said Boisture. “We have also focused entirely on validation programs that range from joint development of specific product applications to pilot plant testing. The funding from T2, in addition to the capital raise, will allow us to pursue and execute the validation programs, the first of which commenced this month. We also executed the first round of preliminary tests on a separate major testing program that began a year ago.”
 “The company is pretty far along with what it wants to achieve,” Lippes said. “ZoneFlow is starting to test the technology and that’s why we invested. It’s a different product than what’s currently available in the marketplace so its success also depends on the response from the industry.”
The potential game-changing technology has far-reaching applications in a large market, including crude oil refining, making ammonia for fertilizer, producing methanol, and reducing iron ore to iron.

Tamiami Angel Fund II invests in Streann Media


A fast-growing startup in Miami, Florida, Streann Media offers Next Generation streaming and over-the-top (OTT) transformational software for content providers.

Miami, FL(5/5/2016) -
                    The Tamiami Angel Fund II (T2) recently announced an investment in its 10th portfolio company – Streann Media. A fast-growing startup in Miami, Florida, Streann Media offers Next Generation streaming and over-the-top (OTT) transformational software for content providers.“TV, video, and audio are a necessity, but how we consume them is ever-changing,” said Streann Media Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Punzo. “While the market for traditional TV platforms is shrinking, demand for OTT-TV is growing exponentially. The millennial generation wants TV on its tablets, smart TVs and smart phones. Consumers want TV everywhere, and they’re cutting the cord from traditional cable operators that continue to offer the same entertainment without new interactive or innovative development.”Streann Media offers cloud-based, easy-to-integrate solutions that enable content providers, cable operators, mobile operators and TV/radio broadcasters to offer their viewers a “TV everywhere experience” on any smart device. With nearly 64 percent of customers based in Latin America, Streann Media will focus T2’s investment funds in expanding its services into the U.S. and European markets; developing new product features for its video OTT-TV advertising platform; and increasing support staff to manage the growing customer base. “There is a transformation happening in the content market. It’s no longer enough to provide services on demand; we now need to migrate to a platform that gives consumers social interactive features, such as live tweets and virtual reality applications,” said Punzo. “For our B2B customers, our social interactive solutions are integrated with our advertising management platforms, giving them a way to monetize their content.”As part of Streann Media’s focus on social media integration, the company recently showcased its live streaming virtual reality solutions with Oculus (a Facebook company) at this year’s Las Vegas NAB Show – the world’s largest annual conference and expo for professionals who create, manage, and distribute entertainment across all platforms. “Our technology helps engage audiences; we integrate content with social media allowing for better interactivity. Our virtual reality solution allows experiences, such as live concerts, to be streamed through our smart phone applications and viewed through Oculus headsets. We also showcased another Streann market first – our next generation OTT-TV content management system integrated with our advertising platform created to help our customers develop revenue streams from their content.” The recent venture continues T2’s commitment to investing in high-potential, accelerated growth companies. Its members include former executives of major national and global corporations and successful entrepreneurs that have exited their businesses.“T2 sees Streann Media as a disruptive technology based business that will participate in the democratization of streaming video. Content providers, social media influencers and personality brands can launch their own TV channel utilizing Streann Media without ever needing to negotiate a contract with Comcast,” said Timothy J. Cartwright, chairman of T2. “The team has tremendous relationships and a full sales pipeline in Latin and South America, which provides T2 geographic diversification we don’t typically get with a U.S.-based startup.”To learn more about Streann Media, visit www.streann.com. Tamiami Angel Fund I & II LLC are member-managed funds designed to enable private accredited investors to actively participate in a disciplined investment process. The funds invest in promising early-stage through expansion-stage commercial ventures located in the U.S., with a preference to those in the state of Florida. The Funds are members of the Angel Capital Association and the Florida Venture Forum. For more information, visit www.tamiamiangels.com.
