Investment Approach

The Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust (MSIFT) Ultra-Short Income Portfolio seeks current income with capital preservation while maintaining liquidity.

Investment Philosophy
We believe that a conservative ultra-short bond fund offers a compelling strategy that seeks to deliver current income while maintaining a focus on preserving capital and liquidity.
Investment Process
The management team follows a multi-pronged investment process with respect to credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity. Securities are reviewed on an ongoing basis on their ability to maintain creditworthiness taking into consideration factors such as cash flow, asset quality, debt service coverage ratios and economic developments. Additionally, exposure to guarantors and liquidity providers is monitored separately as are the various diversification requirements. The team manages the Portfolio’s assets in an attempt to reduce credit or interest rate risks.

1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income), with the exception of Class A shares of the MSIFT Short Duration Income Portfolio and MSIFT Ultra-Short Income Portfolio, which do not have any front-end sales charge. Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year. Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I shares and Class IS shares as well as the Class IR shares and Institutional Class shares of the MSIFT Ultra-Short Income Portfolio are not subject to a sales charge.
The fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year or until such time as the Board of Trustees of Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust (the "Fund") acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate. In addition, the Distributor, Adviser and Administrator may make additional voluntary fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Effective July 3, 2017, an additional voluntary fee waiver of 0.02% is in effect. The Distributor, Adviser and Administrator may discontinue these voluntary fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements at any time in the future. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund’s current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the region presented. 
Returns are net of fees and assume the reinvestment of all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary. Short-term returns may not be indicative of the fund’s long-term performance potential. A fund’s performance, especially for very short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.
Quality distribution refers to the rating given by S&P Global Ratings (S&P), a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") and is the rating firms’ subjective opinion concerning the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Ratings apply only to portfolio holdings and do not remove the Fund’s market risk. A short-term obligation rated ‘A-1’ is rated in the highest category by S&P. A short-term rated ‘A-2’ by S&P is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. ‘Cash’ includes investments in short term instruments, including investments in Morgan Stanley liquidity funds.
Nonsubsidized yield reflects what the yield would have been had a fee and/ or expense waiver not been in place during the period shown. Subsidized yield current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The 1-day and 7-day current yield is an annualized net yield which assumes dividends are not reinvested in the fund. The 30-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 30 days. SEC yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio’s underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, as of the most recent month-end, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS 
 There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these portfolios Please be aware that these portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In the current rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income.The Portfolio is more susceptible to any economic, business, political, regulatory or other developments that adversely affect issuers in the financial services industry than a fund that does not concentrate its investments in the financial services industry. Asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. Government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Repurchase agreements are subject to default and credit risks. By investing in municipal obligations, the Fund may be susceptible to political, economic, regulatory or other factors affecting their issuers.Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk).
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
 The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index is an unmanaged index of short-term U.S. Government securities with a remaining term to final maturity of less than three months. The index is unmanaged and does not include any expenses, fees or sales charges. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Please consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the fund. To obtain a prospectus, download one at morganstanley.com/im
 
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.
 
 


 




 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order that
would allow Funds to operate as
actively-managed exchange traded
funds (‘‘ETFs’’).1 Fund shares will be
1 Applicants request that the order apply to the
initial Fund, as well as to future series of the Trust
and any future open-end management investment

Jkt 241001

purchased and redeemed at their NAV
in Creation Units only (other than
pursuant to a distribution reinvestment
program described in the application).
All orders to purchase Creation Units
and all redemption requests will be
placed by or through an ‘‘Authorized
Participant’’, which will have signed a
participant agreement with the
Distributor. Shares will be listed and
traded individually on a national
securities exchange, where share prices
will be based on the current bid/offer
market. Any order granting the
requested relief would be subject to the
terms and conditions stated in the
application.
2. Each Fund will consist of a
portfolio of securities and other assets
and investment positions (‘‘Portfolio
Instruments’’). Each Fund will disclose
on its Web site the identities and
quantities of the Portfolio Instruments
that will form the basis for the Fund’s
calculation of NAV at the end of the
day.
3. Shares will be purchased and
redeemed in Creation Units and
generally on an in-kind basis. Except
where the purchase or redemption will
include cash under the limited
circumstances specified in the
application, purchasers will be required
to purchase Creation Units by
depositing specified instruments
(‘‘Deposit Instruments’’), and
shareholders redeeming their shares
will receive specified instruments
(‘‘Redemption Instruments’’). The
Deposit Instruments and the
Redemption Instruments will each
correspond pro rata to the positions in
the Fund’s portfolio (including cash
positions) except as specified in the
application.
4. Because shares will not be
individually redeemable, applicants
request an exemption from section
5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the Act
that would permit the Funds to register
as open-end management investment
companies and issue shares that are
redeemable in Creation Units only.
5. Applicants also request an
exemption from section 22(d) of the Act
and rule 22c–1 under the Act as
secondary market trading in shares will
take place at negotiated prices, not at a
current offering price described in a
Fund’s prospectus, and not at a price
based on NAV. Applicants state that (a)
companies or series thereof (each, included in the
term ‘‘Fund’’), each of which will operate as an
actively-managed ETF. Any Fund will (a) be
advised by the Initial Adviser or an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the Initial Adviser (each, an
‘‘Adviser’’) and (b) comply with the terms and
conditions of the application.

secondary market trading in shares does
not involve a Fund as a party and will
not result in dilution of an investment
in shares, and (b) to the extent different
prices exist during a given trading day,
or from day to day, such variances occur
as a result of third-party market forces,
such as supply and demand. Therefore,
applicants assert that secondary market
transactions in shares will not lead to
discrimination or preferential treatment
among purchasers. Finally, applicants
represent that share market prices will
be disciplined by arbitrage
opportunities, which should prevent
shares from trading at a material
discount or premium from NAV.
6. With respect to Funds that hold
non-U.S. Portfolio Instruments and that
effect creations and redemptions of
Creation Units in kind, applicants
request relief from the requirement
imposed by section 22(e) in order to
allow such Funds to pay redemption
proceeds within fifteen calendar days
following the tender of Creation Units
for redemption. Applicants assert that
the requested relief would not be
inconsistent with the spirit and intent of
section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable,
undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the
actual payment of redemption proceeds.
7. Applicants request an exemption to
permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund
shares beyond the limits of section
12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds,
and any principal underwriter for the
Funds, and/or any broker or dealer
registered under the Exchange Act, to
sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond
the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the
Act. The application’s terms and
conditions are designed to, among other
things, help prevent any potential (i)
undue influence over a Fund through
control or voting power, or in
connection with certain services,
transactions, and underwritings, (ii)
excessive layering of fees, and (iii)
overly complex fund structures, which
are the concerns underlying the limits
in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the
Act.
8. Applicants request an exemption
from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the
Act to permit persons that are Affiliated
Persons, or Second-Tier Affiliates, of the
Funds, solely by virtue of certain
ownership interests, to effectuate
purchases and redemptions in-kind. The
deposit procedures for in-kind
purchases of Creation Units and the
redemption procedures for in-kind
redemptions of Creation Units will be
the same for all purchases and
redemptions and Deposit Instruments
and Redemption Instruments will be
valued in the same manner as those
Portfolio Instruments currently held by

the Funds. Applicants also seek relief
from the prohibitions on affiliated
transactions in section 17(a) to permit a
Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its
shares from a Fund of Funds, and to
engage in the accompanying in-kind
transactions with the Fund of Funds.2
The purchase of Creation Units by a
Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will
be accomplished in accordance with the
policies of the Fund of Funds and will
be based on the NAVs of the Funds.
9. Applicants also request relief to
permit a Feeder Fund to acquire shares
of another registered investment
company managed by the Adviser
having substantially the same
investment objectives as the Feeder
Fund (‘‘Master Fund’’) beyond the
limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A) and
permit the Master Fund, and any
principal underwriter for the Master
Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund
to the Feeder Fund beyond the
limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the
Commission to exempt any persons or
transactions from any provision of the
Act if such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act
provides that the Commission may
exempt any person, security, or
transaction, or any class or classes of
persons, securities, or transactions, from
any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the
Commission to grant an order
permitting a transaction otherwise
prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds
that (a) the terms of the proposed
transaction are fair and reasonable and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned; (b) the
proposed transaction is consistent with
the policies of each registered
investment company involved; and (c)
the proposed transaction is consistent
with the general purposes of the Act.
2 The requested relief would apply to direct sales
of shares in Creation Units by a Fund to a Fund of
Funds and redemptions of those shares. Applicants,
moreover, are not seeking relief from section 17(a)
for, and the requested relief will not apply to,
transactions where a Fund could be deemed an
Affiliated Person, or a Second-Tier Affiliate, of a
Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control
with an Adviser provides investment advisory
services to that Fund of Funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the

Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an 
applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Summary of the Application

    1. Applicants request an order that would allow Funds to operate as 
actively-managed exchange traded funds (``ETFs'').\1\ Fund shares will 
be purchased and redeemed at their NAV in Creation Units only (other 
than pursuant to a distribution reinvestment program described in the 
application). All orders to purchase Creation Units and all redemption 
requests will be placed by or through an ``Authorized Participant'', 
which will have signed a participant agreement with the Distributor. 
Shares will be listed and traded individually on a national securities 
exchange, where share prices will be based on the current bid/offer 
market. Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the 
terms and conditions stated in the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Applicants request that the order apply to the initial Fund, 
as well as to future series of the Trust and any future open-end 
management investment companies or series thereof (each, included in 
the term ``Fund''), each of which will operate as an actively-
managed ETF. Any Fund will (a) be advised by the Initial Adviser or 
an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with 
the Initial Adviser (each, an ``Adviser'') and (b) comply with the 
terms and conditions of the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Each Fund will consist of a portfolio of securities and other 
assets and investment positions (``Portfolio Instruments''). Each Fund 
will disclose on its Web site the identities and quantities of the 
Portfolio Instruments that will form the basis for the Fund's 
calculation of NAV at the end of the day.
    3. Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and 
generally on an in-kind basis. Except where the purchase or redemption 
will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the 
application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by 
depositing specified instruments (``Deposit Instruments''), and 
shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments 
(``Redemption Instruments''). The Deposit Instruments and the 
Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions 
in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified 
in the application.
    4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants 
request an exemption from section 5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the 
Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management 
investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation 
Units only.
    5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the 
Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares 
will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price 
described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. 
Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in shares does not 
involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an 
investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist 
during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as 
a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. 
Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in 
shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among 
purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will 
be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares 
from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.
    6. With respect to Funds that hold non-U.S. Portfolio Instruments 
and that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind, 
applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) 
in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen 
calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. 
Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent 
with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, 
undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption 
proceeds.
    7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to 
acquire Fund shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 
Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or 
any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act, to sell shares 
to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. 
The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other 
things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund 
through control or voting power, or in connection with certain 
services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of 
fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns 
underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
    8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 
17(a)(2) of the Act to permit persons that are Affiliated Persons, or 
Second-Tier Affiliates, of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain 
ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. 
The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the 
redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be 
the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instruments and 
Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those 
Portfolio Instruments currently held by

[[Page 892]]

the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on 
affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its 
shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in 
the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.\2\ The 
purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will 
be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds 
and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The requested relief would apply to direct sales of shares 
in Creation Units by a Fund to a Fund of Funds and redemptions of 
those shares. Applicants, moreover, are not seeking relief from 
section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, 
transactions where a Fund could be deemed an Affiliated Person, or a 
Second-Tier Affiliate, of a Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an 
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with an 
Adviser provides investment advisory services to that Fund of Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. Applicants also request relief to permit a Feeder Fund to 
acquire shares of another registered investment company managed by the 
Adviser having substantially the same investment objectives as the 
Feeder Fund (``Master Fund'') beyond the limitations in section 
12(d)(1)(A) and permit the Master Fund, and any principal underwriter 
for the Master Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund to the Feeder 
Fund beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
    10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any 
persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption 
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with 
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 
policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act 
provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or 
transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or 
transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption 
is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. 
Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order 
permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it 
finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and 
reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person 
concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies 
of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed 
transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
