What is Acorns?
Acorns is a financial service that helps you invest your money. We enable you to start early, invest often, and feel secure about your financial future. For more, check out how it works.


What am I investing in?
Acorns investment portfolios are composed of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). For more information about individual funds, what they contain, and why we selected them, please visit our Investments page.


How much does it cost to use Acorns?
Accounts under $5,000 pay only $1 per month. For accounts of $5,000 or more, pay 0.25% per year.


How do I add funds to my investment portfolio?
Once your account is approved, simply open up the app, go to the "Invest/Withdraw" screen. Enter the amount and click "Invest".


How do Round-Ups work?
When you link a credit or debit card to your Acorns account, we track the spare change from your transactions and make it available for you to invest. Simply choose what you would like to invest, or change your settings to automatically invest round-ups after each purchase.

What's a portfolio?






Define "Portfolio"
A portfolio is a select combination of investments, often stocks or bonds that you own.










Stocks & Bonds
Stocks are shares of ownership in a business. Bonds are a debt investment where an investor loans money to a business or government for a defined period of time and interest rate.










How to Create a Portfolio
To create a portfolio, tell us your financial situation and goals. With those answers, Acorns will recommend you a mix of ETFs that will become your portfolio.





What am I investing in?






Exchange Traded Funds
ETFs for short, are made up of broad holdings of stocks or bonds. Often, these ETFs replicate an asset class or index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average.










Asset Classes
Asset classes represent certain categories or classes of stocks or bonds. Each ETF represents an asset class in your portfolio ranging from Large Companies to Real Estate.
Find and read our ETF prospectuses here.










Diversification is Key
When you invest in several different asset classes, it helps to smooth out any bumps when the market changes.










Today's Top Companies
Every dollar you invest is automatically diversified over 7,000 stocks & bonds. This is all possible due to Fractional Share Ownership in our portfolio ETFs.

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Acorns, the first app to help people save and invest in micro increments, today announced its launch on Amazon Fire Phone, expanding access beyond the App Store and Google Play. The company will demonstrate the app functionalities on-stage at this year's Money 20/20, the world's largest event for payments and financial services innovation. The improved reach and accessibility speaks to the company's ongoing commitment to help young people more conveniently save, invest and build wealth in the background of life.
"At Acorns, we're constantly seeking ways to enhance the user experience and find new ways to help younger generations jumpstart investing – something millennials have historically put off for later in life," said Jeff Cruttenden, cofounder and COO of Acorns. "We've emphasized a mobile-first approach to our platform and financial engine, and the Fire phone is a natural next step in making Acorns available to a wider audience."
In addition to launching on Amazon Fire, Acorns also recently enabled TouchID to help iPhone users easily gain access to their accounts with Apple's fingerprint recognition technology. The app is fully functional with iOS 8 and the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.  
To invest with Acorns, visit iTunes, Google Play, Amazon or Acorns.
About Acorns Grow Inc.Acorns is the first true micro investing company, allowing people to round up purchases and automatically invest the change®. The Acorns app and financial engine were built to help people micro invest commission-free into a diversified portfolio of index funds offered by the world's largest asset managers: Vanguard, Blackrock, and PIMCO. Customers accumulate fractional shares, automatically saving and investing small amounts of money frequently. The app can also help identify and gather found money, such as rebates and rewards, which can be automatically swept into the customer's investment account. Like the alarm app that helps you wake, and the calendar app that helps you keep appointments, Acorns works behind the scenes, saving and investing pennies at a time, so you don't have to. From Acorns mighty oaks do grow!
Acorns Grow Inc. (d/b/a/Acorns) is the parent of Acorns Securities LLC, a member of FINRA and SIPC, and Acorns Advisers LLC, an SEC registered investment adviser.
This is not an offer or a solicitation to buy or sell securities. Investing involves risk. Investments are not FDIC or NCUA insured. Projections are hypothetical in nature. Brokerage services are provided to Acorns Advisers LLC by Acorns Securities LLC, member of FINRA/SIPC.

With 7,000 attendees, including more than 600 CEOs, from over 2,250 companies and 60 countries, Money20/20 is critical to realizing the vision of disruptive ways in which consumers and businesses manage, spend and borrow money.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

History[edit]
Acorns was founded by Jeff Cruttenden and his father, Walter Cruttenden in 2012. Walter was an investment banker and had previously founded and served as CEO of Roth Capital Partners and e-offering, an investment banking firm.[7] Jeffrey with his father worked on creating a mobile app for first-time investors to invest small automated investments from a bank account into diversified portfolios.[8] Within less than two years of launch, Acorns opened nearly 1 million investment accounts.[9] In May 2016, the company launched Found Money, through which retail partners like Jet.com, 1-800-Flowers, Dollar Shave Club, JackThreads and Hotel Tonight invest money into Acorns users’ accounts when they shop with the brands.[10][3] Acorns Grow Inc. is the parent of Acorns Securities LLC, a member of FINRA and SIPC, and Acorns Advisers LLC, an SEC registered investment adviser.[11][4]
The startup gained some traction and as of 31 March 2016, the company has 850,000 investment accounts with more than $150 million invested.[5][12] It charges a $1 monthly fee for accounts with investments under $5,000, and charges 0.25% per year for accounts larger than $5,000.[8][6]
Product[edit]
The application links with the user’s bank account, which automatically rounds up the transactions to the nearest dollar and withdraws the spare change to invest into seven exchange-traded funds (ETFs).[11][13] Customers accumulate fractional shares in one of five portfolios constructed by economist Dr. Harry Markowitz.[5][2] The application allows users to set up one-time investments or daily, weekly or monthly recurring investments.[14][15] As of May, 2017 the following ETFs are offered by Acorns to invest through their service:

Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF (VOO)
Vanguard Small Cap Index ETF (VB)
Vanguard Emerging Markets FTSE Index ETF (VWO)
Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA)
Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)
BlackRock iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD)
BlackRock iShares 1-3 Treasury Bond ETF (SHY)

.
Funding rounds[edit]
As of 2016, Acorns has raised more than $60 million from investors including Paypal,[16] Rakuten Fintech Fund, Sound Venture, Greycroft Partners, Capital Group, e.ventures, Liberty Media and others.[17][18]

Series A funding of $2.5 Million in July 2013 led by Steelpoint Capital Partners.[19]
Series B funding of $5.5 Million in March 2014 led by Jacobs Asset Management, with participation from clients of Digital Offering.
Series C funding of $23 Million in April 2015 co-led by Greycroft Partners and e.ventures, with participation from Sound Venture, Garland Capital, and MATH Venture Partners.[20][17]
Series D funding of $30 Million in April 2016 with participation from PayPal, Rakuten Fintech Fund, e.ventures and Greycroft Partners.[1]

History[edit]
Acorns was founded by Jeff Cruttenden and his father, Walter Cruttenden in 2012. Walter was an investment banker and had previously founded and served as CEO of Roth Capital Partners and e-offering, an investment banking firm.[7] Jeffrey with his father worked on creating a mobile app for first-time investors to invest small automated investments from a bank account into diversified portfolios.[8] Within less than two years of launch, Acorns opened nearly 1 million investment accounts.[9] In May 2016, the company launched Found Money, through which retail partners like Jet.com, 1-800-Flowers, Dollar Shave Club, JackThreads and Hotel Tonight invest money into Acorns users’ accounts when they shop with the brands.[10][3] Acorns Grow Inc. is the parent of Acorns Securities LLC, a member of FINRA and SIPC, and Acorns Advisers LLC, an SEC registered investment adviser.[11][4]
