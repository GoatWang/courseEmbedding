Mr. Wood, 52, is the chief executive and president of Federal Realty Investment Trust in Rockville, Md., which owns and operates shopping centers.Mr. Wood joined the company in 1998 as chief financial officer. He became chief operating officer in 1999 and chief executive in 2002.Interview conducted and condensed by  VIVIAN MARINOQ. What changes have you made at Federal Realty over the last nearly 10 years? A. Our company has always been all about high-quality retail real estate, but we had lost our way a bit in the ’90s and my job was really to come in and settle things back down. It was to bring us back to basics. We sold, we bought, we built.

We had purchased in the ’90s a lot of smaller buildings, and I sold a lot of those buildings to concentrate on larger pieces of real estate. Continue reading the main story

Q. What’s the average size of property in your portfolio? A. The average strip shopping center in this country is 125,000 square feet, and what that usually means is a grocer that’s 40,000 or 50,000 and a CVS or Walgreen’s that’s 15,000 or 20,000, and small shops.The average Federal Realty center is over 230,000 square feet.Q. How do you categorize your property over all? A. The best real estate portfolio in the country. We have more people within three miles of Federal Realty shopping centers, who have higher household incomes and with the least amount of retail per capita.Q. So upscale strip mall? A. I’m not going there.People love to ask: Is it a strip center? Or a grocer-anchored strip? Is it a mall? Is it a power center?I don’t care. You know who doesn’t care what you call them? Customers who are simply trying to find the retail that works for them and tenants who are looking for the right kind of storefront and environment.Some of our property includes street retail with apartments on top, offices on top, a hotel in the middle. You’d see power centers with a big Bed Bath & Beyond, a PetSmart and a Dick’s Sporting Goods.I would call them hybrid centers.Q. The company seems to be moving more toward mixed-use developments.

A. It is. We were one of the first companies to do mixed-use back in the ’90s, and we learned a lot. We didn’t do it all that well at certain times. But when you look at what is sustainable in terms of people’s lifestyle, mixed-use can work real well. It has to be in the right place.We’ve got large mixed-use projects in San Jose, Calif.; the Silicon Valley; in Bethesda, Md.; and we’re building one outside Boston called Assembly Row.

Q. What percentage of your property is in the New York area? A. Not nearly enough from my perspective. It’s only about 10 percent of the company.Q. So is expansion in the New York area one of your goals? A. Yeah, it is, particularly in northern New Jersey and Westchester. A year ago we bought another property in Huntington, called Huntington Square. We’re now in the middle of a major redevelopment at Huntington Shopping Center, which is next to Simon’s Walt Whitman mall. We’re looking to redevelop Fresh Meadows in Queens. We have a building in Forest Hills.

We have a hit list, and for us it’s not about what’s for sale. It’s about what we’d like to own and then working with those owners for years and years and years. We have a hit list that’s over 700 props nationally. One of the reasons I’m up here now is to look at a property in northern New Jersey.Q. So do you expand mostly through acquisitions, as opposed to new development? A. We do both. We’ve developed 20 percent and acquired 80 percent over the last 50 years.Q. How many deals or projects do you have in the pipeline? A. To me every lease is a deal. We do about 330 deals — leases — a year. Every year: about 1.2 million square feet of new or renewals. That’s always giving us an opportunity to create more value.Q. How would you describe your tenant mix? A. No one tenant makes up more than 2.8 percent of our revenue stream. We don’t want anybody to be overly dominant in our portfolio. We’re diversified geographically and by product type.Q. You do have a number of high-end retailers like Gucci. A. We’re more upper-middle, so it’s the Anthropologies, Urban Outfitters, Diesels; and then the necessity base, the grocers, the drugstores, the fitness clubs. And mom-and-pop stores.

Q. Let’s talk numbers now. A. We’re over 94 percent leased. We’d been as high as 96 percent, in 2004-5, and as low as 92 percent, three years ago.If you look at the last five years, the best of times were in 2007; the worst of times were in 2008 and ’09; and then purgatory ever since.Our average rent per square foot is over $20. The market value is nearly $30. As leases expire, we generally roll rents up.Average lease length is seven years, but there are a lot of fives and fifteens. Anchors are longer — they’re 15, 20 or more.Q. How much debt does Federal Realty have on its properties, on average? A. Thirty percent debt, 70 percent equity.Q. Where would you like to take the company in the next five to 10 years? A. I love the trend that we’re on.I also want to be the most boring guy in the business. I want people to think, Oh we know Federal’s results are going to be great and that Federal’s properties are going to do well. We don’t need to check on Wood; he’s so boring.I truly want to be Mr. Boring. And I think we’ve gotten there.

 Correction: October 5, 2012  
The 30-Minute Interview column on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday, about Donald C. Wood, chief executive of the shopping center operator Federal Realty Investment Trust, misstated a business typical to the company’s shopping properties. Federal Realty’s shopping centers typically include a CVS or a Walgreen’s, but not a Walmart.
