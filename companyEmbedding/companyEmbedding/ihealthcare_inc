The above figures represent only estimated costs for the next 12 months.

Collectively, the Company’s officers and directors will pay for all expenses
incurred in this offering.


While we offer what we feel to be the most efficient and cost effective drug
screening product on the market today, we do face intense competition from other
Companies who offer similar products.

Competing one step products (meaning one device with multiple drug screening
panels) include the following: DrugConfirm Advanced [10 panel]; AmeriCup [12
panel]; ECO II [10 panel]; CLIA Screen [12 panel]; T-Cup [10 panel]; EZ Split
Key Cup [10 panel]; CentralCheck [11 panel]; NxStep [12 panel]; and others.

We believe the UDT Cup we offer to customers differs from most other drug
screening products on the market and may serve as a better alternative to many
such products due to the fact that it can provide test results in a lesser
amount of time, one minute versus four to ten minutes for most competing
products. Additionally, the UDT Cup has an internal seal that may prevent cross
contamination of the urine sample when shaken or jostled during testing. This is
a feature that most other competing drug screening kits do not have. The UDT
Cup’s design is also designed in a way that can make it more suitable for use
among both males and females. This however, is our own opinion. The UDT Cup also
comes standard with a temperature strip included as part of the kit, something
most other drug screening kits offer but only as an “add on feature” for an
additional cost.

	250,000
	SHARES OF COMMON STOCK






	$0.0001
	PAR VALUE PER SHARE





	 





	Prior
	to this Offering, no public market has existed for the common stock of Ihealthcare, Inc.  Upon completion of
	this Offering, we will attempt to have the shares quoted on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group. There is no assurance that the Shares will ever be quoted on the OTCQB. To be quoted on the
	OTCQB, a market maker must apply to make a market in our common stock.  As of the date of this Prospectus, we have not
	made any arrangement with any market makers to quote our shares.






	 






	We
	are offering 250,000 shares of our common stock for sale in this prospectus. All of the proceeds of this offering will go
	directly to the company.  The offering is being made on a self-underwritten, “best efforts” basis. 
	There is no minimum number of shares required to be purchased by each investor. The shares offered by the Company will
	be sold on our behalf by our Chief Executive Officer, Noel Mijares.  He will not receive any commissions or proceeds
	for selling the shares on our behalf.  All of the shares being registered for sale by the Company will be sold at a
	fixed price per share of $0.25 for the duration of the Offering. Assuming all of the 250,000 shares being offered by the
	Company are sold, the Company will receive $62,500 in gross proceeds.  There is no minimum amount we are required to
	raise from the shares being offered by the Company and any funds received will be immediately available to us.  There is
	no guarantee that this Offering will successfully raise enough funds to institute our company’s business plan.
	Additionally, there is no guarantee that a public market will ever develop and you may be unable to sell your
	shares.






	 






	This primary offering will
	automatically terminate upon the earliest of (i) such time as all of the common stock has been sold pursuant to the registration
	statement or (ii) 365 days from the effective date of this Prospectus, unless extended by our directors for an additional 90 days.
	We may however, at our discretion terminate the offering at any time.





	 





	In their audit report dated
	February 17, 2016, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

	The Company






	 





	The
	Company was originally incorporated with the name Opulent Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November
	25, 2014 with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business.




	 








	On
	January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the sole shareholder of the Company, transferred to Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida
	Company, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of
	transfer, in consideration of $25,000. The transfer was the result of the sale of the Company to Ihealthcare, Inc., the
	Florida Company.




	 




	On
	January 14, 2016 Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of
	Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the time of the sale of Opulent Acquisition, Inc., Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned
	37.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.




	 




	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer
	and Director.




	 




	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. Noel Mijares was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and President.




	 




	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. David A. Bingaman was appointed as Chief Operating Officer, Vice President, and Secretary.




	 












	On
	April 22, 2016 we, Opulent Acquisition, Inc. (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware”) entered into and consummated a merger
	with Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida”). Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware is the Surviving
	Corporation as result of the merger. The officers and directors of Opulent Acquisition, Inc., now known as Ihealthcare, Inc.,
	remained the same and unchanged. Our officers and directors continue to serve their respective positions with the Company.

	The aforementioned merger was treated as a reverse merger between the two entities, both of which were, and still are, under
	common control.



	 



	Previous to the Merger Noel Mijares owned 6,250
	shares of common stock of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company and David A Bingaman owned 3,750 shares of common stock of Ihealthcare,
	Inc., the Florida Company. After the merger each one of these shares were converted into 100 shares of our common stock (Ihealthcare,
	Inc., a Delaware Company, formerly known as Opulent Acquistion, Inc). The 20,000,000 shares of common stock owned by Ihealthcare,
	Inc., a Florida Company of Ihealthcare, Inc., formerly known as Opulent Acquistion Inc., a Delaware Company were cancelled upon
	consummation of the merger.


	 


	Currently, Noel Mijares owns
	625,000 shares of our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our
	common stock.



	 



	On
	April 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation,
	changing its name to Ihealthcare, Inc.


	 


	On
	May 13, 2016 David A. Bingaman was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Director.


	 


	On July 25, 2016 we, Ihealthcare, Inc.,
	organized Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company. The members of the LLC include Ihealthcare, Inc., and
	All in 1 Medical, LLC. Each of the aforementioned parties own 50% of the membership interests in Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC. All
	in 1 Medical, LLC is owned and operated by Mark Heffner, who is a non-affiliate of Ihealthcare, Inc.


	 


	As of August 31, 2016 Ihealthcare Surgical,
	LLC has not had any monetary transactions. Per the above the Company has applied ASC 323 for presentation and disclosure requirements.
	Because Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC conducted no monetary business as of August 31, 2016 there were no transactions recorded on
	the books for the period.


	 


	On August 19, 2016 Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, entered
	into and consummated a joint venture agreement with All In 1 Medical, LLC. The purpose of the joint venture agreement is to forge
	a relationship that through means, which will be determined at a future date, will bring together both parties in an effort to
	sell, to be determined, medical products. Each party retains a 50% interest in the joint venture. Each party has also agreed to
	split profits and expenses equally that relate to the joint venture. The term of the joint venture agreement is through August
	4, 2026. It may be renewed for an additional five year term if agreed upon by both parties. Each party of the joint venture agreement
	has agreed to contribute $500 for business purposes set forth in the joint venture agreement. Neither party has, as of the date
	of this report, contributed the $500, however both parties intend to make such contribution after a joint bank account is opened
	up for the purpose of the joint venture.


	 


	On October 3, 2016 Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC entered
	into and consummated an agreement with Precision Spine, Inc., “Precision,” to act as Precision’s sales agent
	in regards to the sale of spinal implants and other medical products that are manufactured for or by Precision. Ihealthcare, Inc.
	is to receive a 40% commission on the sale of spinal implants for the fourth quarter of 2016 and effective January of 2017, 35%,
	+5% each quarter if Ihealthcare is able to generate sales of $300,000 or more in a quarterly period. For “Biologic”
	products as they are categorized in the agreement, Ihealthcare will receive a to be decided upon commission that is agreed upon
	by both parties at a later date. Regarding disposable single use instruments, Ihealthcare, Inc. will receive a 20% commission
	for any sales generated on Precision’s behalf.


	 




	On October 10, 2016 our subsidiary, iHealthcare Surgical, LLC
	entered into an agreement with Gensano, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement iHealthcare Surgical, LLC will act as a sales agent
	for Gensano, LLC by attempting to sell products on their behalf. In this agreement iHealthcare Surgical, LLC will receive a sales
	commission which will be comprised of the difference between the price of Gensano’s products and the actual cost at which
	iHealthcare Surgical manages to sell the products. Gensano has set a fixed cost, per product, that they must receive from the
	sale of each item. IHealthcare Surgical, LLC will not directly purchase products from Gensano, and all shipping will be conducted
	directly from Gensano to the customer.











	 




	Our
	principal executive offices are located at 3901 NW 28th Street, 2nd Floor, Miami, FL 33142.

	In their audit
	report dated February 17, 2016, our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can
	continue as an ongoing business. Because officers and directors may be unwilling or
	unable to loan or advance any additional capital to us, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our
	business plan.

	The Company is electing

	to compare to other companies.





	 





	Pursuant to the JOBS Act
	of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised
	accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition
	period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
	the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company’s
	financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS






	 




	For our (Ihealthcare, Inc., FKA Opulent Acquistion, Inc.)
	fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 we did not generate any revenues. We had no cash and or cash equivalents as of our fiscal
	year end. Our net loss was $7,496 and was attributable to professional fees and related operating expenses.




	 



	Pursuant
	to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Agreement”) dated April 22, 2016


	 


	,
	by and between, Ihealthcare, Inc. a Florida Corporation (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida”), and Opulent Acquisition, Inc.,
	a Delaware Corporation, (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware” or the “Surviving Corporation), jointly the (“Constituent
	Corporations”) effective as of April 22, 2016


	 


	,
	Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida merged with and into Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware with Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware continuing as the Surviving
	Corporation.



	 


	The board of directors of the Constituent Corporations
	declared the Merger Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Constituent Corporations and have approved the
	Merger.


	 


	Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company was a “shell
	company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
	Act”).


	 


	As of the effective date of the Merger, we the Company,
	Ihealthcare, Inc., “FKA Opulent Acquisition” have adopted the business plan of what was Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida,
	which is the sale of goods in the healthcare sector. We currently have a distribution agreement with Innovate Laboratory Solutions,
	also known as “ILS” to supply us a product known as the “UDT Cup” (also herein known as Multi-Panel [16]
	urinalysis cup or Drug of Abuse “DOA” Cup). ILS has agreed to provide us the right to purchase the UDT Cup at special
	pricing in certain quantities. ILS is the developer of the UDT Cup and exclusive global supplier of the UDT Cup, however they
	have the UDT Cup manufactured by a third party manufacturer of which they have not and will not disclose to us due to confidentiality.
	ILS does however, have the authority and right to control who manufactures the UDT Cup.




	 


	We have begun conducting sales of the UDT Cup, but our
	sales have been minimal. Our plans relating to this can be found in the above section titled, “Business.”


	 


	We believe we need to develop a more concrete marketing
	plan so that we can sell the goods on a large scale (to more than one consumer from time to time). We also believe we need to
	hire additional staff of which we have begun to do so. To date we have hired what we refer to as an “SVP of Operations.”
	This individual is responsible for formulating our marketing plan moving forward, amending it as seen fit, contacting and facilitating
	relationships with potential wholesalers and overseeing any other sales employees we currently have or may hire in the future.
	Currently we have two sales team members that are commission based.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015 Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida
	Company had cash and or cash equivalents in the amount of $100. From inception through December 31, 2015, the Company had no revenues
	and a net loss of $3,000 attributable to professional fees and related expenses. As of the fiscal year end the Company had received
	$25,200 for common stock issued of which $25,000 was deposited into escrow for the purchase of Opulent Acquistion, Inc., a Delaware
	Company.


	 


	We believe that to develop the Company’s current
	business plan that we must raise capital in the next twelve months. The Company has no immediate plans to raise such capital.
	Thus far the Company has relied solely on funds provided by our officers and directors, Noel Mijares, our Chief Executive officer,
	President, Director and David A. Bingaman, our Chief Operating Officer, Vice President, and Secretary. If we can not raise such
	funds we will have to continue to rely on funds provided to us by our officers and directors.


	 



	For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and
	2015:



	We had revenue in the three month period ending August
	31, 2016 of $619 and $0 for the three month period ending August 31, 2015. Our operating expenses totaled $11,235 and $1,250,
	respectively. Our operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees for both periods. The variance in operating expenses
	is due to the fact that there have been increased professional fees for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as opposed to the
	same period the year prior. Our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was $10,901 and was $1,250 for the three months
	ended August 31, 2015.



	For the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and
	2015:



	We had revenue in the nine month period ending August
	31, 2016 of $619 and $0 for the nine month period ending August 31, 2015. Our operating expenses totaled $40,561 and $4,550, respectively.
	Our operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees for both periods. The variance in operating expenses is due to
	the fact that there have been increased professional fees for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as opposed to the same period
	the year prior. Our net loss for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $40,227 and was $4,550 for the nine months ended August
	31, 2015. 


	We believe that to develop the Company’s current business
	plan that we must raise capital in the next twelve months. The Company has no immediate plans to raise such capital outside
	of this offering. Thus far the Company has relied solely on funds provided by our officers and directors, Noel Mijares, our
	Chief Executive officer and David A. Bingaman, our Chief Operating Officer. If we cannot raise such funds we will have to continue
	to rely on funds provided to us by our officers and directors.

	RISK
	FACTORS






	 




	Please consider the following
	risk factors and other information in this prospectus relating to our business before deciding to invest in our common stock.




	 




	This offering and any investment
	in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information
	contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur,
	our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline
	due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.




	 




	We consider the following
	to be the material risks for an investor regarding this offering. Our company should be viewed as a high-risk investment and speculative
	in nature. An investment in our common stock may result in a complete loss of the invested amount.




	 




	An investment
	in our common stock is highly speculative, and should only be made by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in
	us. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this report before deciding to become a
	holder of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be negatively
	affected to a significant extent.




	 






	Risks
	Relating to Our Company and Our Industry






	 






	We will require additional funds in the future to achieve our
	current business strategy and our inability to obtain funding will cause our business to fail.



	 


	We will need to raise additional funds through public or private
	debt or equity sales in order to fund our future. These financings may not be available when needed. Even if these financings are
	available, it may be on terms that we deem unacceptable or are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of
	book value, dividend preferences, liquidation preferences, or other terms. Our inability to obtain financing would have an adverse
	effect on our ability to implement our current business plan and develop our product line, and as a result, could require us to
	diminish or suspend our operations and possibly cease our existence.


	 


	Even if we are successful in raising capital in the future we will
	likely need to raise additional capital to continue and/or expand our operations. If we do not raise the additional capital, the
	value of any investment in our Company may become worthless. In the event we do not raise additional capital from conventional
	sources, it is likely that we may need to scale back or curtail implementing our business plan.



	 






	As
	of our most recent quarter end we had minimal cash and/or cash equivalents. As a result of having minimal cash to fund our business
	we have, and continue to be, primarily reliant upon our Officers and Directors to fund our operations. We believe our officers
	and directors will continue to fund our operations for a period of twelve months although there is no guarantee that they will
	do so.



	 




	We
	have generated only minimal revenues to date since our inception. Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey,
	LLP has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report in regards to our operations.





	 




	In
	their audit report our PCAOB auditor MaloneBailey, LLP issued a going concern opinion in regards to our operations. The going
	concern was issued due to the fact we have suffered a net loss and do not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operations
	which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue. The going concern issued by our independent auditor may have a negative
	impact on the value of our common stock, although the extent of this negative impact is not known at this time. Additionally,
	we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing as a result of the going concern.



	 


	We are a start-up stage company. Our ability to continue as a going
	concern is dependent upon our ability to commence a commercially viable operation and to achieve profitability. Since our inception
	we have generated minimal revenues, and currently have only limited operations, as we are presently in the planning stage
	of our business development as an exploration stage company. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
	as a going concern. We may not be able to generate revenues in the future and as a result the value of our common stock may become
	worthless. There are no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional capital or successfully developing and commercializing
	our products and becoming profitable.


	 



	We hold the distribution rights to the UDT Cup, but we rely
	on the services of a third party supplier (ILS) in order to supply the products we offer for sale. ILS has the right
	to control who manufacturers the product, the UDT Cup, which we offer for resale.




	 



	Due to the fact that we rely upon ILS in order to supply the UDT
	Cups which our company is currently selling we face inherent risks due to the fact that we do not hold the patents or manufacturing
	rights to the product. If there is a disruption in the supply of UDT Cups caused by any number of situations which could arise
	with ILS, then we may have difficulty successfully implementing our business plan or meeting the demand for our products when
	we have commenced operations. These disruptions could include, but are not strictly limited to, shipping difficulties or setbacks,
	price increases which would require renegotiation of terms, manufacturing difficulties on the part of ILS, etc. Additionally,
	should ILS go out of business then we will be forced to find an alternative product for sale, and an alternative manufacturer,
	which could delay our business operations substantially or force us to cease operations entirely.


	 



	ILS is solely responsible for the shipping of the UDT
	Cups.




	 



	We will not be responsible for shipping the UDT Cups to any consumers.
	ILS is solely responsible for shipping the UDT Cups and any disruptions or hold ups in relation to the shipping of the UDT
	Cups could cause a disruption that will negatively impact our operations. Consumers may lose faith in our ability to have UDT Cups
	reliably shipped through situations that are beyond our control.


	 



	Due to the fact that we do not have a concrete advertising plan
	we may not see the sales we anticipate if our advertising plan is not as effective as we plan.




	 



	We are in the planning stages of our advertising strategy, and as
	such we do not have a definitive plan for how we will conduct our marketing efforts. We plan to utilize internet media outlets,
	and social media, but our plans need to be further developed before we can begin implementing them fully. As such, we may see fewer
	sales than we anticipate if our marketing plan, once implemented, is not as effective as we plan.


	 




	We
	cannot identify the manufacturer of the UDT Cup.





	 




	Due
	to our agreement with ILS, whereby they provide and will continue to provide us with UDT Cups, they have withheld the name of
	the manufacturer of the UDT Cup. ILS acts as the distributor who supplies us with physical inventory. Due to the fact that we
	have no means through which we can identify the manufacturer there are inherent related risks. We rely on ILS to verify that the
	manufacturer complies with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to a manufacturer of a medical device and we can not directly
	verify this ourselves. While we do not believe we are subject to any potential product liability, because we believe that it will
	be either the manufacturer or ILS who will be responsible for product liability, we cannot accurately assess the manufacturer’s
	financial ability to compensate us for any potential liabilities related to the product.

	Our growth strategy is untested, unproven, and as of this point
	in time not fully developed.




	 



	We intend to grow our business starting in the South Eastern States
	of the United States, and from there spread outward into the North and eventually westward until we spread throughout the entire
	Country, at which point we will begin exploring international options. However, our exact strategy for how we will grow in this
	manner is currently in development, alongside our marketing plan, and we can offer no assurances that we will be effective in growing
	at the rate we anticipate, which could result in lower profit margins, if any.


	 



	We have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate
	us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
	that we may encounter because we are a small developing company. As a result, we may not be profitable and we may not be able to
	generate sufficient revenue to develop as we have planned.



	 


	We have only recently adopted a bona fide business plan. We have
	limited financial resources and limited assets. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses and difficulties
	in development of a customer base nationally, attaining and retaining customers and obtaining financing to meet the needs of our
	plan of operations. Since we have a limited operating history we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate sufficient
	revenues to meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities.



	 




	We are an early stage company with an unproven business strategy
	and may never be able to fully implement our business plan or achieve profitability.



	 


	We are at an early stage of development of our operations as a
	company. We have only recently started to operate business activities, and have generated minimal revenue from such operations.
	A commitment of substantial resources to conduct time-consuming research in many respects will be required if we are to complete
	the development of our company into one that is more profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully implement
	our business plan at reasonable costs or successfully operate. We expect it will take several years to implement our business
	plan fully, if at all.



	 




	Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately
	forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses.



	 


	We have a very limited operating history. As a result, it is difficult
	to accurately forecast our net sales and plan our operating expenses. This inability could cause our net income, if there is any
	income at all, in a given quarter to be lower than expected.


	 



	We operate in a highly competitive environment, and if we are
	unable to compete with our competitors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could
	be materially adversely affected.



	 


	We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition
	includes all other companies that are in the business of the drug screening market. A highly competitive environment could materially
	adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.


	 



	Because we are small and do not have much capital, our marketing
	campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient customers to operate profitably. If we do not make a profit, we will suspend or
	cease operations.



	 


	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must
	limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting
	our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably,
	we may have to suspend or cease operations.


	 



	We expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate.



	 


	We expect our net sales and operating results to vary significantly
	from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including unexpected changes in:


	 


	• Demand for our drug screening product(s);


	• Our ability to obtain new, and retain existing,
	customers;


	• Our ability to manage our services;


	• General economic conditions;


	• Advertising and other marketing costs.


	 


	As a result of the variability of these and other factors, our operating
	results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.

	Our future success is dependent on our implementation of our
	business plan. We have many significant steps still to take.



	 


	Our success will depend on large part in our success in achieving
	several important steps in the implementation of our business plan, including the following: acquiring business information, development
	of a customer base, development of relationships with consumers, and management of business process. If we are not successful,
	we will not be able to fully implement or expand our business plan. 


	 



	Our growth will place significant strains on our resources.



	 


	The Company is currently in the exploration stage, with only limited
	operations, and has generated only minimal revenue since inception. The Company's growth, if any, is expected to place
	a significant strain on the Company's managerial, operational and financial resources. Moving forward, the Company's systems,
	procedures or controls may not be adequate to support the Company's operations and/or the Company may be unable to achieve the
	rapid execution necessary to successfully implement its business plan. If the Company is unable to manage growth effectively,
	the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.


	 



	Our future success is dependent, in part, on the performance
	and continued services of Noel Mijares, our Chief Executive Officer as well as David A. Bingaman our Chief
	Operating Officer. Without their continued service, we may be forced to interrupt or eventually
	cease our operations.



	 


	We are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience,
	abilities and continued services of both Noel Mijares and David A. Bingaman. The loss of either of their services would delay our
	business operations substantially.


	 






	Our
	President and CEO, Noel Mijares is also the President and CEO of Pharma Health Corp., Unisources Discovery and The Subpoena Company.
	Mr. Mijares’s other business interests may result in him being unable to devote enough hours to the Company to further advance
	operations.





	 




	Our
	President and CEO, Noel Mijares is also the President and CEO of Pharma Health Corp., Unisources Discovery and The Subpoena Company.
	Mr. Mijares’s other business interests may result in him being unable to devote enough hours to the Company to further advance
	operations. Despite Mr. Noel Mijares’s other business ventures he believes he is still able to devote 40 hours per
	week to the Company’s operations however, there is the possibility that he may not be able to do so. If this were to occur
	it could negatively impact our operations and could cause our results of operations to suffer as a result.




	 





	Due
	to Article IX of our Certificate of Incorporation investors may have difficulty bringing any action against us in a judicial forum.





	 




	Article
	IX of our Certificate of Incorporation states that “unless we, the “Company” also referred to herein as “the
	Corporation” consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
	shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought
	on behalf of the corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by,
	any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation’s stockholders, (3) any
	action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law or the corporation’s Restated
	Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the corporation’s
	Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (5) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
	in each such case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants
	therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall
	be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX. Due to this provision, if a shareholder does not
	reside in Delaware then they may face difficulty bringing any action against us in a judicial forum due to the fact that all such
	claims must be made in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In addition to the potential inconvenience of physical
	location, shareholders may find this choice of forum inconvenient for any number of reasons which are subjective to the shareholder(s).
	This exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable
	for disputes. This may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against the company and its officers, directors or other
	employees.



	 



	The recently enacted JOBS Act will allow the Company to postpone
	the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information
	provided in reports filed with the SEC.



	 


	The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory
	burden on “emerging growth companies”. The Company meets the definition of an “emerging growth company”
	and so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” it will, among other things:


	 


	-be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its
	internal control over financial reporting;


	 


	-be exempt from the "say on pay” provisions (requiring
	a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the "say on golden parachute”
	provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in
	connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
	(the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of Chief
	Executive Officers;


	 


	-be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis
	from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)
	and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and


	 


	-be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s
	report on the financial statements.



	 

	 


	Although the Company is still evaluating the JOBS Act, it currently
	intends to take advantage of all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it
	qualifies as an “emerging growth company”. The Company has elected not to opt out of the extension of time to comply
	with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this
	means that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on
	the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth
	company”, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go
	undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company”, the Company may elect not to provide
	certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers,
	which would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and
	securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common
	stock may be adversely affected.


	 


	Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller
	reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary
	of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues
	of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller
	reporting company”, at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required
	to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging
	growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”. Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”,
	“smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are
	exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting
	firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased
	disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited
	financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth
	company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company’s results
	of operations and financial prospects.

	Table of Contents






	 



	We are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS
	Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make
	our common stock less attractive to investors.



	 


	We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the
	JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
	companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with
	the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
	compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory
	vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict
	if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common
	stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more
	volatile.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging
	growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the
	adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take
	advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial
	statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.


	 


	We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to
	five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible
	debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million. 















	 






	Risks
	Relating to the Company’s Securities






	 





	We
	may never have a public market for our common stock or may never trade on a recognized exchange. Therefore, you may be unable
	to liquidate your investment in our stock.





	 




	There
	is no established public trading market for our securities. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange
	or quotation system.




	 




	In order
	for our shares to be quoted, a market maker must agree to file the necessary documents with the National Association of Securities
	Dealers, which operates the OTCBB. In addition, it is possible that such application for quotation may not be approved and even
	if approved it is possible that a regular trading market will not develop or that if it did develop, will be sustained. In the
	absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment.




	 





	We may,
	in the future, issue additional shares of our common stock, which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.






	 







	Our Certificate
	of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 143,500,000 shares of common stock, of which 1,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding
	as of November 23, 2016. The future issuance of our common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common
	shares held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance
	of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the
	shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.




	 





	We
	may issue shares of preferred stock in the future that may adversely impact your rights as holders of our common stock.





	 




	Our Certificate
	of Incorporation authorizes us to issue

	6,500,000 shares of Series A and 5,000,000 Series B Preferred Stock. Each holder
	Preferred B Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of held of record by such holder and each holder of Series A
	Preferred Stock shall have the right to one hundred (100) votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock. Currently, we have no shares
	of preferred stock outstanding, however the issuance of any of our preferred stock may influence the value of your investment.


	 



	We

	do
	not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment
	will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.





	 




	We have
	never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends
	on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon
	any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain
	the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.




	 





	We
	may be exposed to potential risks resulting from requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.





	 




	As a
	reporting company we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include in our annual report
	our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We do not have a sufficient number of employees
	to segregate responsibilities and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants or professionals
	to overcome our lack of employees.




	 




	We do
	not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result, our directors have the ability, among other things,
	to determine their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such
	compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against
	interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with
	funds necessary to expand our operations.











	 


	-12-





	Table of Contents









	 





	The
	costs to meet our reporting and other requirements as a public company subject to the Exchange Act of 1934 is and will be substantial
	and may result in us having insufficient funds to expand our business or even to meet routine business obligations.





	 




	As a
	public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we will continue to incur ongoing expenses associated
	with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. We estimate
	that these costs will range up to $35,000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity
	increases. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations.




	 





	State
	Securities Laws may limit secondary trading, which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell Shares.





	 




	Secondary
	trading in our common stock may not be possible in any state until the common stock is qualified for sale under the applicable
	securities laws of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals,
	is available for secondary trading in the state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the
	secondary trading of, the common stock in any particular state, the common stock cannot be offered or sold to, or purchased by,
	a resident of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock,
	the liquidity for the common stock could be significantly impacted.




	 






	Risks
	Relating to this Offering








	Investors cannot withdraw funds once invested and will
	not receive a refund.



	Investors do not have the right to withdraw invested funds.
	Subscription payments will be paid to Ihealthcare, Inc. and held in our corporate bank account if the Subscription Agreements
	are in good order and the Company accepts the investor’s investment. Therefore, once an investment is made, investors will
	not have the use or right to return of such funds.

	 





	The
	trading in our shares will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15G-9 which established the definition
	of a “Penny Stock.”





	The
	shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
	Act”), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice
	and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are,
	generally, institutions with assets in excess of $4,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income
	exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered
	by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual
	sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated
	persons, and must deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult
	for you to resell any shares you may purchase.


	 





	Due
	to the lack of a trading market for our securities, you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering.






	 





	We
	are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public
	market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the
	completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTCQB. The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that
	displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCQB is not a issuer
	listing services, market or exchange. Although the OTCQB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for
	quotation on the OTCQB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we
	are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the
	OTCQB. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement.
	Securities already quoted on the OTCQB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60
	day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be
	accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions
	or understandings between the Company and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a
	future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you
	to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit
	from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our
	common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult,
	if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your
	investment.




	 





	We
	will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance,
	making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all. 





	 




	The
	estimated cost of this registration statement is $25,000. We will have to utilize funds from our officers and directors, who have verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. We
	are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities
	Exchange Act. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares
	quoted on the OTCQB. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us
	to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a
	substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12
	month will be approximately $35,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be
	difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated

	Drug Screening Industry





	 







	The drug screening market-size is expected to grow from $4 billion
	in 2014 to $6.3 billion by 2019, at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 9.5%. Major factors driving the growth of this market
	include higher usage of alcohol, prescribed drugs, illicit drugs, and a growing aging population that leads to increased use of
	alcohol and prescription drugs. Funding by the U.S. Federal Governments for drug testing, enactment of stringent laws in developed
	countries, and growing awareness for drug testing in developing nations, has increased the awareness surrounding testing patients
	on a regular basis. In addition, emerging economies such as India, China, and Brazil present an array of opportunities for this
	market.


	 


	Currently, North America dominates the drug screening market, with
	the U.S. accounting for a major market share. However, the Asia-Pacific region is poised to grow at the highest CAGR during the
	forecast period. We believe there to be great growth potential in the Asian market due to development of advanced drug and alcohol
	screening devices in Japan, rising awareness regarding the importance of drug and alcohol screening, and increasing disposable
	income levels in various countries in Asia. 


	 


	The North American laboratory, as well as onsite testing market,
	has increased by more than 5.0% CAGR between 2011 and 2014. With past technologies it was necessary to retest a positive lab test,
	due to potential inaccuracies, which resulted in a higher cost. New technology enables employers to retest positive results inexpensively,
	and immediately, with the same, and new, samples from the subject, thus reducing the overall cost.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF BUSINESS 






	 










	Description of Business







	 




	We,
	Ihealthcare, Inc. are a Company that sells and distribute products in the healthcare sector. We currently hold a

	distribution
	agreement with Innovate Laboratory Solutions, also known as “ILS” to supply us a product known as the “UDT Cup”
	(also herein known as Multi-Panel [16] urinalysis cup or Drug of Abuse “DOA” Cup). ILS has agreed to provide us the
	right to purchase the UDT Cup at special pricing in certain quantities. ILS is the developer of the UDT Cup and exclusive global
	supplier of the UDT Cup, however they have the UDT Cup manufactured by a third party manufacturer of which they have not and will
	not disclose to us due to confidentiality. ILS does however, have the authority and right to control who manufactures the UDT
	Cup. 


	 


	We entered into and consummated the
	above agreement with ILS to sell us the UDT Cup at certain price points beginning on February 18, 2016. The term of the agreement
	is for a span of three years. We may buy the UDT Cup in varying quantities from ILS, provided they have enough inventory to fill
	our order, otherwise we will be limited to whatever they may have available at that time of order.


	 


	If both parties in writing agree to
	it they can terminate the above mentioned agreement. Our agreement with ILS also has a section titled “Termination for Cause.”
	This section states that:


	 


	“a. Either party will have the
	right to terminate the Agreement at any time if the other party is in breach of any material term, and which such party fails
	to cure within 10 calendar day after receiving written notice of the breach and the party’s intention to terminate. 


	 


	b. ILS shall have the right to terminate
	this Agreement if Distributor:


	 


	1. becomes insolvent;


	2. discontinues its business; or


	3. becomes the subject of any voluntary
	or involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, receivership, attachment or composition for the benefit of
	creditors. Such termination will become effective upon the non-terminating party’s receipt of a notice of termination
	at any time after the specified event.


	 


	Such termination will
	become effective upon the non-terminating party’s receipt of a notice of termination at any time after the specified event.”




	 


	Per our agreement with ILS there are no specific
	laws which we have expressly agreed to abide by. However, in general we have agreed to comply with all Federal and State healthcare
	laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, Stark, Anti-Kickback, False Claims Act, etc. Non-compliance of any
	rule, regulation or law, including the aforementioned, could in some way cause us to become the party of a civil or criminal suit.
	Generally speaking when one is a party in any civil or criminal suit it may negatively affect that party’s image and may
	also cause them financial harm. If this were to happen to us we may have to curtail operations, or allocate funds towards defending
	ourselves in any such case. If we were found guilty of violating any rule, regulation, or law our operations may be terminated,
	suspended, or harmed in some capacity.





	The
	UDT Cup’s intended purpose is for drug screening.




	 



	As of the date of this report, we have paid ILS $285.00 for
	the purchase of UDT Cups. This figure will increase as we purchase more UDT Cups in the future. ILS has paid us no monies to date.



	 











	Mission
	and Vision:





	 




	At
	Ihealthcare, Inc. we are dedicated to reducing costs and improving the quality of medical care through innovative products and
	services in specialized markets that are currently being underserved by our competition. Our primary focus is to establish sustainable

	Lateral
	Flow Process Expanded Definition






	 











	Lateral flow tests also known as lateral flow immunochromatographic assays,
	are simple devices intended to detect the presence (or absence) of a target analyte in sample (matrix) without the need for specialized
	and costly equipment  Typically, these tests are used for medical diagnostics either for home testing, point of care testing,
	or laboratory use. In this case, drugs of abuse testing.




	 




	The technology is based on a series of capillary beds, such as pieces of
	porous paper, microstructured polymer, or sintered polymer. Each of these elements has the capacity to transport
	fluid (e.g., urine) spontaneously. The first element (the sample pad) acts as a sponge and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once
	soaked, the fluid migrates to the second element (conjugate pad) in which the manufacturer has stored the so-called conjugate,
	a dried format of bio-active particles (see below) in a salt-sugar matrix that contains everything to guarantee an optimized chemical
	reaction between the target molecule (e.g., an antigen) and its chemical partner (e.g., antibody) that has been immobilized on
	the particle's surface.




	 




	While the sample fluid dissolves the salt-sugar matrix, it also dissolves
	the particles and in one combined transport action the sample and conjugate mix while flowing through the porous structure. In
	this way, the analyte binds to the particles while migrating further through the third capillary bed. This material has one or
	more areas (often called stripes) where a third molecule has been immobilized by the manufacturer. By the time the sample-conjugate
	mix reaches these strips, analyte has been bound on the particle and the third 'capture' molecule binds the complex. After a while,
	when more and more fluid has passed the stripes, particles accumulate and the stripe-area changes color. 




	 




	Typically there are at least two stripes: one (the control) that captures
	any particle and thereby shows that reaction conditions and technology worked fine, the second contains a specific capture molecule
	and only captures those particles onto which an analyte molecule has been immobilized. After passing these reaction zones the
	fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that simply acts as a waste container. Lateral flow then means the combination
	of these proprietary processes that scientifically allow/create the draw or flow of the sample laterally across these membranes
	for analysis.

	Additional Feature Definitions



	 


	FDA Cleared:

	Cleared medical
	devices: These medical devices are ones that the FDA has determined to be substantially equivalent to another legally
	marketed device. A pre-market notification, referred to as a 510(k), must be submitted to FDA for clearance.
	A 510(k) is most often submitted by the medical device manufacturer.



	 


	CLIA Waived:

	 

	Testing
	on human specimens for health assessment or the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are regulated under the Clinical
	Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA).

	As defined by CLIA, waived tests
	are simple tests with a low risk for an incorrect result. They include certain tests listed in the CLIA regulations,
	tests cleared by the FDA for home use, and tests approved for waiver by the FDA using the CLIA criteria.



	 


	The UDT Cup boasts 16 Drug Screening Panels which include: Amphetamines
	AMP; Barbiturates BAR; Buprenorphine BUP; Benzodiazepines BZO; Cocaine COC; Methamphetamines [2] mAMP & MDMA; Methadone MTD;
	Opiates OPI; Oxycodone OXY; Phencyclidine PCP; Marijuana THC; and Tricyclic Antidepressants TCA. Tests for Morphine MOR; Ketamine
	KET and Propoxyphene PPX or others can be added. Pregnancy tests also available.


	 



	Shipping



	 


	ILS is solely responsible for the shipment of all UDT Cups,
	with their primary shipping location based in Miami, Florida. Shipping is paid for solely by the consumer and if there are any
	problems or damage resulting from the shipment of UDT Cups then the liability for replacement products will fall on ILS. In the
	event that a product is damaged Ihealthcare, Inc. will notify ILS and return the shipment back to the Miami warehouse, whereupon
	it will be replaced and re-shipped to the consumer at no additional shipping cost to the customer.


	 


	The UDT cup that we currently sell may be purchased by any individual.


	 



	Uses and other information regarding the UDT Cup:



	 


	The UDT Cup is intended for detecting the presence of drugs
	in urine. Any situation it may be necessary to screen an individual for drug use would be an appropriate time to utilize the UDT
	Cup. Examples include but are not limited to screening potential employees, current employees, use in drug treatment centers or
	medical clinics.


	 


	Potential purchasers of the UDT Cup can be anyone however, most
	notably we anticipate it will be primarily medical clinics, hospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, Employers, Physician groups,
	transportation companies (used to test drivers for drug use) or wholesalers who will resell the product at a higher cost to make
	a profit. We have no intentions of limiting who can buy the UDT Cup.


	 


	The UDT Cup works by having the individual being tested.


	 


	The UDT cup is comprised of two elements, the test cup
	and dipcard.


	 


	Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Cup and Rapid Single/Multi-drug
	test Dipcard are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays designed to qualitatively detect the presence of drugs and drug metabolites
	in human urine and are classified under the following product code, classification, regulatory section and panel;

	The class to which
	your device is assigned determines the type of premarketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market. If your
	device is classified as Class I or II, and if it is not exempt, a 510k will be required for marketing. 


	A company that intends to market in the US a Class I,
	II, or III medical device intended for human use, for which a Premarket Approval (PMA) is not required, must submit a 510(k) to
	the FDA unless the device is exempt from the 510(k) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and does
	not exceed the limitations of exemptions for each of the device classification regulations (Section .9 of 21 CFR Parts 862 through
	892, e.g., 21 CFR 862.9, 21 CFR 864.9, etc.). Under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, a manufacturer must submit a 510(k) to
	FDA at least 90 days before introducing, or delivering for introduction, a device into interstate commerce for commercial distribution
	so the Agency can determine whether or not the device meets the criteria for market clearance (Sections 510(k) and (n) of the
	FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 360(k) & (n))). The Agency bases its decision on whether the device is substantially
	equivalent (SE) to a legally marketed (predicate) device (Section 513(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360c(i))). The
	device cannot be commercialized until FDA issues an order (510(k) clearance) stating that the device has been determined to be
	SE (Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360c(f)(1)))


	 


	Currently, we do not know the identity of the manufacturer
	of the UDT Cup. Our supplier, Innovative Laboratory Solutions is the only party we are aware of who knows the identity of the
	manufacturer of the cup. We rely in totality that the manufacturer, of which we do not know the identity of, is in compliance
	with the 510(k) requirements for the UDT cup.


	 


	ILS has informed us that the UDT cup is in compliance
	with the above and the 510(k) clearance date of the UDT Cup is December 19, 2014.



	 

	 



	A
	510(k) requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means
	that the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate. As mentioned previously the ILS Cup is a device classified
	as a Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Cup and Rapid Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard. 




	A
	device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:




	a. has the same intended use as the predicate; 

	and




	b. has the same technological characteristics as the
	predicate; 

	or




	c. has the same intended use as the predicate; 

	and




	d. has different technological characteristics and the
	information submitted to FDA;



	e. does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness; 

	and 




	f. demonstrates that the device is at least as safe
	and effective as the legally marketed device. 



	Medical device manufacturers involved in the distribution
	of devices must follow certain requirements and regulations once devices are on the market. These include such things as tracking
	systems, reporting of device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths, and registering the establishments where devices are produced
	or distributed. Postmarket requirements also include postmarket surveillance studies required under section 522 of the act as
	well as post-approval studies required at the time of approval of a premarket approval (PMA), humanitarian device exemption (HDE),
	or product development protocol (PDP) application. In accordance with Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act postmarket
	surveillance of a class II or class III device the UDT Cup may be required if the FDA. Should this occur the FDA will send a letter
	requiring it. For more information regarding such an FDA request please see here: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=822.5.


	The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 201 encompasses
	certain requirements that must be on the labeling of any medical product which includes, but is not limited to, the name and place
	of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, the directions for use, expiration date, and active ingredients in the
	product. We rely in totality on ILS, our supplier of the UDT Cup, to adhere to the appropriate product labeling so that the product
	is within the guidelines of Title 21, Part 201.


	Our supplier of the UDT Cup, ILS has made previous sales of
	the UDT Cup to customers in the past, primarily in Florida. The customers comprised of a combination of health centers, rehabilitation
	clinics, and private parties.


	 


	We are only a distributor (reseller) of the UDT Cup.
	As a distributor of the UDT Cup we are not required to have FDA approvals due to the CLIA waivers that are present for each panel
	of the UDT Cup.




	Our supplier Innovative Laboratory Solutions, however,
	has obtained the following in order to act as a global supplier, importer, and exporter of the UDT Cup (Drug Of Abuse Cup):


	SBD #155350

	FDA User Fee Organization # 394392

	Approved 04/03/2015 under the (MDUFA) Medical Device User Fee Act 





	Competition:




	 



	While we offer what we feel to be the most efficient and cost
	effective drug screening product on the market today, we do face intense competition from other Companies who offer similar products.


	 


	Competing one step products (meaning one device with multiple
	drug screening panels) include the following: DrugConfirm Advanced [10 panel]; AmeriCup [12 panel]; ECO II [10 panel]; CLIA Screen
	[12 panel]; T-Cup [10 panel]; EZ Split Key Cup [10 panel]; CentralCheck [11 panel]; NxStep [12 panel]; and others.


	 


	We believe the UDT Cup we offer to customers differs from most
	other drug screening products on the market and may serve as a better alternative to many such products due to the fact that it
	can provide test results in a lesser amount of time, one minute versus four to ten minutes for most competing products. Additionally,
	the UDT Cup has an internal seal that may prevent cross contamination of the urine sample when shaken or jostled during testing.
	This is a feature that most other competing drug screening kits do not have. The UDT Cup’s design is also designed in a
	way that can make it more suitable for use among both males and females. This however, is our own opinion. The UDT Cup also comes
	standard with a temperature strip included as part of the kit, something most other drug screening kits offer but only as an “add
	on feature” for an additional cost.

	We at Ihealthcare, Inc. intend to utilize web-based advertising
	in order to reach our intended market. We are currently in the exploration stages of determining which internet media outlet will
	be preferable, but we have plans to consider, and perhaps implement, marketing campaigns via social media networks such as Facebook,
	Twitter, etc., online marketing platforms, news related websites, industry related websites, etc. We will also be listing our
	products on Amazon in order to take advantage of the worldwide presence and reach of Amazon in order to reach an even greater
	audience and sell our products to as many consumers as possible.


	 


	In addition to our online presence, we also are in the planning
	stages of a multimedia campaign which may include, but may not strictly be limited to, telemarketing, print media, making our
	presence known at trade shows and television advertisements. The exact details of our multimedia plan are currently in the exploration
	and planning stages.


	 


	Our growth strategy is to spread awareness of our products,
	via the internet and potentially other sources, all cross the country, beginning in the south east, then moving north and eventually
	west. When, and if, we have developed a market for our products within the United States we will then evaluate the possibility
	of expanding to other countries throughout the world. 


	 


	At this time we do not have not yet identified a definitive
	timeline as to the length of time it will take us to initialize or carry out the above growth strategy. We are currently investigating
	the costs that we will incur in carrying out the above endeavors to begin generating sales from our current product.


	 


	We believe we need to develop a more concrete marketing plan
	so that we can sell the goods on a large scale (to more than one consumer from time to time). We also believe we need to hire
	additional staff of which we have begun to do so. To date we have hired what we refer to as an “SVP of Operations.”
	This individual is responsible for formulating our marketing plan moving forward, amending it as seen fit, contacting and facilitating
	relationships with potential wholesalers and overseeing any other sales employees we currently have or may hire in the future.
	Currently we have two sales team members that are commission based. At this point in time none of our sales have been a result
	of their efforts, and thus no commission has been paid at this time.









	 





	Properties:



	 


	Our office space is located at 3901 NW 28th Street, 2nd Floor,
	Miami, FL 33142 . This space is provided to the Company rent free by Noel Mijares, who leases the office space on his personal
	behalf. Besides the aforementioned we do not have any other facilities or properties at which we operate. We believe this space
	is suitable to carry out current and future operations.



	 





	Employees:



	 


	Currently, we have a total of three full time employees, two
	of which are our officers and directors, collectively Noel Mijares, and David A. Bingaman. The third is our recent hire for the
	position of “SVP of Operations.” As mentioned above on this page the SVP of Operations is responsible for formulating
	our marketing plan moving forward, amending it as seen fit, contacting and facilitating relationships with potential wholesalers
	and overseeing any other sales employees we currently have or may hire in the future. Currently we have two sales team members
	that are commission based employees that work part time at this moment. For the time being we are familiarizing these employees
	with the product and having them work alongside our SVP of Operations. Besides all of the above we have no other employees of
	any kind.


	 


	Our full time employees including our officers and directors,
	currently devote and intend to continue to devote 40 hours per week towards the Company. In the future we intend to increase our
	sales staff however, the number of employees we would hire would depend on our current level of revenue, and cash available to
	do so. We plan to hire these employees on a need be basis that is currently unidentified.

	DETERMINATION
	OF OFFERING PRICE





	 




	Since our
	shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily
	determined. The offering price was determined by us and is based on our own assessment of our financial condition and prospects,
	limited offering history, and the general condition of the securities market. It does not necessarily bear any relationship to
	our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. Although our common
	stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be seeking to obtain a listing on the OTCQB. In order to be quoted on the OTCQB,
	a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock.




	 




	There is
	no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the
	common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors,
	including the depth and liquidity of the market for the common stock, investor perception of us and general economic and market
	conditions.


	 










	 










	DILUTION





	 






	The price of the current
	offering is fixed at $0.25 per share.




	Dilution represents the
	difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering.
	Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets.
	Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution
	of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders.
	The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders.




	 




	The following
	table illustrates the dilution to the purchasers of the common stock in this offering (values are rounded to nearest hundredths
	place):

	PLAN
	OF DISTRIBUTION







	 




	The Company
	has 1,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. The Company is registering an additional
	of 250,000 shares of its common stock for sale at the price of $0.25 per share.




	 




	There is
	no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock.




	 




	In connection
	with the Company’s selling efforts in the offering, our Chief Executive Officer Noel Mijares will not register as a broker-dealer
	pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the “safe harbor” provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1,
	promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).




	 




	Generally
	speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated
	with an issuer that participate in an offering of the issuer’s securities. Noel Mijares is not subject to any statutory
	disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act. Noel Mijares will not be compensated in connection
	with his participation in the offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly
	on transactions in our securities. Noel Mijares is not, nor has he been within the past 12 months, a broker or dealer, and he
	is not, nor has he been within the past 12 months, an associated person of a broker or dealer. At the end of the offering, Noel
	Mijares will continue to primarily perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection with
	transactions in securities. Noel Mijares will not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once
	every 12 months other than in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii).




	 




	The Company
	will receive all proceeds from the sale of the 250,000 shares being offered on behalf of the company itself. The price per share
	is fixed at $0.25 for the duration of this offering. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted over-the
	counter, we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the Over-the Counter Bulletin Board. In order to be quoted
	on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock.
	There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance
	that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by the Company must be made at the fixed price of $0.25
	until a market develops for the stock. The Company’s shares may be sold to purchasers from time to time directly by and
	subject to the discretion of the Company. Further, the Company will not offer its shares for sale through underwriters, dealers,
	agents or anyone who may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from the Company
	and/or the purchasers of the shares for whom they may act as agents. The shares of common stock sold by the Company may be occasionally
	sold in one or more transactions; all shares sold under this prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of $0.25 per share.




	 






	In order
	to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those states only if
	they have been registered or qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available
	and with which the Company has complied.




	 




	In addition
	and without limiting the foregoing, the Company will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange
	Act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective.




	 




	Collectively,
	the Company’s officers and directors will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares (including registration
	pursuant to the securities laws of certain states), which we expect to be no more than $25,000.




	 





	Procedures
	for Subscribing





	If you
	decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must




	 




	-
	Execute and deliver a subscription agreement; and




	-
	Deliver a check or certified funds to us for acceptance or rejection.




	 




	All checks
	for subscriptions must be made payable to “Ihealthcare, Inc”. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable
	to shares of common stock purchased directly to the purchasers within ninety (90) days of the close of the offering.




	 





	Right
	to Reject Subscriptions





	We have
	the right to accept or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions
	will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted
	or rejected with letter by mail within 48 hours after we receive them.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF SECURITIES







	 




	The total
	number of authorized shares of stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 150,000,000, consisting of 143,500,000 shares
	of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 6,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share. The first
	Series of Preferred Stock is designated “Series A Preferred Stock” and consists of 1,500,000 shares. The second Series
	of Preferred Stock is designated “Series B Preferred Stock” and consists of 5,000,000 shares.





	 





	As
	of the date of this filing we have 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock and no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.



	 






	 





	There is no established
	public trading market for our stock. 




	 





	Common
	Stock





	The
	holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets or funds legally available for the
	payment of dividends of such times and in such amounts as the board from time to time may determine. Holders of Common Stock are
	entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. There is no cumulative voting of
	the election of directors then standing for election. The Common Stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject
	to conversion or redemption. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the assets legally available for distribution
	to stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of the Common Stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any,
	on any outstanding payment of other claims of creditors.




	 




	The
	holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and
	written actions in lieu of meetings); provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as
	such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one
	or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together
	with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or pursuant to
	the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
	then outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required by
	the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
	representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
	irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.


	 





	 






	Preferred
	Stock





	Shares
	of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each of which shall have such distinctive designation
	or title as shall be determined by our Board of Directors (“Board of Directors”) prior to the issuance of any shares
	thereof. Preferred Stock shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such preferences and relative,
	participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated
	in such resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such class or series of Preferred Stock as may be adopted from time
	to time by the Board of Directors prior to the issuance of any shares thereof. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock
	may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders
	of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election
	of the directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series
	thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.




	 




	The
	holders of shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as
	a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders
	of the corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation
	and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly
	provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Common Stock and Preferred B Stock shall have the right to one (1)
	vote per share of held of record by such holder and each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to one hundred
	(100) votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock held of record by such holder.





	 








	Additional Information 



	 


	Article IX of
	our Certificate of Incorporation states that “unless we, the “Company” also referred to herein as “the
	Corporation” consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
	shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought
	on behalf of the corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by,
	any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation’s stockholders, (3) any
	action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law or the corporation’s Restated
	Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the corporation’s
	Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (5) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
	in each such case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants
	therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall
	be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX. Due to this provision, if a shareholder does not
	reside in Delaware then they may face difficulty bringing any action against us in a judicial forum due to the fact that all such
	claims must be made in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. This may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims
	against the company and its officers, directors or other employees.

	Dividend
	Policy





	We have
	not paid any cash dividends to shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of
	directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, general economic conditions,
	and other pertinent conditions.  It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but
	rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations.

	At this

	Penny
	Stock Regulation

	 




	The SEC
	has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as
	defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share. Such securities are subject to rules
	that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell them. For transactions covered by these rules, the
	broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser’s
	written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt,
	the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock
	market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative,
	current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this
	fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market. Finally, among other requirements, monthly statements must
	be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny
	stocks. As the Shares immediately following this Offering will likely be subject to such penny stock rules, purchasers in this
	Offering will in all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their Shares in the secondary market.

	Experience:




	 


	2010
	- 2014: President: Aspen Ventures, Venture Firm


	2014
	- 2015: Chief Operating Officer: East Coast Ambulance LLC., Healthcare Industry

	Corporate
	Governance





	 




	The Company
	promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
	disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
	and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and
	regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company’s
	employees, officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.




	 




	In lieu
	of an Audit Committee, the Company’s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
	the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial
	statements and other services provided by the Company’s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief
	Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices
	and policies.




	 




	Committees
	of the Board




	 




	Our
	Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does
	our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our officers and directors believe that it is
	not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the Directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees.





	 





	Audit Committee
	Financial Expert




	 




	Our Board
	of Directors have determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert”
	as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as “independent” as the
	term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule
	4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules.




	 




	We
	believe that our Directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls
	and procedures for financial reporting. The Directors of our Company do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee
	because management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition,
	we believe that retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an "

	audit committee financial expert

	"
	would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact
	that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date.

	Involvement
	in Certain Legal Proceedings




	 




	Our
	officers and directors have not been involved in or a party in any of the following events or actions during the past ten years:




	 






	1.




	any
	bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either
	at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;






	2.




	any conviction
	in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);






	3.




	being subject
	to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
	permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities
	or banking activities; or






	4.




	being found
	by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
	violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.












	5.




	Such person was
	found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities
	law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or
	vacated;






	6.




	Such person was
	found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
	any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
	has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated;






	7.




	Such person was
	the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently
	reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law
	or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
	to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent
	cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud
	in connection with any business entity; or






	8.




	Such person was
	the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
	organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined
	in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or
	organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.






	 





	Independence
	of Directors





	 




	We
	are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until
	such time as we are required to do so.




	 





	Code
	of Ethics





	 




	We
	have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees
	and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and
	state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or
	Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.




	 





	Shareholder
	Proposals





	 




	Our
	Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations
	for Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be
	premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently
	have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process
	or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management
	or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.




	 




	A
	shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our our
	Chief Executive Officer Noel Mijares, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

	*On
	January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the sole shareholder of the Company transferred to Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company,
	20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of transfer. The
	transfer was the result of the sale of the Company to Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.




	 




	On
	January 14, 2016 Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the
	time of the sale of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned 37.5% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.




	 






	Pursuant to the
	Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Agreement”) dated April 22, 2016, by and between, Ihealthcare, Inc. a Florida Corporation
	(“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida”), and Opulent Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware”
	or the “Surviving Corporation), jointly the (“Constituent Corporations”) effective as of April 22, 2016, Ihealthcare,
	Inc.-Florida merged with and into Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware with Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware continuing as the Surviving Corporation.




	 




	The board of directors
	of the Constituent Corporations have declared the Merger Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Constituent
	Corporations and have approved the Merger.




	 






	Immediately before
	the effective time of the Merger each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Ihealthcare-Delaware held by Ihealthcare-Florida
	was cancelled. Each share issued and outstanding of Ihelathcare-Florida held by the shareholders was converted into one hundred
	validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Ihealthcare-Delaware.




	 




	Previous to the
	Merger Noel Mijares owned 6,250 shares of common stock of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company and David A Bingaman owned 3,750
	shares of common stock of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. After the merger each one of these shares were converted into
	100 shares of our common stock (Ihealthcare, Inc., a Delaware Company, formerly known as Opulent Acquistion, Inc).




	 




	Currently, Noel
	Mijares owns 625,000 shares of our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our common stock.

	Compensation





	 




	The Board

	for their services to the Company, which awards, if granted shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors.




	 





	Executive
	Compensation Philosophy






	 





	Our Board
	of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves
	the right to pay our executive or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration
	for services rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive
	officer’s performance. This package may also include long-term stock based compensation to certain executives, which is
	intended to align the performance of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors
	has not granted any performance base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in
	the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company.




	 





	Incentive
	Bonus





	 




	The Board
	of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if
	the Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company’s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives
	and growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions

	Beneficial
	ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d


	-3 under
	the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example,
	persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned
	by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days
	of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares
	is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result,
	the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the person’s
	actual voting power at any particular date.





	 










	CERTAIN
	RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS







	 


	On
	January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the sole shareholder of the Company transferred to Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company,
	20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of transfer, in consideration
	of $34,900. The transfer was the result of the sale of the Company to Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.




	 


	On
	January 14, 2016 Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the
	time of the sale of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned 37.5% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.


	 


	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer
	and Director.


	 


	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. Noel Mijares was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and President.


	 


	On
	January 14, 2016, Mr. David A. Bingaman was appointed as Chief Operating Officer, Vice President, and Secretary.


	 




	Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
	(“Agreement”) dated April 22, 2016, by and between, Ihealthcare, Inc. a Florida Corporation (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida”),
	and Opulent Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware” or the “Surviving Corporation),
	jointly the (“Constituent Corporations”) effective as of April 22, 2016, Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida merged with and
	into Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware with Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware continuing as the Surviving Corporation.


	 


	The board of directors of the Constituent
	Corporations have declared the Merger Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Constituent Corporations and
	have approved the Merger.


	 




	Immediately before the effective time of the
	Merger each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Ihealthcare-Delaware held by Ihealthcare-Florida was cancelled.
	Each share issued and outstanding of Ihelathcare-Florida held by the shareholders was converted into one hundred validly issued,
	fully paid, and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Ihealthcare-Delaware.




	 


	On
	April 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation,
	changing its name to Ihealthcare, Inc.



	 




	On
	May 13, 2016 David A. Bingaman was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Director.





	 













	Review,
	Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions





	 




	Given
	our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or
	ratification of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer(s), Director(s) and significant stockholders.
	We intend to establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional
	Directors, so that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an
	appropriate committee thereof. On a moving forward basis, our Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 




	To the Board of Directors
	and Stockholder of




	Opulent Acquisition, Inc.




	Miami, Florida




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of iHealhcare, Inc. (formerly known as Opulent Acquisition, Inc.) (the "Company")
	as of November 30, 2015 and 2014 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockhol


	ders’
	deficit and cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2015 and for the period from November 25, 2014 (inception) November 30,
	2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
	on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We conducted
	our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In our
	opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company,
	as of November 30, 2015 and 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2015 and
	for the period from November 25, 2015 (inception) through November 30, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to
	the financial statements, the Company has suffered a net loss, working capital deficiency, does not have assets, nor does it have
	operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
	as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	November
	30, 2015, and November 30, 2014












	 





	 







	Note
	1 – Organization and Description of Business





	 




	Opulent
	Acquisition, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014. The Company intends
	to serve as a vehicle to affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic
	or foreign business. As of November 30, 2015 the Company had not yet commenced any operations.




	 




	The Company
	has elected November 30th as its year end.




	 





	Note
	2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation






	 





	The Financial
	Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(“SEC”). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally
	Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) of the United States (See Note 3) regarding the assumption that the Company
	is a “going concern”.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The preparation
	of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
	the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion
	of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Due to the
	minimal level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that
	the Company is a going concern. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Cash
	Equivalents





	 




	The Company
	considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
	Cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2015 and 2014 were $0.




	  





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The Company
	accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, “

	Income Taxes

	.”  Under the asset and liability method of ASC
	740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
	financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
	differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
	rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred
	tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred
	tax assets or liabilities were recognized at November 30, 2015 or November 30, 2014.




	 







	Basic
	Earnings (Loss) Per Share






	 





	The Company computes basic
	and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, 

	Earnings per Share

	. Basic earnings per share
	is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and
	other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could
	share in the earnings of the Company. As of November 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no common stock equivalents or options outstanding.




	 





	Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments





	The Company’s balance
	sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their
	fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.




	 




	ASC 820, 

	Fair Value
	Measurements and Disclosures

	, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
	a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
	(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and
	(2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available
	in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority
	to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:




	 






	·          




	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in
	active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.






	·          




	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices
	included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices
	for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
	that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates);
	and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.






	·          




	Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant
	to the fair value measurement and unobservable.






	 




	Fair value estimates discussed
	herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of November 30, 2015 and
	2014. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the
	short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include accrued expenses.





	 






	Share-based Expense





	 




	ASC 718, “

	Compensation
	– Stock Compensation

	”, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions
	in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options,
	and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees,
	including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their
	fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for
	the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).




	 




	The Company accounts for stock-based
	compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “

	Equity –
	Based Payments to Non-Employees.”

	  Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based
	on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:  (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
	issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date
	or performance completion date.  




	 




	The company had no
	stock-based compensation plans at November 30, 2015 and 2014.




	Share-based expense for the
	twelve months ended November 30, 2015 was $0.




	 




	Share-based expense for the
	period from November 25, 2014 through November 30, 2014 was $2,000.

	Related

	The Company follows
	ASC 850,

	 Related Party Disclosures, 

	for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party
	transactions.





	Recent Accounting
	Pronouncements





	In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting
	Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, 

	Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern; Disclosures of Uncertainties
	about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.

	The amendments in this update provide guidance in GAAP about
	management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as
	a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing
	and content of footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
	periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted but not required; at this time we are not early adopting.
	As the objective of this accounting standard is to provide guidance on the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s
	ability to continue as a going concern, the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results
	of operations.




	 




	In June 2014,
	the FASB issued ASU 2014-10,

	Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements,
	Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.

	The amendments in this update remove
	all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities and also eliminate an exception
	provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity
	on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein, with early application permitted. Early application of each of the amendments
	is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet
	been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). We early adopted this pronouncement. As
	the objective of the amendments in this update is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated
	with the incremental reporting requirements for development stage entities our early adoption of this guidance has not impacted
	our financial position or results of operations.




	 





	Note 3 – Going
	Concern





	The Company’s financial
	statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
	that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	The Company demonstrates adverse
	conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the
	issuance of these financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working
	capital deficiency, negative cash flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios.




	 




	The Company has not established
	any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions
	to capital. There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful.




	 




	The financial statements do
	not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
	of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

	Note 4 – Accrued Expenses





	Accrued expenses totaled
	$3,446 and $2,148 at November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014, respectively for general and administrative expenses.




	 





	Note 5 –
	Commitments and Contingencies






	 





	The Company follows ASC 450-20, 

	Los

	s

	 Contingencies, 

	to
	report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines
	and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment
	can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of November 30, 2015 and 2014.




	 





	Note 6 - Income Taxes






	 





	The Company has not recognized an
	income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income
	in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax
	assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future
	periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
	to be more likely than not. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards
	for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating
	loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years




	 




	As of November 30, 2015, the Company
	has incurred a net loss carryforward of approximately $11,644 which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes.
	NOLs begin expiring in 2034. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $4,775 at the effective statutory rate
	of 35%. The deferred tax asset has been off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS





	August
	31, 2016





	 






	Note
	1 - Organization and Description of Business






	 




	iHealthcare Inc. (formerly Opulent Acquisition,
	Inc.) (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014. The Company intended to serve
	as a vehicle to affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or
	foreign business. The Company originally elected November 30th as its year end but has applied to change its fiscal year end to
	December 31. As of now however, the fiscal year is November 30th.


	 


	On January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio,
	the sole shareholder of the Company transferred to iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock
	which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of transfer, in consideration of $25,000. The transfer was
	the result of the sale of the Company to iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. The result of the January 14, 2016 transaction
	was iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) became the wholly owned subsidiary of iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). Due to management’s
	intent to merge iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) and iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida) at a later date $34,980 paid by iHealthcare,
	Inc. (Florida) was accounted for in Paid in Capital of iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). This was based on a conclusion that iHealthcare,
	Inc. (formerly Opulent) would not qualify as a business under ASC 805 due to iHealthcare, Inc.’s (formerly Opulent) lack
	of assets, operations, inputs or processes at the acquisition date. The use of Fair Value and purchase accounting did not appear
	appropriate considering the aforementioned facts and management’s intent to merge the entities. Management took a view at
	the acquisition date towards 805-50 and the eventual use of the rules covering a merger of entities under common control.


	 


	On January 14, 2016 iHealthcare, Inc.,
	a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the time of the sale of Opulent Acquisition,
	Inc. Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned 37.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida
	Company.


	 


	On January 14, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio
	resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of Opulent Acquisition,
	Inc.


	 


	On January 14, 2016, Mr. Noel Mijares
	was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and President.


	 


	On January 14, 2016, Mr. David A. Bingaman
	was appointed as Chief Operating Officer, Vice President, and Secretary.


	 


	On April 22, 2016 we, Opulent Acquisition,
	Inc. (“iHealthcare, Inc.-Delaware”) entered into and consummated a merger with iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company
	(“iHealthcare, Inc.-Florida”). iHealthcare, Inc.-Delaware is the Surviving Corporation as result of the merger. The
	officers and directors of Opulent Acquisition, Inc., now known as iHealthcare, Inc., remained the same and unchanged.


	 


	On April 22, 2016, iHealthcare, Inc.
	(formerly Opulent) and iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida) were under common control. iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) was 100% owned
	by iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). Due to the parent subsidiary relationship on April 22, 2016, under ASC 805-50, the transaction
	is being accounted for similar to a pooling of interests with carryover basis being used and go forward reporting will have the
	entities combined from the first day of the first period presented.


	 


	On April 22, 2016, the Company filed
	with the Delaware Secretary of State an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, changing its name to iHealthcare,
	Inc.


	 


	Previous to the Merger Noel Mijares
	owned 6,250 shares of common stock of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company and David A Bingaman owned 3,750 shares of common
	stock of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. After the merger each one of these shares were converted into 100 shares of our
	common stock (iHealthcare, Inc., a Delaware Company, formerly known as Opulent Acquisition, Inc). The 20,000,000 shares of common
	stock owned by iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company of iHealthcare, Inc., formerly known as Opulent Acquisition Inc., a Delaware
	Company were cancelled upon consummation of the merger. All share amounts are adjusted retroactively.


	 


	Currently, Noel Mijares owns 625,000
	shares of our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our common stock.


	 


	The total number of authorized shares
	of stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 150,000,000, consisting of 143,500,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par
	value per share, and 6,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share.


	 


	On May 13, 2016 David A. Bingaman was appointed
	as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Director.


	 


	On July 25, 2016 we, Ihealthcare, Inc.,
	organized Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company.


	 


	On August 2, 2016 we, Ihealthcare, Inc.
	transferred 50% of the membership interests in Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC to All in 1 Medical, LLC per the terms of the Joint Venture
	agreement stated below.


	 


	Each of the aforementioned parties own
	50% of the membership interests in Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC. All in 1 Medical, LLC is owned and operated by Mark Heffner, who
	is a non-affiliate of Ihealthcare, Inc.


	 


	As of August 31, 2016 Ihealthcare Surgical,
	LLC has not had any monetary transactions.


	 


	On August 19, 2016 Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, entered into
	and consummated a joint venture agreement with All In 1 Medical, LLC. The purpose of the joint venture agreement is to forge a
	relationship that through, to be determined means, will bring together both parties in an effort to sell, to be determined, medical
	products. Each party retains a 50% interest in the joint venture. Each party has also agreed to split profits and expenses equally
	that relate to the joint venture. The term of the joint venture agreement is through August 4, 2026. It may be renewed however,
	for an additional five year term if agreed upon by both parties. Each party of the joint venture agreement has agreed to contribute
	$500 for business purposes set forth in the joint venture agreement. Neither party has, as of the date of this report, contributed
	the $500 however, both parties intend to make such contribution after a joint bank account is opened up for the purpose of the
	joint venture.


	 


	Per the above the Company has applied ASC 323 for presentation
	and disclosure requirements. Because Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC conducted no monetary business as of August 31, 2016 there were
	no transactions recorded on the books for this period.




	 




	Note
	2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies






	 





	Principals of Consolidation




	 



	These financial statements include the accounts of the Company’s
	wholly owned subsidiary iHealthcare, all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 


	 



	Basis of Presentation




	 



	The accompanying unaudited consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
	for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements
	do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
	statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such
	adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
	the financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2015 and notes thereto.


	 


	The results of operations for the nine
	month period ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. 


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories, consisting of products available
	for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market
	value. This valuation requires Ihealthcare, Inc. to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely
	method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected
	recoverable values of each disposition category.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when it
	is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
	criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been
	rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

	Table of Contents











	Note 3
	- Going Concern








	The Company’s unaudited consolidated
	financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to
	a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


	 


	The Company demonstrates adverse conditions
	that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of
	these financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital
	deficiency, negative cash flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios.


	 


	The Company has not established any
	source of revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to
	capital. There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful.


	 


	The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
	be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.


	 




	Note 4 -
	Related-Party Transactions








	 






	Due to related party






	 





	Pharma Tropical, which is
	controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, loaned the Company $500 during the year for payment of Company expenses which
	was considered forgiven and converted to contributed capital as an addition to APIC.





	 






	Unisource Discovery, Inc., is a related party and is controlled
	by our Chief Executive Officer, Noel Mijares. During the period Unisource Discovery Inc. advanced the Company $6,015 and the Company
	made payment of $3,805 on these advances which are noninterest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand. The total due to the Unisource
	Discovery Inc. as of August 31, 2016 is $2,210.


	  


	During the nine month period ending August 31,
	2016, the Company borrowed $15,775 from the Chief Executive Officer to pay for expenses on behalf of the company in the
	current year. $7,500 of the money borrowed, in addition to previous payments, were posted as a reduction to the subscription
	receivable owed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company


	 


	As of August 31, 2016, the Company was indebted to the
	Chief Executive Officer of the Company in the amount of $8,275 which is noninterest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.


	 




	Additional paid in capital




	 


	As a result of the merger a subscription receivable was contributed by the principal shareholders in the amount
	$34,800. The Company has collected $21,980 from the subscription receivable and reduced the subscription receivable by $7,500 against
	the loan owed by the Company to the CEO. As of August 31, 2016 the subscription receivable balance is $5,500 due by the CFO to
	the Company.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders’ of


	iHealthcare, Inc.


	Miami, Florida


	 


	We have audited the accompanying
	balance sheet of iHealthcare, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations,
	changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the period from September 8, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audit.


	We conducted our audit in accordance
	with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit includes
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
	reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
	and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
	made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company, as of December 31, 2015 and
	the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from September 8, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015 in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements,
	the Company has suffered a net loss and does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation which raises substantial
	doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 3.
	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Notes

	Note 1 - Organization and Description
	of Business



	 


	Ihealthcare, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the
	laws of the State of Florida on September 8, 2015. Ihealthcare, Inc. is a health-focused company currently engaged in launching
	its first product - a urinalysis testing cup, for which it has a global distribution agreement. The Company is also focusing on
	its core business plan which is to acquire health-related software platforms and/or networks.


	 


	The Company has elected December 31st
	as its year end.


	 



	Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying
	audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
	of America.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary
	in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Due to the minimal level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption
	that the Company is a going concern.


	 



	Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
	at December 31, 2015 were $100.


	 


	-F23- 






	Table of Contents



	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes
	under ASC 740, “

	Income Taxes

	.”  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
	liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying
	amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
	recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
	in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely
	than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were
	recognized at December 31, 2015.


	 



	Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share




	 



	The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share
	amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings per Share

	. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
	(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.
	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common
	stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.


	 


	The Company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments
	as of December 31, 2015 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial
	instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively
	short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.


	ASC 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	,
	defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
	the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
	measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions
	developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions
	about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
	The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels
	of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


	 





	·


	        


	 




	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.






	·


	        


	 




	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.






	·


	        


	 




	Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.





	 


	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
	certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value
	of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
	These financial instruments include accrued expenses.



	Related Parties



	The Company follows ASC 850,

	Related Party Disclosures,

	for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.



	Share-based Expense



	 


	ASC 718, “

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	”,
	prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired.
	Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such
	as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
	stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized
	over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service
	period (usually the vesting period).


	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued
	to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “

	Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees.”

	 Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably
	measurable:  (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair value of the share-based
	payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.  


	 


	The company had no stock-based compensation plans December
	31, 2015.


	Share-based expense for the period ended December 31, 2015
	was $0.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
	No. 2014-15,

	Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern; Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.

	The amendments in this update provide guidance in GAAP about management’s responsibility
	to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
	footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The
	guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
	Early adoption is permitted but not required; at this time we are not early adopting. As the objective of this accounting standard
	is to provide guidance on the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the adoption
	of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations.


	 


	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10,
	Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable
	Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting
	requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities and also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities
	in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment
	equity that is at risk. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim
	periods therein, with early application permitted. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting
	period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities)
	or made available for issuance (other entities). We early adopted this pronouncement. As the objective of the amendments in this
	update is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements
	for development stage entities our early adoption of this guidance has not impacted our financial position or results of operations.


	 



	Note 3 - Going Concern



	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization
	of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


	 


	The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these financial statements.
	These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, and no established sources of revenues.


	 


	The Company has not established any source of revenue to
	cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is no
	assurance that management's plan will be successful.

	Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies




	 



	The Company follows ASC 450-20,

	Los

	s

	Contingencies,

	to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation,
	fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
	assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of December 31, 2015 with the exception of
	that with ETN Services, LLC.


	 


	On October 19, 2015 the Company entered into and consummated
	an agreement with ETN Services, LLC for ETN Services, LLC to provide consulting services to the Company. As detailed in the agreement
	with ETN Services, LLC, the Company is to pay ETN Services, LLC $5,000 upon filing of a S-1 Registration Statement on behalf of
	Ihealthcare, Inc. (post merger). Additionally, after the Registration Statement is deemed to be effective by the SEC, the Company
	is to pay ETN Services, LLC an additional $5,000. Finally, after a market maker files form 15c2-11 on the Company’s behalf
	and a ticker symbol has been attained, the Company is to pay ETN Services and additional $5,000. All payments to ETN Services are
	to be made within 7 days of the Company’s receipt of an invoice detailing the payment terms and amount.


	 	



	Note 5 - Income Taxes



	The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit
	for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
	The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from
	the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits
	and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than
	not.


	Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform
	Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should
	a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015, the Company has incurred a net
	loss of approximately $3,000 which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. NOLs begin expiring in 2035. The loss
	results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $1,050 at the effective statutory rate of 35%. The deferred tax asset has been
	off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

	The
	following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to the Merger between Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company,

	the (“Constituent Corporations”) effective as of April 22, 2016, Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida merged with and into Ihealthcare,

	consummation of the merger.

	our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our common stock.

	NOTES AND
	ASSUMPTIONS TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(Unaudited)




	 



	On
	January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the sole shareholder of the Company transferred to Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company,
	20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of transfer, in consideration
	of $34,900. The transfer was the result of the sale of the Company to Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.


	 



	The
	result of the January 14, 2016 transaction was Ihealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) became the wholly owned subsidiary of Ihealthcare,
	Inc. (Florida).  Due to management’s intent to merge Ihealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) and Ihealthcare, Inc. (Florida)
	at a later date the $25,000 paid by Ihealthcare, Inc. (Florida) was accounted for in Paid in Capital of Ihealthcare, Inc. (Florida).
	This was based on a conclusion that Ihealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) would not qualify as a business under ASC 805 due to Ihealthcare,
	Inc.’s (formerly Opulent) lack of assets, operations, inputs or processes at the acquisition date. The use of Fair Value
	and purchase accounting did not appear appropriate considering the aforementioned facts and management’s intent to merge
	the entities. Management took a view at the acquisition date towards 805-50 and the eventual use of the rules covering a merger
	of entities under common control.

	 


	 


	On
	January 14, 2016 Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the time
	of the sale of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned 37.5% of the issued and outstanding shares
	of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company.


	 


	On
	February 18, 2016 we, Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, entered into a distribution agreement with Innovative Laboratory Solutions
	“ILS” granting us the rights to sell and distribute the product of which they are a supplier for, known as the “UDT
	Cup” Multi-Panel [16] urinalysis cup. No consideration has been paid by us to ILS in order to enter into this agreement with
	them. The agreement is now attached as exhibit 10.2, attached herein.


	 


	On April 22, 2016 we, Opulent Acquisition, Inc. (“Ihealthcare,
	Inc.-Delaware”) entered into and consummated a merger with Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company (“Ihealthcare, Inc.-Florida”).
	Ihealthcare, Inc.-Delaware is the Surviving Corporation as result of the merger. The officers and directors of Opulent Acquisition,
	Inc., now known as Ihealthcare, Inc., remained the same and unchanged. Our officers and directors con

	tinue
	to serve their respective positions with the Company.



	 


	On April 22, 2016, IHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) and IHealthcare,
	Inc. (Florida) were under common control. IHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) was 100% owned by IHealthcare, Inc. (Florida).
	Due to the parent subsidiary relationship on April 22, 2016, under ASC 805-50, the transaction is being accounted for similar
	to a pooling of interests with carryover basis being used and go forward reporting will have the entities combined from the first
	day of the first period presented. 


	 



	On
	April 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Delaware Secreta

	ry of State an amendment to the Company’s certificate of
	incorporation, changing its name to Ihealthcare, Inc.


	 



	(A)

	Previous to the Merger Noel Mijares
	owned 6,250 shares of common stock of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company and David A Bingaman owned 3,750 shares of common
	stock of Ihealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. After the merger each one of these shares were converted into 100 shares of our
	common stock (Ihealthcare, Inc., a Delaware Company, formerly known as Opulent Acquistion, Inc). The 20,000,000 shares of common
	stock owned by Ihealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company of Ihealthcare, Inc., formerly known as Opulent Acquistion Inc., a Delaware
	Company were cancelled upon consummation of the merger.


	 


	Currently, Noel Mijares owns 625,000 shares of
	our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our common stock.


	 


	The total number of authorized shares of
	stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 150,000,000, consisting of 143,500,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value
	per share, and 6,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share. The first Series of Preferred Stock is designated
	“Series A Preferred Stock” and consists of 1,500,000 shares. The second Series of Preferred Stock is designated “Series
	B Preferred Stock” and consists of 5,000,000 shares.


	 





	 




	Per our restated Articles of Incorporation: 



	 




	Common Stock





	The
	holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets or funds legally available for the
	payment of dividends of such times and in such amounts as the board from time to time may determine. Holders of Common Stock are
	entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. There is no cumulative voting of the
	election of directors then standing for election. The Common Stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject to
	conversion or redemption. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the assets legally available for distribution
	to stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of the Common Stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any,
	on any outstanding payment of other claims of creditors.



	 



	The
	holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written
	actions in lieu of meetings); provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall
	not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding
	series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of
	one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or pursuant to the DGCL. The number
	of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding)
	by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required by the terms of the Certificate
	of Incorporation) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of
	the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions
	of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

	 



	 





	Preferred Stock





	Shares
	of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each of which shall have such distinctive designation
	or title as shall be determined by our Board of Directors (“Board of Directors”) prior to the issuance of any shares
	thereof. Preferred Stock shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such preferences and relative,
	participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated
	in such resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such class or series of Preferred Stock as may be adopted from time
	to time by the Board of Directors prior to the issuance of any shares thereof. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock
	may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders
	of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election
	of the directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series
	thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.



	 



	The
	holders of shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a
	single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders of
	the corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation
	and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly
	provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Common Stock and Preferred B Stock shall have the right to one (1)
	vote per share of held of record by such holder and each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to one hundred
	(100) votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock held of record by such holder.

	if indemnification shall be a contract right which may be enforced

	in

	any manner
	desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such directors, officers,
	or representatives may have hereafter acquire and, without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to
	their respective

	rights

	of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders,
	provisions of law or otherwise, as well as their right under this Article.

	UNDERTAKINGS





	The undersigned
	Registrant hereby undertakes:




	 




	(a)(1) To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration
	statement to:




	 




	(i) Include
	any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	 




	(ii) To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
	post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
	forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if
	the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high
	end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
	383(b) (§230.383(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change
	in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective
	registration statement.




	 




	(iii) To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
	or any material change to such information in the registration statement;




	 




	(2) That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed
	to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time
	shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	 




	(3) To remove
	from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination
	of the offering.




	 




	(4) That,
	for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:




	 




	(i) If the
	registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 383(b) as part of a registration statement relating
	to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A,
	shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.
	Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement
	or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part
	of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify
	any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in
	any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.




	 




	(5) That,
	for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution
	of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant
	pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if
	the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant
	will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	 




	(i) Any
	preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule
	383;




	 




	(ii) Any
	free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to
	by the undersigned registrant;




	 




	(iii) The
	portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant
	or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	 




	(iv) Any
	other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors,
	officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the
	SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.




	 




	In the event
	that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of
	our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one
	of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the
	opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
	question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by
	the final adjudication of such issue.

	Re:


	Form S-1, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for Ihealthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
	filed May 6, 2016




	CIK:	0001634291


	 


	Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 


	This opinion is submitted
	pursuant to Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the registration of 250,000 shares
	of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Shares”), for public sale by the Issuer.


	 


	In connection therewith,
	I have examined and relied upon original, certified, conformed, Photostat or other copies of the following documents:


	 


	i. The Restated Articles
	of Incorporation of the Company, filed April 22, 2016;


	ii. Bylaws of the Company,
	dated April 22, 2016;


	iii. The Registration Statement
	noted above and the Exhibits thereto; and


	iv. Such other documents
	and matters of law as I have deemed necessary for the expression of the opinion herein contained.


	 


	In all such examinations,
	I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original documents, and the conformity to the originals of all copies submitted
	to me by the parties herein. In passing upon certain corporate records and documents of the Company, I have necessarily assumed
	the correctness and completeness of the statements made or included therein by the Company, and I express no opinion thereon. As
	to the various questions of fact material to this opinion, I have relied, to the extent I deemed reasonably appropriate, upon representations
	or certificates of officers or directors of the Company and upon documents, records and instruments furnished to me by the Company,
	without verification except where such verification was readily ascertainable.


	 


	Based on the foregoing,
	I am of the opinion that the Shares, when issued according to the terms of the prospectus contained in this registration statement,
	will be duly and validly issued, duly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable.


	 


	This opinion is limited
	to the laws of the State of Delaware and federal law as in effect on the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement,
	exclusive of state securities and blue-sky laws, rules and regulations, and to all facts as they presently exist.


	 


	I hereby consent to the
	filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of my name under the caption "Interests
	of Named Experts and Counsel" in the prospectus comprising part of the Registration Statement.


	 


	 


	Sincerely,
