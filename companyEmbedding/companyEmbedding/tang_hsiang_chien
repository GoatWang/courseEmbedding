Tang Hsiang Chien - Wikipedia





















 






Tang Hsiang Chien

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Tang.





Tang Hsiang Chien


Chinese
唐翔千





Transcriptions


Standard Mandarin


Hanyu Pinyin
Táng Xiángqiān








Leo Tang Hsiang Chien, GBS, OBE, JP (born June 8, 1923, Shanghai) was a member of the Standing Committee of the 7–9th CPPCC National Committee.
Tang graduated from Utopia University in Shanghai in 1945 and received a master's degree from Illinois State University in 1948. He moved to Hong Kong in 1950.[1] He is the father of Henry Tang Ying Yen, the former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong and candidate for Chief Executive in 2012.[2]
Political and community leader[edit]
Tang's position inside the standing community placed him in lead positions on a number of boards and committees. He had an important role in Hong Kong's transfer of power from the UK to China in the years leading up to 1997. His business ventures included managing director of SOCO Textiles (Hong Kong) Ltd., chairman of Peninsula Knitters Ltd. of Hong Kong, general manager of Xinjiang Tianshan Woolen Fabric Co, Ltd. and general manager of Shanghai United Woolentex Group and Guandong Lianfa Woolen Fabric Co. Ltd.[citation needed]
His community work included chairman of the Hong Kong Textile Trade Union, member of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and vice-chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. During the reversion of Hong Kong to China, he served on the PRC Consultative Committee on Basic Law, on the first group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisors, on the Preparatory Committee for Hong Kong SAR and on the Selection Committee for the first Hong Kong SAR government.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Tang Hsiang Chien

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Tang.





Tang Hsiang Chien


Chinese
唐翔千





Transcriptions


Standard Mandarin


Hanyu Pinyin
Táng Xiángqiān








Leo Tang Hsiang Chien, GBS, OBE, JP (born June 8, 1923, Shanghai) was a member of the Standing Committee of the 7–9th CPPCC National Committee.
Tang graduated from Utopia University in Shanghai in 1945 and received a master's degree from Illinois State University in 1948. He moved to Hong Kong in 1950.[1] He is the father of Henry Tang Ying Yen, the former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong and candidate for Chief Executive in 2012.[2]
Political and community leader[edit]
Tang's position inside the standing community placed him in lead positions on a number of boards and committees. He had an important role in Hong Kong's transfer of power from the UK to China in the years leading up to 1997. His business ventures included managing director of SOCO Textiles (Hong Kong) Ltd., chairman of Peninsula Knitters Ltd. of Hong Kong, general manager of Xinjiang Tianshan Woolen Fabric Co, Ltd. and general manager of Shanghai United Woolentex Group and Guandong Lianfa Woolen Fabric Co. Ltd.[citation needed]
His community work included chairman of the Hong Kong Textile Trade Union, member of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and vice-chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. During the reversion of Hong Kong to China, he served on the PRC Consultative Committee on Basic Law, on the first group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisors, on the Preparatory Committee for Hong Kong SAR and on the Selection Committee for the first Hong Kong SAR government.[3]

The Chinese University of Hong Kong

                    Founded in 1963, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is a forward-looking comprehensive research university with a global vision and a mission to combine tradition with modernity, and to bring together China and the West. CUHK teachers and students hail from all around the world. CUHK graduates are connected worldwide through an extensive alumni network.

As a top university in Hong Kong and Asia, CUHK aims to nurture students with both specialized knowledge and wisdom for life. The education experience here is distinguished by a flexible credit unit system, a college system, bilingualism and multiculturalism. There are general education courses to broaden students' perspectives and develop in them the ability to face the challenges of contemporary society. Our eight Faculties offer a wide array of excellent undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.

CUHK undertakes a wide range of research programmes in many subject areas, and strives to provide scope for all academic staff to undertake consultancy and collaborative projects with industry. The University's insistence on the highest standards of research has won it an enviable research reputation. Hong Kong's University Grants Committee (UGC) provides preferential grant funding to the local tertiary institutions to conduct research into 18 selected Areas of Excellence (AoEs). Seven of these AoEs are being led by researchers from CUHK. The University houses four state key laboratories which are entrusted by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China to produce research of international quality and carry out important national research tasks. The University also has an excellent record of published research, both in discipline-specific journals and in more high-profile publications such as Science, Nature, and The Lancet.

Of all Hong Kong universities, CUHK is the only one that offers a college experience. To our constituent colleges, Chung Chi, New Asia, United and Shaw, have recently been added Morningside, S.H. Ho, C.W. Chu, Wu Yee Sun and Lee Woo Sing, bring up the total number of colleges to nine. College programmes and activities complement the formal curricula by delivering whole-person education and pastoral care. The college system also encourages intimate interaction among teachers, students and alumni.

Our beautiful 137.3-hectare campus overlooking Tolo Harbour is the largest and greenest in Hong Kong. It houses a range of facilities essential for an all-round campus experience, such as world-class libraries, art museums, music halls, swimming pool, sports fields, tennis courts, squash courts, water sports centre and gymnasiums.
