        Beautiful rug very soft
This rug is good size for a bedroom or medium sized t.v. room. The red is bright and the rug is soft enough to sleep on.

                    The area that will be discussed in this local insight is at Woodrow and Gettysburg. I currently live in this neighborhood in a 3bd 2.5ba condo and I love it.

This area is the ideal location for anyone that likes to walk places because of all of the business that surround the area. There is the new development across from Fresno State with the Maya Movie Theater and the abundance of delicious restaurants including DogHouse. Costco and Winco are also a short drive away at Ashlan and Peach which makes that weekly shopping trip less of a errand. 

The best part of living in this neighborhood though is when the SaveMart Center is having a show you can walk there and back without paying for parking and dealing with the traffic. Also, when Fresno State is having a football game you can bypass all that traffic as well.

Evaluation of trap capture in a geographically closed population of brown treesnakes on GuamProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2009Author(s): Tyrrell, C.L., M.T. Christy, G.H. Rodda, A.A. Yackel Adams, A.R. Ellingson, J.A. Savidge, K. Dean-Bradley, and R. BischofSuggested Citation: Tyrrell, C.L., M.T. Christy, G.H. Rodda, A.A. Yackel Adams, A.R. Ellingson, J.A. Savidge, K. Dean-Bradley, and R. Bischof. 2009. Evaluation of trap capture in a geographically closed population of brown treesnakes on Guam. Journal of Applied Ecology. 46(1): 128-135. Open population mark-recapture analysis of unbounded populations accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration, immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested empirically…
