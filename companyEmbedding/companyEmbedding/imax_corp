FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Management








RICHARD L. GELFOND
Chief Executive Officer






              Richard (Rich) Gelfond is chief executive officer of IMAX Corporation, one of the world's leading entertainment technology companies.  Under his leadership, IMAX has evolved from a niche purveyor of nature and science documentaries to a Hollywood movie force — both as high-tech exhibitor and a creative partner in the movie-making process.
 
IMAX has more than 1,215 theatres in 75 countries (including more than 264 theatres in Greater China). IMAX presented some of 2016’s top movies including Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. In 2017, IMAX is expecting a blockbuster year from tent poles films including The Fate of the Furious, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Transformers: The Last Knight and Dunkirk. 
 
Under Gelfond’s leadership, IMAX entered China more than 15 years ago just as the nation’s entertainment, film and exhibition industry was developing. Growing as it did alongside the industry, IMAX has become a key part of the nation’s movie-going culture. Today, China is IMAX’s second-largest and fastest-growing market and is embraced by audiences across the country as the best and most immersive way to see a film.
 
Gelfond, one of entertainment’s longest-tenured executives, joined IMAX in 1994 as co-chairman after his firm, Cheviot Capital Advisors, bought the company. Gelfond previously served as an investment banker in mergers and acquisitions with Drexel Burnham Lambert.  
 
Gelfond holds a BA from Stony Brook University and a law degree from Northwestern University.
 
Gelfond is a member of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts & Science.  In 1996, Gelfond and investment partner Brad Wechsler received an Academy Award on behalf of IMAX for Scientific and Technical Achievement.
