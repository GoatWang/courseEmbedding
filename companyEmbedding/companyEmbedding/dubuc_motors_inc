MONTREAL — For a region that has never had an automotive manufacturing sector and where winters are too harsh for most sports cars, Quebec City-based Dubuc Motors says it was surprisingly easy to find local sources for almost all the parts it needed to build a high-performance electric vehicle.
[np_storybar title=”How equity crowdfunding works” link=””]
StartEngine, and other online platforms like it, facilitates the U.S. JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startup) Act, which allows private companies to connect with investors for the funds they need.
Sometimes described as helping a company do a “mini IPO,” StartEngine begins by sourcing public interest in the company for anywhere between 90 and 120 days. During that time, those who want to invest put in a non-binding reservation.
If there is enough interest, the company sets a price per share and those with a reservation are first in line to buy shares, while StartEngine charges a fee on transactions. 
After the offering, the shares are traded not on the stock market, but on exchanges set up through platforms like StartEngine. 
The difference between equity crowdfunding and other crowdfunding platforms is that while Kickstarter and Indiegogo source donations in exchange for rewards or perks, the JOBS Act allows companies to raise capital by actually selling shares. 
And, while investors can come from anywhere in the world, this is a U.S. government initiative for U.S. startups and companies from only one other country are allowed to participate in the program — Canada.
This type of fundraising wasn’t always possible. The U.S. Security Exchange Commission only approved equity crowdfunding for Title 4 — so-called Regulation A+ — companies like Dubuc Motors in March 2015.
Qualified companies are then able to raise up to US$50 million a year, which is a far cry from the maximum $1.5 million in equity crowdfunding also approved last year in several Canadian provinces, including Quebec.
So far, only one company has completed a Reg A+ equity crowdfunding campaign: another vehicle maker called Elio Motors, which had US$47 million in reservations and ultimately sold US$16 million in equity to build a three-wheeled gas-powered car.
Right now Dubuc Motors has begun the both exciting and nerve-racking stage where it is sourcing interest from potential investors. 
“(Raising that much money) requires that it’s a big vision and it has to have some meaningful beneficial impact on the world,” says Ron Miller, CEO of StartEngine. “By bringing this company into existence, we’re going to do something to make the world better.” [/np_storybar]
What has really proven difficult for the company is sourcing Canadian investors to help take its Tomahawk electric sports car from a prototype to the consumer market.
After years spent seeking financing close to home, Dubuc Motors is looking south, becoming the first electric vehicle company in the world to launch a car through the U.S.’s very new equity crowdfunding program.
“Nobody wanted to invest in cars in Quebec,” said cofounder and company chief executive Mario Dubuc. “We wanted to prove that our technology was different and we could make it.”
On Friday Dubuc Motors began their campaign to raise money through StartEngine, one of a handful of online platforms that facilitates the U.S. JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startup) Act, which allows private companies to connect with investors for the funds they need. 
Dubuc and business partner Mike Kakogiannakis met in Moncton, N.B., where Dubuc’s wife ran a chip wagon near Kakogiannakis’ wife’s ice cream parlour. The two bonded over their mutual love of cars and, although neither had formal experience with the automotive industry, in 2004 began designing the Tomahawk electric sports car part time.
Kakogiannakis, 33, says he believes Tesla Motors Inc. “paved the way” for the electric car market in North America and gave the industry a credibility it needed.
The Tomahawk looks like a hybrid between a Dodge Viper and a Tesla Model S, with a hint of Lamborghini. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in three seconds and has a top speed of more than 250 km/h — higher than those in the Tesla line. It also has a bonded aluminium chassis invented by the Dubuc Motors team, something Kakogiannakis saiys he was inspired to create after he took up flying planes. 
Four years ago the entrepreneurs made the leap to work full time on the car.
Every component of the Tomahawk is sourced from within 45 minutes of the company’s Quebec City facility, Kakogiannakis says, except the windshield, battery and tires. 
What was difficult locally, was finding either government support or investors willing to put up capital for the company.
Dubuc says for two years the company tried to find funding in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.
“All the time it was ‘no’ and closed doors. When I started everybody thought that I was a fool because nobody was making cars in Quebec,” Dubuc says.
“The reason it took (us) 12 years is, I believe, that society wasn’t ready,” Kakogiannakis says “In 2004 when we were talking about this, people looked at us very strangely.” 
Still, Tesla’s brushes with bankruptcy have drawn unfavourable comparisons when Dubuc Motors approached venture capital firms, making it difficult to secure funding.
“They don’t seem to think about how (Tesla) was the first one on the planet to come out with an electric car, the hurdles they had to go through and the naysayers along the way,” says Kakogiannakis, who is also Dubuc Motors’ chief operating officer.
He says at first he worried the company was doing something wrong in the way it sought financing, before learning that even Tesla CEO Elon Musk was unable to secure venture capital in the early stages. 


Francis Vachon for National Post


“I realized that he laid it on the line himself, while he had a lot more capital and stature than we did. If he didn’t find (VC funding), what were the chances that we would?”
So far, the company has spent more than a million dollars developing the Tomahawk, sourced entirely through Kakogiannakis and Dubuc’s personal resources, in addition to some “love money” along the way. 
“My paycheque for the past three years has been zero,” says 51-year-old Dubuc, who began working on cars out of personal interest at 14. “I didn’t want to be 70 years old and regret that I didn’t do this.”
That drive led Dubuc Motors to StartEngine, which is helping the company take advantage of the JOBS Act, a process sometimes described as being like a “mini IPO.” 
Kakogiannakis says the target is to raise $15 million for a minority stake in the company, somewhere around 10 per cent, though the final amount would depend on how investors react to the initial campaign.

Because the Tomahawk is designed to be the only “2+2”-seat (built for the driver and one passenger in the front plus two smaller seats in the rear) electric sports car, Dubuc Motors believes this is a demand not currently being met.
Kakogiannakis says although Tesla’s current line of cars may look sporty, the target market is not the same as those who would be in the market for a high-performance roadster.  
“We wanted to develop a product that wouldn’t compete with the big automakers. If we were to do that we would get hammered,” he said. “What we’re trying to do is complete Tesla’s line, not compete with it.”
This car is not for everyone in either the electric or combustion engine realm, as Dubuc Motors is aiming for wealthy customers who want a flashy, fast car.


Handout/ Dubuc Motors


The Tomahawk is expected to be ready for market in 2017 with a price tag of about $110,000, which is not cheap but is still in the realm of the cost for a new Tesla. 
Right now, Dubuc Motors has about a dozen employees, but Kakogiannakis says after this capital-raising campaign it hopes to expand to 140 by the time production begins in 2017.
The company goal is to sell 1,500 units a year, starting with 200 in 2017, and it has already started taking pre-orders from as far away as Asia, Europe and South Africa. 
Although there is a long way to go before production reaches this stage, Dubuc says the potential of seeing his lifelong dream materialize after more than a decade of dedication makes it hard to contain his enthusiasm.  
“I’m very excited about it, but I want to stay focused and see what will happen,” he said.
“It’s like playing with a slot machine and winning the jackpot, but not being able to take it right now.”

                                    Dubuc Motors is a pioneer OEM within the  BEV industry. I had the chance to cooperate with Mike. His work, his approach but also his vision proves the tremendous increase and growth that Dubuc Motors will follow. 
I am waiting to see Dubuc's success but also company's future plans. 
Keep up your excellent work.

                                    Innovation could be applied in different aspects within our community. If the community itself is unwilling to lend support, this could restrict any progress. Within projects involving innovation, one needs to accept that there could be a number of obstacles that are out of our control and many individuals that will not help the its development for any particular reason. 

It is evident that what Mr. Kakogiannakis and his fellow colleagues at Dubuc Motors are trying to accomplish, and will succeed in doing, is taking a step towards the future. What they are promoting is self-efficiency in order to free the population from their dependence on fossil fuels. They are helping the environment by eliminating the release of Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere, which in turn have a domino effect on our surroundings. It is inevitable that eventually we will run out of possibilities and a solution will be needed. This is the solution of the future! Be aware and open-minded. Help the cause!

                                    Mike is a great entrepreneur and has inovative ideas...combined with Mario's talent and vision they can only succeed. Awsome work! A++++++++++++++++++                                












Gilbert Saint-Jean



                                    I've known Mike for 30 years and I also know that climate change is a reality we have to deal with now! Entrepreneurs like these dedicated fine gentlemen will push the governments ever more so to address the pollution problem that is causing so many illnesses and that is destroying our planet. I applaud them for taking a bold stand on what so many are afraid to tackle. Mike and Mario are definitely a team that can give birth to this wonderful line of products which is beneficial to both the consumer and the economy. It would be wise for any government to support such a great product created and manufactured here, in Canada! Mike has always been an extremely dedicated and hard working person, my recommendation is easy!                                












Pierre Lavoie



                                    Après avoir vu le prototype Tomahawk, je suis emballé par votre projet et je suis confiant que vous allez developper un véhicule électrique performant et de qualité. 
Dubuc Motors a tous les atouts pour être un joueur clé afin de mener à bien l'électrification des transports au Québec et au Canada. Bon succès !                                












Barbara Paquette



                                    Electric supercars are the next step in the evolution of the electric car.  Dubuc Motors is the company to revolutionize the industry.  This company has what it takes to succeed. Lead by Mike and Mario two dynamic and passionate individuals who are determined to make their dream a reality.  I have known Mike personally for over 30 years.  His drive, perseverance, and commitment are second to none.  There are great things to come from this team, of that I am sure!                                












Marie-Anne Paquette



                                    Mike and Mario are trailblazers in the world of electric supercars. Mike's vision combined with Mario's creativity make for a fierce team.  They are two highly motivated individuals driven by an unstoppable passion to create a world class vehicle.  Knowing this team's "drive" it won't be long before we see the Tomahawk on our roads.  Dubuc Motors is THE company to watch for innovation and success!                                












Patrick Simard



                                    Nice vision, great opportunity right now with the actual  orientation of the Quebec government to promote electric cars, lets hope the company keep it's heart in Quebec, as well as his suppliers! :)  Keep up the good work! Great designs!                                 












Philippe Branch



                                    The next big thing! Great vision! Good product                                












Christos Petsinis



                                    A Canadian first! This company is electrifying in every way, bringing value, employment opportunities and contributing in a big way to environmental issues we face today. I do not only recommend Dubuc Motors...I commend them for their cool green initiation. Mike is a trusted by all and has always delivered, looking forward to seeing the next electric supercar.













Nicholas Paradis



                                    Brilliant company putting brilliant vehicles on our planet!  Thank you Dubuc                                












Les Evans



                                    As a global business coach and speaker, I've heard a lot of people talk about innovation and creativity. All too often it is just that - talk. When I met Mike I was immediately impressed with his drive and vision, and those are two words that I do not hand out lightly. Elon Musk might be taking on the world on the high end electric model, but what about the "rest of us" who want a electric supercar with out the super price tag?! It's about darn time somebody scratched this itch!                                












Hadi B



                                    Based on my observation of his abilities, I strongly believe Mike has the potential to be an outstanding leader in this innovative technology.                                 












George Xanthoudakis



                                    Although im not surprised im still pretty amazed with the concept of this car !! I have known Mike for almost 20 years now, since his early teens Mike had shown that he has an innovating entrepreneurial mind heart and soul !!
keep up the good work Mike !!                                












Brook Justin Ewert



                                    A very easy recommendation, Mike has all the necessary hallmark traits of an entrepreneur that succeeds in whatever he does. Work ethic, tenacity, experience, connections, and most importantly unstoppable passion. Excited to see what the next couple years has in store for Dubuc Motors and their team. Expecting nothing but big things.                                












Francesco Miele



                                    J'ai la chance de connaître Mike depuis plus de 20 ans. Je reconnais en lui la même personne, déterminée et passionnée prête à pousser les limites toujours plus loin. C'est de ce genre d'entrepreneur que le Québec a besoin, dont l'ambition pour le renouveau et l'excellence est palpable. Il sait s'entourer de bonnes personnes afin de pouvoir livrer un produit de qualité, à la fois innovateur et bon pour l'environnement prenant sa source de nos matières premières locales. À travers ses diverses instances, le Québec a souvent donné sa chance à des incubateurs et certains de ceux ci sont devenus aujourd'hui des géants, vrais fleurons de notre savoir faire. Il est fort probable que nous soyons devant deux entrepreneurs qui continueront de nous rendre fiers et dont leur produit fera l'envie du monde. Je souhaite longue vie à Dubuc Motors et surtout je les remercie pour leur audace qui fera tomber les barrières. Francesco Miele, Montréal                                












Redouane Mekideche



                                    I recently had a chance to see the Tomahawk demo vehicles and talk to the owners of Dubuc Motors.  The vehicle is really in a category of its own in terms of style and functionality. Not mentioning the fact that it is 100% electric which makes it really appealing. The owners are really dynamic, a good mix of creativity, ingenuity and strong business acumen. I hope to see many of Tomahawks on North American roads in a not too distant future.                                












Carlos Marques



                                    I call them ,the  green team with the absolut  green machine..
This is the future car for Quebec. Mike and his team will aspire to achieve great heights...

                                    Il faut absolument garder tous ses efforts au Québec. Notre belle province verte avec notre hydro-électricité.

J'espère être dans les premiers clients...                                












Nicolas Dion



                                    We need to keep all those efforts in Quebec, the Green Province!

                                    Je  vois une voiture Canadienne et Électrique qui a des spécifications techniques extra-ordianaires. J'espère que  vous reussissiez, et que votre projet atteint un sommet mondiale.   Bonne chance a votre équipe.                                












Kosta Kopitas



                                    I've known Mike for over 5 years and his drive and passion are what it takes to bring this project to life. Never seen anyone so committed  and pationate to develop this type of vehicle  and couldn't think of anyone better to lead this project                                












Costa Tsimiklis



                                    Mike is an excellent entrepreneur with vision and the motivation to get things done! I have seen the product first hand and it is all it promises and more!

                                     As a independent business person here in Quebec I I highly recommend anyone with vision  to support this project. These two young men and their project are creating a great identity for Quebec and a positive impact on our environment ..... great things to come I am confident

 Employee at Dubuc Motors


                                    Great project, great team!

                                    Tout commence par un rêve... Mon prochain est de conduire la TOMAHAWK. 

Une réalisation exemplaire de deux hommes passionnés de chez nous Mario Dubuc et Mike Kakogiannakis. Sexy, unique et en plus ÉLECTRIQUE !!!! 

À chacun sa course! 

Isabelle                                 












A. Peter Relan
 Advisor at Dubuc Motors


                                    Mike is a missionary entrepreneur, and combined with Mario's ingenuity, he has the right ingredients to succeed. They have successfully identified an open segment in the electric car market, and have convinced me that their product is differentiated and will have some initial demand. For potential investors the key question is: can their model scale? But that is the point of early stage investment: to make a bet that good founders can crack the problems of getting the model to a point that it can scale. And then get the additional financing needed to scale it.                                












Christopher Calado
 Logistics Coordinator at Dubuc Motors


                                    Mike is a talented and determined individual. He and his team have developed an amazing product which needs to be pursued because products like this are lacking in our daily lives.
