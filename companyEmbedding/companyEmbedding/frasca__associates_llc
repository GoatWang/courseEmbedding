FRASCA & ASSOCIATES is dedicated to helping our airport clients establish "best in class"
	financial practices, so that they can realize their goal of providing superior facilities and services
	to their customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Frasca & Associates, L.L.C. is a financial consulting firm with specialty expertise in assisting

	programs, lease negotiation for facilities with airlines and other airport tenants, and developing
	public/private partnerships.  The firm is also nationally recognized as an expert in the structure

	airport finance at a major investment bank,  one of the industry's most senior airport ratings
	analysts and the former business manager at one of the world's largest airport systems. The result
	is a comprehensive view of the issues, from a capital markets, an operations, and a business 
	development perspective.

Frasca and Associates, LLC Staff Bios -- Doreen Frasca


































Doreen M. Frasca
Principal

dfrasca@frascallc.com
  
Ms. Frasca specializes in the structuring and financing of airport,
airport access and other transportation related projects.

In 1997, Ms. Frasca formed Frasca & Associates to provide advisory and
strategic consulting services for airports and airport tenants, including
airlines and concessionaires. She spent the previous 20 years of her
career on Wall Street, initially at Dillon, Read & Co. Inc., on the
municipal bond trading desk as a dollar bond trader, and then at Merrill
Lynch & Co., where she spent 15 years in the Public Finance Division,
ultimately heading the Airports and Transportation Group.  Throughout her
career, Ms. Frasca has assisted her clients in evaluating the financial
feasibility of project financings, structuring financing plans, and
accessing the taxable and tax-exempt markets.  She has financed in excess
of $12 billion in projects for U.S. airports as well as innovative
financial products such as swaps and GICs.


In a relatively short period of time, Frasca & Associates has moved to
the forefront of helping airports access the lowest cost of debt attainable,
adopt 'best practices' in the management and operation of their facilities,
and develop strategies to improve financial performance, enhance customer
service and access new sources of funding.

Ms. Frasca's career airport financing experience includes:  San Diego International Airport  (refunding and commercial paper issuances), Houston
Intercontinental (restructuring of all outstanding indebtedness), Miami
International (first commercial paper program for a U.S. airport), Metropolitan
Washington - National and Dulles International (financial structure of a newly
constituted authority), Chicago O'Hare, Hartsfield Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth,
Cyril E. King, Huntsville, Sarasota, Reno, Las Vegas, Norfolk and Providence.
She worked extensively with the following airline clients on the financing of
terminal and other on-airport facilities:  American Airlines, (maintenance base
at Alliance Airport and AAirTram rail system at DFW), Delta Air Lines (LaGuardia
terminal), United Airlines (O'Hare terminals), USAirways (LaGuardia and Charlotte
terminals), Continental Airlines (LaGuardia and Houston terminals), and BAA USA,
Inc. (strategic U.S. advisory assignment including quantitative analyses related
to Indianapolis Airport). She also advised on the privatization of Stewart International Airport and the commercialization of Terminal 4 at JFK International. 

Ms. Frasca earned a B.A. in History, magna cum laude, from Wheaton College (Norton, MA) where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.  She pursued graduate studies in History at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and received an M.B.A. in Finance from Columbia University.  She was appointed a Commissioner of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) (2008-2011), where she chaired the Transit Committee. She also served as a Trustee of the New-York Historical Society (1996-2002) and as the National Co-Chair of the Women's Campaign Fund, a bi-partisan PAC.
