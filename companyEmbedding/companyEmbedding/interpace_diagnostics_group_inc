Information for Patients
Do features point to benign disease?Dina H. – 50 year old female patientHistory

Married, working mother of 2 teenagers
Evaluation of a body/tail junction cyst
1.8 cm x 1.6 cm
Consists of a single compartment without communication with the pancreatic ductal system
Outer wall thin
Mural nodule
No evidence of chronic pancreatitis
Fluid aspirated from cyst showed abundant extracellular mucin
Presence of macrophages
Debris and rare groups of benign-appearing ductal cells
No evidence of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy

Clinical Considerations 

Many features point to benign disease
Mural nodule creates significant concern that cancer may be present
CEA and cytology provide insufficient support to discriminate between benign vs aggressive disease

This Patient





Molecular analysis indicates BENIGN biologic behavior
Surgery not performed
Patient has been followed for over 48 months without clinical evidence of progression

Surgery or surveillance?Kelly G. – 86 year old female patientHistory

Widow, lives alone, 6 grandchildren
Cystic lesion in head of the pancreas
Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a complex head cyst
3.1 cm x 2.1 cm
Composed of tubular structures in continuity with the main pancreatic duct as well as a side branch
No solid component, no nodules, no masses
Aspirate fluid had thick, mucinous character
Cytology exam revealed markedly degenerated specimen with atypical ductal cells and focal extracellular mucin
Degeneration precludes definitive evaluation

Clinical Considerations 

Large size raises possibility of aggressive disease
Qualifies for surgical resection
Cytologic atypia adds to concern
Advanced age encourages a conservative approach

GNAS Point MutationNo mutation detect


Tumor Suppressor Genes (LOH)No LOH detected



Outcomes



BenignStatistically IndolentStatistically Higher RiskAggressive


This Patient





Molecular analysis supports STATISTICALLY INDOLENT disease
This patient exemplifies a common finding in pancreatic cyst lesions: molecular alterations occur early in the molecular pathogenesis of this disease, and thus are the most helpful when first-line testing shows changes of a mild-to-moderate nature
While mutational change is detected, the extent is still within the range seen with benign or non-progressive disease
Patient continues to do well under surveillance for 56 months

Is testing the solid component enough?Larry T. – 76 year old male patientHistory

Retired, divorced, recently moved to the area
3.0 cm hypoechoic mass in mid-body of the pancreas adjacent to a 2.5 cm anechoic cystic mass
No adenopathy
Changes suggestive of chronic pancreatitis detected
Upstream dilation of the pancreatic duct
Multiple additional cysts present in the pancreas w/ thin walls and no mural nodules
Both the hypoechoic lesion and the anechoic cyst lesion were biopsied

Clinical Considerations 

After sampling the solid component, cytology failed to find evidence of malignancy

The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's PurpleStride Events Raise Funds and Awareness for the Deadliest Major Cancer

PARSIPPANY, N.J., July  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Interpace Diagnostics (Nasdaq:IDXG) has joined the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) to raise critical funds and awareness for pancreatic cancer through the Pittsburgh PurpleStride Event. Employees and their families have united to create Team Interpace with a goal of raising $5,000 to support PanCAN's mission to advance research, support patients and create hope.
The Pittsburgh PurpleStride Event, a 5K walk, will take place on September 9th at the Northshore RiverFront Park. This community event is planned by volunteers of PanCAN and will pay tribute to loved ones who have succumbed to pancreatic cancer, as well as honor those who are currently fighting it.
"Our employees in Pittsburgh are dedicated to providing diagnostic insights to physicians and patients at risk for developing pancreatic cancer," said Jack Stover, President and CEO of Interpace. "Our focus in helping these patients aligns well with the objectives of PanCAN, and we are proud to participate in this important cause," he added. 
As the leading pancreatic cancer organization, PanCAN is working to expedite progress, improve patient outcomes and double survival by 2020 through key initiatives like Precision PromiseSM and Know Your Tumor®.  The PanCAN has raised more than $87 million for this cause through community events from 2008 to 2016.
This year, an estimated 53,670 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and approximately 43,090 will die from the disease. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is just nine percent.
The Pittsburgh PurpleStride event aims to improve patient outcomes by raising significant funds for PanCAN this year.
To learn more about the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network or PanCAN and how you can make a difference, visit www.pancan.org.
About PancraGEN®
PancraGEN® is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that, by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid, can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment. PancraGEN® is 90% accurate, according to clinical studies, enabling effective risk stratification of patients.  Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced. Because of this, and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible, pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.
About Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.
Interpace Diagnostics is a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management. The Company currently has three commercialized molecular tests; PancraGEN® for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer; ThyGenX, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a next generation sequencing assay and ThyraMIR®, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. Interpace Diagnostics' mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science.
About the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) is accelerating the pace of research progress for one of the world's deadliest cancers. With an urgent mission to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients and double survival by 2020, the organization, founded in 1999, executes a bold and comprehensive strategy to Wage Hope through research, patient services, advocacy and community engagement. The organization's visionary goals, world-class programs and services, extensive grassroots network, patient-focused outcomes and advisory board of scientific and medical leaders, provide the critical backdrop to help pancreatic cancer patients today and create transformational change for all patients in the future.

(IDXG), a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services, announced today the acceptance of four posters to be presented at the upcoming United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) meeting being held March 4-10, 2017 in San Antonio, Texas.The posters reflect a review of data from the Company's extensive experience in molecular thyroid testing, including experience with over 5000 analyses of indeterminate thyroid nodules using its combined mutational (ThyGenX®) and microRNA classifier (ThyraMIR®) testing format. Fundamental insights into the mechanism of thyroid cancer development and progression are reported as well as a comprehensive statistical analysis of the mutational and microRNA profiling features representing the largest integrated analysis of DNA and RNA alterations in existence for commercially available molecular products in the area of thyroid cancer.The United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) has been the most prestigious provider of continuing medical education (CME) for pathologists globally for more than a century, superbly integrating CME into the process for improving professional practice and patient outcomes by reducing the gap between evidence-based practices and adoption of those practices into clinical care.  The organization boasts a membership of 10,000 Pathologists and other practitioners committed to this goal. The accepted posters that will be presented at the conference are entitled "The Role of miRNA Expression Analysis in Needle Aspirate Cytology of Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules", "Clinical and Biological Significance of Common Mutational Genotypes of Thyroid Follicular Neoplasia", "Biological Aggressiveness of Thyroid Neoplasia Depends on the Strength of the Genetic Mutation and Associated Cellular Interaction", and "MicroRNA Profiling Complements Microscopic/Mutational Analysis by Defining Alternative Pathways of Carcinogenesis." According to Jack Stover, President & CEO of Interpace, "We are pleased that this work has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming USCAP meeting. The acceptance of these four posters by this prestigious international organization reflects the strength of our ongoing commitment to demonstrate the exceptional clinical utility of our tests globally."About Thyroid Nodules, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR testingAccording to the American Thyroid Association, approximately 15% to 30% of the 525,000 thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed on an annual basis in the U.S. are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation, and thus are candidates for ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR®.ThyGenX and ThyraMIR reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules.  The combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancer.ThyGenX utilizes state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify more than 100 genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, the two most common forms of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR is the first microRNA gene expression classifier.  MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that bind to messenger RNA and regulate expression of genes involved in human cancers, including every subtype of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR measures the expression of 10 microRNAs.  Both ThyGenX and ThyraMIR are covered by both Medicare and Commercial insurers. About Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.Interpace is a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management.

Jun 28 17
Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. announced that it has signed a new national contract with Aetna for its ThyGenX and ThyraMIR molecular tests for indeterminate thyroid nodules. The agreement covers many of Aetna's products, including commercial and Medicare Advantage plans. It does not include Medicaid, auto insurance, or workman's compensation products. The agreement goes into effect August 15, 2017. Aetna began covering ThyGenX in June 2015 and ThyraMIR in November 2016. The agreement is the company's first national provider contract with a national health plan and means that Interpace will now be part of Aetna's laboratory network for these services. The agreement with Aetna is another significant reimbursement milestone demonstrating its ability to convert its product coverage approvals with major insurance providers into successful contractual agreements.


Interpace Diagnostics Announces Coverage of Thyroid Test by Premera Blue Cross in US
Jun 26 17
Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. has announced that Premera Blue Cross has agreed to cover its ThyraMIR test for all of its more than 2 million members located primarily in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. Interpace's ThyraMIR assay is now covered for thyroid nodules deemed indeterminate by standard cytopathological analysis. With the addition of Premera's members, ThyraMIR is now covered for over 250 million patients nationwide, including through Medicare, National, and Regional health plans. The Company also recently announced coverage of ThyraMIR by United Healthcare and Aetna. The ThyGenX - ThyraMIR combination represents the only test in the market that includes the rule-in properties of next-generation sequencing of a patient's DNA and RNA along with the rule-out capabilities of a micro-RNA classifier to provide physicians with clinically actionable test results. Based on current performance, approximately 90% of the Company's ThyGenX cases are reflexed to ThyraMir for additional assessment.


Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. Announces Agreement with Einstein Medical Center of Philadelphia
Jun 5 17
Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. announced that the company has entered into a Laboratory Services Agreement with Einstein Medical Center of Philadelphia (Einstein) to provide expanded laboratory analytical services to Einstein for improved identification of indeterminate thyroid nodules, through Interpace's combined ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® molecular tests. The new Agreement provides access for Einstein’s Endocrinologists, Ear Nose and Throat physicians, and Otolaryngologists to Interpace’s products for thyroid nodules that are initially deemed indeterminate. Nationwide, approximately 20% of thyroid nodules assessed using fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies are indeterminate and eligible for further analysis with molecular testing. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has published guidelines that support the use of molecular testing in those circumstances where traditional cytopathology is indeterminate and unable to differentiate between malignant and benign thyroid nodules.

BarreGen utilizes an assay that assesses loss of heterozygosity and genetic mutations of multiple tumor-suppressor genes.  A longitudinal study shows the BarreGen test had an overall accuracy of 95% in identifying patients who progressed to cancer from those who did not.       http://www.ascopost.com/News/29620   PancraGEN® is a unique, DNA-based pancreatic cyst molecular test that, by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid, can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment. PancraGEN® is 90% accurate, according to clinical studies, enabling effective risk stratification of patients.  Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced. Because of this, and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible, pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.  Long-term follow-up outcomes data of patients (up to 8 years) from the National Pancreatic Cyst Registry supports PancraGEN’s ability to help accurately inform surgery and surveillance decisions of patients. In a study of the National Pancreatic Cyst Registry, PancraGEN’s recommendation of surveillance was correct in 97% of patients. In fact, PancraGEN diagnoses were more beneficial to overall patient outcomes than sole reliance on International Consensus Guidelines (ICG) criteria. PancraGEN has been performed on over 25,000 patients with pancreatic cysts, representing a full spectrum of pancreatic cyst patients with diverse clinical and molecular findings.  Medical Publications proving benefits of PancraGen: http://www.interpacediagnostics.com/pancragen/publications/  ThyGenX® Thyroid Oncogene Panel and ThyraMIR™ Thyroid miRNA Classifier molecular testing that aids in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules by identifying genetic alterations associated with thyroid cancer.  ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR™ combination testing helps to better assess the risk of thyroid nodules being either benign or malignant—and helps reduce unnecessary surgeries. ThyGenX® is a highly specific oncogene (mutational) panel that assesses the most common genetic alterations across 8 genes associated with papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma. ThyraMIR™ is the first and only miRNA gene expression classifier, and is based on evaluation of expression of 10 miRNAs. Interpace Diagnostics' ThyGenX™ Thyroid Oncogene Panel molecular diagnostic test is used to improve surgical decision-making for patients with thyroid nodules when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis of thyroid cancer. ThyGenX assists physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant indeterminate thyroid nodules by utilizing state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify more than 100 genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, the two most common forms of thyroid malignancies. The ThyGenX panel design is based on the miRInform® test, whose high predictive value has been validated in a recent prospective clinical study involving over 600 patients. Interpace Diagnostics acquired the miRInform test from Asuragen in 2014, and has now enhanced it by upgrading to a NGS platform which provides greater genomic insights and increased panel content.  Better than the competition: "RE: our Thyroid products, customers continue to be receptive to our combined ThyGenX/ThyraMir assay and we are viewed positively vs. the other products in the market, including Afirma, ThyroSeq2, and Rosetta.  We will also be launching enhancements to our Thyroid offering in the next few weeks."  Greg Richard (email 9-21-16)     AccuCEA™  AccuCEA is our highly accurate CEA method designed specifically for pancreatic cyst fluids and is especially convenient when used with PancraGEN.  Interpace currently performs over 6,000 AccuCEA tests per year for their customers.  CEA is a blood fluid chemistry test that is commonly done as part of an initial screening performed on patients suspected of having pancreatic and other types of cancer. -The only CEA assay validated for use on small volumes (200uL) of cyst fluid. -Delivers accurate CEA measurements on pancreatic cyst fluids -Offers physicians more options – reserve cyst fluid for other diagnostic tests -Results reported within 1-3 business days  New Version of AccuCEA™ Called "Insights" Provides Physicians Access to 15,000 Patient Database:  The new AccuCEA Insights service provides physicians for whom the Company has already provided first line testing, with additional information on how those results compare to those of other patients in the Company's proprietary database of over 15,000 patients, thus reporting incremental and valuable information on the patient's potential molecular profile and overall risk for developing pancreatic cancer. When the report is delivered to the ordering physician, they have an opportunity to speak with one of the Company's expert molecular pathologists and discuss the potential benefits of conducting a full, molecular pathology review using PancraGen®, the Company's fully integrated product that considers all the results from first line testing, imaging, cytology, and molecular testing and stratifies the patient in one of 4 risk categories. Events/Presentations: 86th Annual Meeting of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) in Denver, Colorado  The first of the two posters entitled "Molecular Analysis of Thyroid Malignancy Using Cytology Smears by Combined THYGENX™ and THYRAMIR™ testing: A Prospective Study" highlights the clinical performance of the combined ThyGenX + ThyraMIR tests when carried out on Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) material smeared on cytology slides.   The second poster entitled "The Majority of Non-Diagnostic (Insufficient) Thyroid Nodule Cytology Samples Can Effectively Undergo Molecular (Combined Mutational and MicroRNA Classifier) Analysis Using a Needle Aspiration Approach" demonstrates that Interpace's scientists were able to perform molecular analysis in cases where cytology results were insufficient.   Set for presentation of posters 50 and 51 on Sept 23: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/thy.2016.29027.abstracts  "DNA Analysis of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions Has Value in Assessing Risk of Future Malignancy" Oct 19, presented by:  James J.

PARSIPPANY, N.J., Aug. 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Interpace Diagnostics Group (NASDAQ:   IDXG), a company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management, reported today that the Company has launched a new version of their AccuCEA™ product called "Insights" for Gastroenterologists who focus on diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer.








The new AccuCEA Insights service provides physicians for whom the Company has already provided first line testing, with additional information on how those results compare to those of other patients in the Company's proprietary database of over 15,000 patients, thus reporting incremental and valuable information on the patient's potential molecular profile and overall risk for developing pancreatic cancer. When the report is delivered to the ordering physician, they have an opportunity to speak with one of the Company's expert molecular pathologists and discuss the potential benefits of conducting a full, molecular pathology review using PancraGen®, the Company's fully integrated product that considers all the results from first line testing, imaging, cytology, and molecular testing and stratifies the patient in one of 4 risk categories. 
Interpace Diagnostics, who has offered their AccuCEA product to customers for over 5 years, will continue to offer AccuCEA in addition to AccuCEA Insights. The primary benefit of the AccuCEA product vs. traditional carcinoembryonic antigen or CEA testing available from other labs is that AccuCEA is the only CEA assay that has been validated on small (200uL) amounts of cyst fluid. Interpace currently performs over 6,000 AccuCEA tests per year for their customers.  CEA is a blood fluid chemistry test that is commonly done as part of an initial screening performed on patients suspected of having pancreatic and other types of cancer.  This test, along with other common fluid chemistry tests like Amylase, may also be referred to as "first line testing". 
"The additional information provided via AccuCEA Insights provides physicians a more expansive view of their patient's status and enables them to make an informed decision regarding the most appropriate next steps," said Interpace President and CEO Jack Stover. "We believe customers who currently order first line testing services only will see the value in not only the incremental information provided via AccuCEA Insights but the full benefits of our fully integrated molecular product, PancraGEN."
About PancraGEN®
PancraGEN® is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that, by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid, can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment. PancraGEN® is 90% accurate, according to clinical studies, enabling effective risk stratification of patients.  Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced. Because of this, and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible, pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.
About Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.
Interpace Diagnostics provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management. The Company currently has three commercialized molecular tests: PancraGen® for the evaluation of pancreatic cysts and assessment of risk of concomitant or subsequent cancer;  ThyGenX®, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a next generation sequencing assay; and ThyraMIR®, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. Interpace Diagnostics mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. as amended (the Exchange Act). Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our plans, objectives, beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "should," "could," "may," "will" or similar words and expressions. These forward-looking statements are contained throughout this Form 10-Q.  Forward-looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions involving judgments about, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. These predictions are also affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following  ? our limited operating history as a molecular diagnostics company; ? our ability to obtain broad adoption of and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests in a changing reimbursement environment; ? whether we are able to successfully utilize our operating experience to sell our molecular diagnostic tests;  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  Please see Part I - Item 1A - "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from time-to-time, for other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations as expressed in the forward-looking statements discussed in this Form 10-Q. Because of these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. In addition, these statements speak only as of the date of the report in which they are set forth and, except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  OVERVIEW  We are a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services. We develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic tests and related first line assays principally focused on early detection of patients at high risk of cancer and leverage the latest technology and personalized medicine for improved patient diagnosis and management. We currently have three commercialized molecular diagnostic assays in the marketplace for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and multiple private payors: PancraGEN(R), a pancreatic cyst and pancreaticobiliary solid lesion molecular test that can aid in pancreatic cyst diagnosis and pancreatic cancer risk assessment utilizing our proprietary PathFinder platform? ThyGenX(R), which assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy? and ThyraMIR(R), which assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. We are also in the process of "soft launching" while we gather additional market data, BarreGEN(R), an esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett's Esophagus that utilizes our PathFinder platform.  Our mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science. We are leveraging our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratories to develop and commercialize our assays and products. We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genetic and other molecular mutations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer. Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics.  The global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to be $6.45 billion and is a segment within the approximately $60 billion in vitro diagnostics market. We believe that the molecular diagnostics market offers significant growth and strong patient value given the substantial opportunity it affords to lower healthcare costs by helping to reduce unnecessary surgeries and ensuring the appropriate frequency of monitoring. We are keenly focused on growing our test volumes, securing additional coverage and reimbursement, maintaining our current reimbursement and supporting revenue growth for our three commercialized innovative tests, introducing related first line product and service extensions, as well as expanding our business by developing and promoting synergistic products, like BarreGEN(R), in our market.  Additional Reimbursement Coverage During 2017  Reimbursement progress is key for any molecular diagnostic company. We made progress in obtaining both public and private reimbursement throughout 2016. We were successful in expanding the reimbursement of our products in 2016 and that has continued into 2017. Specifically we have made the following progress with payors in 2017:  ? In April 2017, we announced that UnitedHealthcare, the largest health plan in the United States, has agreed to cover our ThyraMIR(R) test used in assessing indeterminate thyroid nodule fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies. The coverage is now in effect and is subject to members' specific benefit plan design. OurThyGenX(R) and ThyraMIR assays are now covered for approximately 250 million patients nationwide, including through Medicare, National, and Regional health plans.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  Recent Equity Financings  From January 6, 2017 through February 8, 2017, we completed three public offerings of common stock and a private placement of warrants, which resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $12.2 million. A description of the financings is as follows:  ? On January 6, 2017, we completed a registered direct public offering, or the Second Registered Direct Offering, to sell 630,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.81 per share to certain institutional investors. The Second Registered Direct Offering resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $4.2 million. We are using the net proceeds from the Second Registered Direct Offering for working capital, repayment of indebtedness and general corporate purposes. In addition, we granted each institutional investor who participated in the Second Registered Direct Offering the right, for a period of 15 months following January 6, 2017, or until April 6, 2018, to participate in any public or private offering by us of equity securities, subject to certain exceptions, up to such investor's pro rata portion of 50% of the securities being offered.  ? On January 25, 2017, we completed a registered direct public offering, or the Third Registered Direct Offering, to sell 855,000 shares of our common stock and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase 855,000 shares of our common stock, or the Warrants, to the same investors participating in the Third Registered Direct Offering, (the Private Placement). The Warrants and the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants were not registered under the Securities Act and were sold pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The shares of common stock sold in the Third Registered Direct Offering and the Warrants issued in the concurrent Private Placement were issued separately but sold together at a combined purchase price of $4.69 per share of common stock and accompanying Warrant. The Third Registered Direct Offering and the Private Placement together resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $4 million. We are using the net proceeds from the Third Registered Direct Offering for working capital, repayment of indebtedness and general corporate purposes and also used approximately $1.0 million to satisfy the obligations due to the five former senior executives.  ? On February 8, 2017, we completed an underwritten, confidentially marketed public offering, or the CMPO, to sell 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $3.00 per share. In addition, we granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 9% of the total number of shares of common stock sold by us in the CMPO, solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full. The CMPO resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $3.9 million. We are using the proceeds from the CMPO for working capital, repayment of indebtedness and liabilities and for general corporate purposes.  DESCRIPTION OF REPORTING SEGMENTS  We currently operate under one operating segment, which is our molecular diagnostic business. Until December 22, 2015 prior to the sale of the CSO business, we operated under two reporting segments: Commercial Services and Interpace Diagnostics. The CSO business is reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  Interpace Diagnostics  We recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.  Our revenue is generated using our proprietary tests and related services. Our performance obligation is fulfilled upon the completion, review and release of test results. In conjunction with fulfilling these services, we bill the third-party payor or hospital. We recognize our revenue related to billings for Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and hospitals on an accrual basis, net of contractual adjustment, when a contract is in place, a reliable pattern of collectability exists and collectability is reasonably assured. Contractual adjustments represent the difference between the list prices and the reimbursement rate set by Medicare and Medicare Advantage, the contractual rate or the amounts agreed to with hospitals.  Until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial insurance carrier or governmental program, the services may or may not be covered by these entities existing reimbursement policies. In the absence of an agreement with the patient or other clearly enforceable legal right to demand payment, the related revenue is only recognized upon the earlier of payment notification or cash receipt. Accordingly, we recognize revenue from commercial insurance carriers, government programs, and direct-bill healthcare providers without contracts, when payment is received.  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery is deemed to have occurred upon completion, review, and release of the test results at which time we will bill the third-party payor or hospital. The assessment of the fixed or determinable nature of the fees charged for diagnostic testing performed, and the collectability of those fees, requires significant judgment by our management. Our management believes that these two criteria have been met when there is contracted reimbursement coverage or a predictable pattern of collectability with individual third-party payors or hospitals and accordingly, recognizes revenue upon delivery of the test results. In the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or a predictable pattern of collectability, we believe that the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured only upon request of third-party payor notification of payment or when cash is received, and we recognize revenue at that time.  Cost of services consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our laboratories and other costs directly related to our tests. Personnel costs, which constitute the largest portion of cost of services, include all labor related costs, such as salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits and payroll taxes for laboratory personnel. Other direct costs include, but are not limited to, laboratory supplies, certain consulting expenses, and facility expenses.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data. The trends illustrated in this table may not be indicative of future results.  Condensed Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2017 2016 2016 Revenue, net $ 3,470 100.0 % $ 3,035 100.0 % Cost of revenue 1,771 51.0 % 1,179 38.8 % Gross profit 1,699 49.0 % 1,856 61.2 % Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 1,136 32.7 % 1,547 51.0 % Research and development 306 8.8 % 323 10.6 % General and administrative 1,522 43.9 % 2,816 92.8 % Acquisition related amortization expense 813 23.4 % 970 32.0 % Change in fair value of contingent consideration (5,776 ) -166.5 % - - Total operating expenses (1,999 ) -57.6 % 5,656 186.4 % Operating income (loss) 3,698 106.6 % (3,800 ) -125.2 % Interest expense (254 ) -7.3 % (203 ) -6.7 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (1,547 ) -44.6 % - - Other income (expense), net (36 ) -1.0 % 6 0.2 % Income (loss) from continuing operations before tax 1,861 53.6 % (3,997 ) -131.7 % Provision for income tax 3 0.1 % 9 0.3 % Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,858 53.5 % (4,006 ) -132.0 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 556 16.0 % (780 ) -25.7 % Net income (loss) $ 2,414 69.6 % $ (4,786 ) -157.7 %  Revenue, net  Consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $0.5 million, or 14.3%, to $3.5 million, compared to $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was principally attributable to increased test and collection volume for our thyroid tests.  Cost of revenue  Consolidated cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $0.6 million or 50.2%. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in lab supplies expense for the period of $0.3 million and an increase in royalty expense of $0.1 million. As a percentage of revenue cost of revenue increased to 51.0% as compared to 38.8% in the comparable prior year period.  Gross profit  Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $0.2 million, or 8.5%, to $1.7 million, compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily related to the increase in lab supplies expense and royalty expense as discussed above.  Sales and marketing expense  Sales and marketing expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and as a percentage of revenue was 32.7%. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the sales and marketing expense was $1.5 million and 51.0% as a percentage of revenue. The decrease in sales and marketing expense principally reflects a reduction in sales personnel and the consolidation of marketing activities and the percentage of revenue decline is also a function of the growth in revenues.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  Research and development  Research and development expense reflects clinical and research costs for supplies, laboratory tests and evaluations, scientific and administrative staff involved in clinical research, statistical research and product development related to new tests, products and programs. These costs totaled $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and as a percentage of revenue were 8.8%. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 the expense was $0.3 million and as a percentage of revenue was 10.6%. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased revenues.  General and administrative  General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.5 million as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to reversal of severance accruals of $1.5 million partially offset by an increase in professional services expenses.  Acquisition related amortization expense  During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, we recorded amortization expense of approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. This relates to the amortization for RedPath and Asuragen acquired intangible assets. The decrease relates to the impact of certain intangibles being fully written off in 2016, as a result the amortization expense is reduced going forward.  Change in fair value of contingent consideration  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there was a $5.8 million reduction in contingent consideration liability related to amounts associated with future royalty payments for the assets acquired from Redpath. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.  Operating income (loss)  There was operating income from continuing operations of $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and an operating loss during the three months ended March 31, 2016 of $3.8 million. The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the reversal of our Redpath contingent consideration liability of $5.8 million. Without the reversal of contingent consideration the operating income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 would have been an operating loss of $2.1 million comparable to the $3.8 million operating loss in 2016.  Provision for income taxes  We had income tax expense of approximately $3,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We had income tax expense of approximately $9,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Income tax expense for both periods was primarily due to minimum state and local taxes.  Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  We had income from discontinued operations of $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a loss from discontinued operations of $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The income from discontinued operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was primarily related to a reversal of severance expense of $0.5 million. The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily related to the accrual of severance expense.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we had operating income of $3.7 million. As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 million and current liabilities of $13.0 million.  It is anticipated that we may require additional capital to fund our operations in the future. There is no guarantee that additional capital can be raised to fund our operations in 2017 and beyond. We intend to meet our capital needs by driving revenue growth, containing costs as well as exploring other options.  We completed four public offerings and a private placement of warrants from December 22, 2016 through February 8, 2017, which resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $14.1 million. See "Recent Equity Financings". Of that amount, we used approximately $1.3 million to make the first principal payment on the RedPath Note on December 31, 2016 (which RedPath Note has since been acquired by the Investor and exchanged with the Company for the Exchanged Notes) and approximately $1.0 million on February 27, 2017 to satisfy severance obligations due to five former senior executives. The proceeds from the public offerings and private placement have improved our overall cash position.  Additionally, on March 23, 2017, we completed the exchange of the RedPath Note, which was acquired by the Investor, for two new Exchanged Notes aggregating $8.9 million. The Exchanged Notes consisted of (i) a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $5.3 million which was convertible into shares of our common stock, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) a senior secured non-convertible note with an aggregate principal amount of $3.6 million. The Exchanged Notes ranked senior to all of our outstanding and future indebtedness, other than the indebtedness in favor of our credit line lender and were secured by a perfected security interest in all of our existing and future assets and those of our subsidiaries. Upon the reduction of 55% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Exchanged Notes, the Investor agreed to release its security interest in its entirety. On April 18, 2017, the institutional investor exchanged the $3.6 million secured note for a $3.6 million secured convertible note issued by the Company. On April 18, 2017, the investor fully converted the notes into shares of the Company's common stock. The security interest has been terminated and the liens will be released upon proper termination filings.  On September 28, 2016, the Company and its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, Interpace LLC and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation, entered into the Credit Agreement with SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Fund, L.P., or the Lender. Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lender agreed to provide a revolving loan, or the Loan, to us in the maximum principal amount of $1.2 million. The maturity date of the Loan is September 28, 2018. The Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 2.75%, payable in cash monthly in arrears. The interest rate will be increased by 5.0% in the event of a default under the Credit Agreement. We have not yet drawn down on the credit facility.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had not borrowed any funds under the Credit Agreement.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $4.1 million, of which $3.3 million was used in continuing operations and $0.8 million was used in discontinued operations. The main component of cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was a decrease in accrued payroll of $1.6 million and accrued liabilities of $0.7 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million, of which $1.8 million was used in continuing operations and $2.2 million was used in discontinued operations. The main component of cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was our loss from continuing operations of $4.0 million.  There was no net cash from investing activities for either period.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, there was net cash provided from financing activities of $10.7 million, which resulted from the issuance of common stock in our three direct offerings completed in the first quarter of 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, there was no cash from financing activities.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  Inflation  We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and whenever possible, seeking to insure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  None.  INTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS GROUP, INC.  May 12, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
