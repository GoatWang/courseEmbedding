	“Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on 28 January 2008. The Company is devoting substantially all of
	its present efforts to establish a new business and none of its planned principal operations have commenced. The primary operations
	of the Company will eventually be undertaken by PreAxia Canada.  PreAxia Canada is in the process of developing an online
	access system creating a health savings account that allows card payments and processing services to third-party administrators,
	insurance companies and others. PreAxia Canada Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta on January
	28, 2008. PreAxia Canada Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.


	 



	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies




	 





	Basis of Presentation




	 


	The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).


	 




	Reclassification




	 


	Certain prior period amounts in the condensed financial statements
	have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.



	 





	Unaudited Interim Financial Information





	 



	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
	statements of PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with Securities
	and Exchange Commission requirements for interim financial statements. Therefore, they do not include all of the information and
	footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. The consolidated
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the
	year ended May 31, 2016.


	 


	The interim consolidated financial information
	is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of November
	30, 2016, and the results of operations, and cash flows presented herein have been included in the consolidated financial statements.
	All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations
	for the full year.


	 




	Principles of Consolidation




	 


	The consolidated financial statements include
	the accounts of the Company and PreAxia Canada. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


	 




	Going Concern




	 


	These consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going
	concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal
	year.  Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these consolidated
	financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of
	assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  As of November 30, 2016, the
	Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, has accumulated losses of $3,815,573, has negative working capital of
	$1,664,935 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raises substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing
	to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  


	 








	 


	F-

	Management has no formal plan in place to
	address this concern but believes the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party
	advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid debt
	instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



	 





	Use of Estimates





	 



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property
	and equipment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Foreign Currency Translation




	 


	The functional currency of the Company is
	the United States dollar.  The functional currency of PreAxia Canada is the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities
	in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect
	at the balance sheet date and capital accounts are translated at historical rates.  Income statement accounts are translated
	at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing
	exchange rates from period to period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) account in stockholders’
	deficit.


	 


	Transactions undertaken in currencies other
	than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date.  Any
	exchange gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.


	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
	820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
	value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
	to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
	to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
	The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:






	 


	 




	 







	Level 1



	 



	Quoted market prices available in
	active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level 2



	 



	Pricing inputs other than quoted
	prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level 3



	 



	Pricing inputs that are
	generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.






	 








	 


	F-

	5



	 







	 




	 


	The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and
	liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
	The Company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of
	interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at November 30, 2016.


	 


	The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at
	fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis.


	 




	Gain (Loss) Per Share




	 


	Gain (loss) per share of common stock is computed
	by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.


	 




	Research and Development Costs




	 


	The Company accounts for software development costs in
	accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including FASB ASC 730, Research and Development, FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use
	Software, FASB 985-20, Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed and FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs


	.




	Costs incurred during the period of planning and design,
	prior to the period determining technological feasibility, for all software developed for use internal and external, has been
	charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs.  Additionally, costs incurred after determination
	of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development.


	The Company has capitalized certain costs in the development
	of our proprietary software (computer software to be sold, leased or licensed) for the period after technological feasibility
	was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales.


	Website development costs have been capitalized, under
	the same criteria as our marketed software.  


	Capitalized software costs are stated at cost.  The
	estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project. The software is being amortized over three
	years starting June 2014.




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company’s long-lived assets, which includes computer equipment is
	reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
	recoverable.


	 


	The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets
	by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets
	over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess
	of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.  Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected
	future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.  If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable,
	but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived
	assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.


	 


	The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived
	assets as of November 30, 2016.


	 








	 


	F-

	Commitments and Contingencies




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
	litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
	amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.



	 





	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and
	earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i)
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
	(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
	that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
	effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
	allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those
	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
	in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertain income tax positions.  Section 740-10-25 addresses
	the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
	statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
	likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits
	of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on
	the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
	740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
	periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized
	income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25.


	 




	Cash Flows Reporting




	 


	The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating,
	investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect
	method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from
	operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects
	of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts
	and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.  The
	Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time
	of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in
	the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing
	and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB
	Accounting Standards Codification.

	Subsequent Events




	 


	The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB
	Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through
	the date when the financial statements were issued.  Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,
	the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through
	filing them on EDGAR.

	General Overview



	 




	Corporate Overview




	Preaxia was incorporated in the State
	of Nevada on April 3, 2000. On December 11, 2008, the Nevada Secretary of State effected a name change which had been previously
	approved by the majority of the stockholders on October 28, 2008.


	Our company undertakes all of its operations
	through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (“PreAxia Canada”- formerly H Pay Card
	Inc). PreAxia Canada, prior to being acquired by PreAxia, was a private corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province
	of Alberta on January 28, 2008.



	General Overview



	PreAxia Canada is a company which intends
	to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market, specifically the opportunities
	tied to the growth of health spending accounts (“HSA”). There is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models
	to consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to
	deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market.


	Spawned by the need to address escalating
	health care costs, changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management
	of their health benefits, the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred.
	With the trend towards self-directed health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster, easier and more convenient benefit
	services, the insurance and benefits industries are banking on HSA medical payments being their next big growth conduit. Studies
	suggest that HSAs in the US will grow to over $75 billion in assets and 25 million consumers by 2017. This coupled with the continued
	growth of the Canadian group insurance industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services. We
	intend to initially launch our products in Canada. We believe that Canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing
	vehicle to control costs, increase profitability and get more return from their investment. We intend to provide them with services
	to capture this market opportunity.



	Description of Health Spending Account (“HSA”)



	An HSA can operate like a bank account;
	plan members start each plan year with a certain number of dollar credits in their HSA; throughout the year, those credits may
	be used to pay for certain medical, vision and dental expenses. The credits can be used to top up existing group coverage by covering
	residual amounts on prescription drugs, eyeglasses and hearing aids or to pay for medical, vision and dental expenses that otherwise
	may not be covered under the group benefit plan. Traditional health plan users pay premiums into a plan but do not see a return
	on money unless there is an issue with their health. In addition, most plans are established so that monies deposited into a plan
	by an employee are non-transferable upon the employee’s change of employment.


	Services and infrastructure provided
	by PreAxia will enable insurance companies, governments and corporations to replace cash and cheque payments. Our company’s
	plans are to provide instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund Pre-Paid Interac or credit card services
	to beneficiaries in real time. The beneficiary will select a personal identification number (“PIN”) using a PIN and
	card activation terminal, thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded.


	PreAxia is in the process of developing
	a platform for processing and managing accounts and payment cards, including cardholder and customer account management, reconciliation
	and financial settlement, and customer reporting.

	PreAxia is in the process of developing
	software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that will be fully managed
	by a data center. Products and services are anticipated to include:




	Payment card
	issuance on behalf of issuing bank partners for customer-branded credit cards and Interac payment cards. The cards are anticipated
	to be issued with Canadian and United States access through Interac (Canada) and STAR (United States) ATM, as well as inter-bank
	networks.




	Payment processing
	and funds allocation on payment accounts through financial electronic data interchange, wire transfers, and the automatic clearing
	house (“ACH”), with a PreAxia connection to a financial institution payment gateway and the United States ACH network
	through a United States financial institution.




	Enabling
	cardholders to select a personal PIN using a PreAxia PIN selection and card activation terminal. These functions enable the end
	user to be issued a PreAxia generated payment card at a customer’s office which is ready for immediate use.




	Authorizing
	transactions based upon the business requirements of PreAxia customers.




	Monitoring
	for unusual transaction activities, fraud and compliance violations.




	Providing
	management reports to customers and payment beneficiaries.




	Customer
	support center for reporting lost or stolen cards and for answering cardholder inquiries.





	Distribution Methods and Marketing
	Strategy



	PreAxia’s overall strategy is
	to finalize development of and market its health care payment cards and system. Our company will target enterprise-sized, public
	and private sector customers at the provincial and national levels. We will seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance
	partners to establish reference-able, high-profile implementations and market-leading, early-adopter firms for further developing
	innovative products and services. Our company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management, financial
	risk, audit management and cash management and target product/service management as a support to financial management.


	We anticipate that prime targets will
	be organizations that make a significant number of payments to individuals by way of cheques or serve individuals with limited
	or no access to bank accounts. We anticipate that PreAxia’s products will replace the usage of cheques for people who prefer
	electronic delivery of funds through a multi-functional Interac or major credit card and generate cost savings benefits and increased
	efficiencies for its clients.


	PreAxia intends to achieve service
	volume and the associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary
	transaction volumes, and through market specific channel partners. The channel strategy is supported in the solution design, as
	multiple channel partners will require branding and our company’s fee charging/collection capabilities.


	It is our company’s intention
	to sell through multi-tiered, value-added resellers. For example, the Health Card solution may be provided by a subcontract to
	a leading vendor that rebrands and adds value to the solution. The leading vendor in turn may form part of a larger professional
	services systems integration engagement with the customer. One example of this approach is that a major bank may lead on selling
	our company’s solution to medical insurance companies and the health care industry under our product brand.


	PreAxia has identified the following
	“channels” through which it will target prime end market customers:




	Benefits
	managers/adjudicators, including insurance, health or outsources government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement




	Issuer banks,
	including partner banks that enable the issuance of Health Cards




	Application
	providers, including software manufacturers selling into the target vertical markets




	Professional
	services, including consulting, development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets






	PreAxia intends to establish several
	key customer reference accounts, channel marketing partners and technology alliances. These corporate relationships are key to
	advance our company’s goals in 2017 for achieving a prime position in the Canadian public sector and establishing a solid
	service foundation.

	Competitive Business Conditions
	and our Company’s Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition



	PreAxia intends to offer a combination
	of products and services in its solution. However, there are other providers of components or versions of the Health Card value
	proposition in the marketplace. Our company is taking a different approach by providing a high value added and robust capability
	within specific target markets, rather than the “one size fits all” and mass volume approach of the larger companies
	in the Canadian and international market. The following are some of the leading providers of products and services that are or
	may be potential competitors in PreAxia’s target markets:



	Canadian Market:





	Pay Linx

	the Interac and MasterCard financial networks in North America. Pay Linx Financial Corporation was presently 27.0% owned by Royal
	Bank of Canada and provided services to Royal Bank of Canada for Canadian governments through

	QuickLinxTM,

	Intangible Properties



	 


	When negotiating its arrangements with clients, PreAxia intends
	to ensure that all rights to and ownership of its intellectual property remains with the company. We anticipate that source codes
	or other proprietary knowledge will be protected through agreements entered into between PreAxia and its employees and contractors,
	and additional high standards of confidentiality and protection of data are set by clients and regulatory authorities within the
	industry.


	 



	Intellectual Property and Patent Protection



	 


	At present, PreAxia has two trademarks pending. One is for the
	company name (PreAxia) and another is for the company logo design.


	 



	Plan of Operation



	 


	Over the next twelve months, we plan to:


	 




	 



	(a)




	 Raise additional capital to execute
	our business plans;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(b)




	 Penetrate the health care processing market in Canada,
	and worldwide, by continuing to develop innovative health care processing products and services;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(c)




	Build up a network of strategic alliances with several types
	of health insurance companies, governments and other alliances in various vertical markets; and





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(d)




	 Fill the positions of senior management sales, administrative
	and engineering positions.





	 



	Cash Requirements



	 


	After a further review of business opportunities with industry
	consultants, for the next twelve months and given that we meet our forecasted expenses, we plan to spend a total of approximately
	$1,550,000 in implementing our business plan of development and marketing of health care processing products and services.  We
	do not expect to generate any revenues this year, therefore we will be required to raise a total of $3,208,935 to complete our
	business plan and pay our outstanding debts of approximately $1,658,935.   Our working capital requirements for
	PreAxia Canada for the next twelve months are estimated at $1,550,000 distributed, as follows:

	Our estimated expenses over the next twelve months are broken down
	as follows:


	 




	 




	1.






	General and Administrative

	. We anticipate
	spending approximately $300,000 on general and administration costs in the next twelve months, which will include staff fees,
	office rent, office supplies, transfer agents, filing fees, bank service charges, salaries for our administration, interest
	expense and travel, which includes airfare, meals, car rentals and accommodations.

	Research and Development

	.  We anticipate that
	we may spend approximately $450,000 in the next twelve months in the development and acquisition of software for our
	processing services and products.

	.

	 

	We
	anticipate spending approximately $450,000 as the costs of staff and personnel, marketing and promoting our Company,
	our products and services, and educating the public to attract new accounts.





	 


	 


	 




	 




	4.






	Professional Services

	.  We anticipate that we
	may spend up to $350,000 in the next twelve months for professional services, which includes, accounting, auditing, legal
	fees and investor relations.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of November 30, 2016, PreAxia’s cash
	balance was $5,495 compared to $7,151 as at May 31, 2016.  Our Company will be required to raise capital to fund our
	operations.  PreAxia’s cash on hand is currently its only source of liquidity.  PreAxia had a working
	capital deficit of $1,664,935 as of November 30, 2016 compared with a working capital deficit of $1,665,249 as of May 31, 2016.  


	 


	Our ability to meet our financial liabilities
	and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders, and our ability to achieve and
	maintain profitable operations.  PreAxia's cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital
	requirements for the next twelve month period.   We will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities
	as we are in the development stage.   We project that we will require an estimated additional $3,220,000 over the
	next twelve month period to fund our operating cash shortfall and to complete our business plan.  Our company plans
	to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated
	funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of
	loans or such other means as PreAxia may determine.  


	 


	There are no assurances that we will be able
	to obtain funds required for our continued operations.  There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
	available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not
	able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due
	and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.


	 


	There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful and sufficient
	market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations.  The issuance of additional equity
	securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining
	commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.


	 


	Our working capital (deficit) as at November 30, 2016 compared
	to May 31, 2016 is summarized as follows:

	Our working capital deficit as of November 30, 2016 was comparable
	to the working capital deficit as of May 31, 2016.


	 



	Off-balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
	likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results
	of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

	Results of Operations





	 



	The following summary of our results of operations should be read
	in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	We have identified certain accounting policies, described below,
	that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations.


	 



	Revenue recognition



	 


	PreAxia recognizes revenue in accordance with the provision of
	the Securities and Exchange Commission which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
	recognition in financial statements.  This provision requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can
	be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the price
	to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.



	 




	Research and development



	 


	Software Development Costs


	The Company accounts for software development costs in
	accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including FASB ASC 730, Research and Development, FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use
	Software, FASB 985-20, Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed and FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs


	.




	Costs incurred during the period of planning and design,
	prior to the period determining technological feasibility, for all software developed for use internal and external, has been
	charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs.  Additionally, costs incurred after determination
	of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development.


	The Company has capitalized certain costs in the development
	of our proprietary software (computer software to be sold, leased or licensed) for the period after technological feasibility
	was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales.


	Website development costs have been capitalized, under
	the same criteria as our marketed software.  


	Capitalized software costs are stated at cost.  The
	estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project. The software is being amortized over three
	years starting June 2014.







	ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
	ABOUT MARKET RISK


	 


	Not applicable.



	 





	Item 4. Controls and
	Procedures.	



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 



	As required by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
	the period covered by this quarterly report, being November 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
	with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.


	 


	Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls
	or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well
	conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system are
	met. Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the benefits of a control system must be considered
	relative to its costs. These limitations also include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
	breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of
	some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control. The design of a control system is
	also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over time, currently implemented controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due
	to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be
	detected.


	 








	 



	14



	 







	 




	 


	Based upon their evaluation, our principal executive officer and
	principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as at the end of the period
	covered by this quarterly report.


	Our company determined that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective as of November 30, 2016 due to the following two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
	reporting that we indentified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016: (i) we do not have accounting
	staff with sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for U.S. income taxes and complex US GAAP matters;
	and (ii) we failed to file our corporate tax returns for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 or 2015. As we disclosed in
	our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make
	the necessary improvements to remediate these material weaknesses. In particular, we intend to hire staff with U.S. GAAP expertise
	if we can obtain additional financing and hire professionals to prepare and complete the filing of our corporate tax returns.



	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
	reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
	to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

	Risks Associated with our Financial Condition




	 





	Our independent auditors have expressed
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 


	We incurred a net loss of $3,815,573 for the period from April
	3, 2000 (date of inception) to November 30, 2016. We are yet to attain profitable operations. In their report on our financial
	statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


	 








	 



	15



	 







	 




	 


	Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
	our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and
	repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. We have not generated significant revenues
	since our inception on January 28, 2008. We will, in all likelihood, continue to incur operating expenses without significant
	revenues for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate enough interest in our health payment
	market products. If we cannot attract a significant customer base, we will not be able to generate any significant revenues
	or income. In addition, if we are unable to establish and generate significant revenues, or obtain adequate future financing,
	our business will fail and you may lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.



	 





	We have additional financing requirements.




	 


	In order to accelerate PreAxia's growth objectives, we will need
	to raise additional funds from lenders and equity markets in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise
	additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to finance our growth objectives. The ability of PreAxia to arrange such financing
	in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions as well as the business performance of PreAxia.
	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us.
	If additional financing is raised by the issuance of shares of common stock of PreAxia, control of PreAxia may change and stockholders
	may suffer additional dilution of their ownership interest in PreAxia.


	 




	We have negative cash flow and absence
	of profits.




	 


	PreAxia has not earned any profits to date and there is no assurance
	that it will earn any profits in the future, or that profitability, if achieved, will be sustained. A significant portion of our
	financial resources will continue to be directed to the development of our products and to marketing activities. Our success will
	ultimately depend on our ability to generate revenues from our product sales, such that the business development and marketing
	activities may be financed by revenues from operations instead of external financing.


	 


	There is no assurance that future revenues will be sufficient to
	generate the required funds to continue such business development and marketing activities.




	 





	Risks Associated with our Business





	 






	We have a limited operating history.




	 


	We are in the early stages of development and face risks associated
	with a new company in a growth industry. We may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement
	our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations
	and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment. Even if we accomplish
	these objectives, we may not generate positive cash flows or the profits we anticipate in the future.


	 


	We have a limited operational history. We are in the early commercialization
	stage of our business and therefore we will be subject to the risks associated with early stage companies, including uncertainty
	of revenues, markets and profitability and the need to raise additional funding. We will be committing, and for the foreseeable
	future will continue to commit, significant financial resources to marketing, product development and research. Our business and
	prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early
	stage of development. Such risks include the evolving and unpredictable nature of our business, our ability to anticipate and
	adapt to a developing market, acceptance by consumers of our products and the ability to identify, attract and retain qualified
	personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing what is necessary to address these risks.




	 






	We will require key personnel.




	 



	The financial
	services technology industry, and HSA marketplace, involves a high degree of risk

	,

	which
	even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our success is dependent on the
	services of our senior management. The loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations
	and business prospects. In addition, our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional
	highly skilled technical, management, sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful
	in attracting and retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
	results and financial condition.




	 







	 



	16



	 







	 




	 




	We may not be successful in the protection
	of our intellectual property.




	 


	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims
	(or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such
	assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Irrespective
	of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect
	to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
	Our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance
	that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will
	be enforceable. The laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. We may
	in the future also rely on technology licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that these third party licenses will
	be, or will continue to be, available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The loss of, or inability of PreAxia to maintain,
	any of these technology licenses could result in delays in completing its product enhancements and new developments until equivalent
	technology could be identified, licensed, or developed and integrated. Any such delays would materially adversely affect our business,
	results of operations and financial condition.


	 




	We face competition and may not be able
	to compete successfully.




	 


	PreAxia may not be able to compete successfully against current
	and future competitors, and the competitive pressures PreAxia faces could harm its business and prospects. Broadly speaking, the
	market for HSAs and for financial services technology is competitive. There are other providers of components or versions of both
	HSAs and the Health Card value proposition in the marketplace. Additionally, the level of competition is likely to increase as
	current competitors improve their product offerings and as new participants enter these markets. Many of PreAxia’s current
	and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater name and brand recognition and significantly
	greater financial, sales, marketing, technical and other resources than PreAxia.


	 


	Additionally, these competitors have research and development capabilities
	that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with products our company markets and distributes. New
	technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may also increase competitive pressures on PreAxia. Increased competition
	may result in reduced operating margins as well as loss of market share. This could result in decreased usage of our products
	and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	We may face implementation delays.




	 


	Most of our customers will be in a testing or preliminary stage
	of utilizing our products and may encounter delays or other problems in the introduction of our products. A decision not to do
	so, or a delay in implementation, could result in a delay or loss of related revenue or could otherwise harm our business and
	prospects. PreAxia will not be able to predict when a customer that is in a testing or a preliminary use phase will adopt a broader
	use of our products.


	 




	We may get limited customer feedback
	respecting products.




	 


	Our revenue will depend on the number of customers who use
	our products. Accordingly, the satisfactory design of our product is critical to our business, and any significant product
	design limitations or deficiencies could harm our business and market acceptance. The feedback we obtain from our customers
	is critical to our ability to fix any limitations or deficiencies in our product. If we do not obtain adequate feedback from
	our customers, we may not be able to adequately assess our customers’ requirements. The currently specified features
	and functionality of our product may not satisfy current or future customer demands. Furthermore, even if we identify the
	feature set required by our customers and potential customers, we may not be able to design and implement products
	incorporating features in a timely and efficient manner, if at all.


	 








	 



	17



	 







	 




	 




	We may face a slow down in developing
	markets.




	 


	The market for our products is relatively new and continues to
	evolve. If the market for our product fails to develop and grow, or if our product does not gain market acceptance, our business
	and prospects will be harmed.


	 




	Our ability to keep current with technological
	changes can impact our ongoing business.




	 


	The HSA and financial services technology industries are susceptible
	to technological advances and the introduction of new products utilizing new technologies. Further, the HSA and financial services
	technology industries are also subject to customer preferences and to competitive pressures which can, among other things, necessitate
	revisions in pricing strategies, price reductions and reduced profit margins. The success of PreAxia will depend on our ability
	to secure technological superiority in our products and maintain such superiority in the face of new products from competitors.
	No assurances can be given that our products will be commercially viable or that further modification or additional products will
	not be required in order to meet demands or to make changes necessitated by developments made by competitors which might render
	our products less competitive, less marketable, or even obsolete over time. The future success of PreAxia will be influenced by
	our ability to continue to develop new competitive products. There can be no assurance that research and development activities
	with respect to the development of new products and the improvement of our existing products will prove profitable, or that products
	or improvements resulting therefrom, if any, will be successfully produced and marketed.


	 


	The HSA and financial services technology industries are characterized
	by technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, new product introductions, new technologies, and the emergence
	of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology obsolete or have a negative impact on sales margins our
	product may command. PreAxia's performance will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our existing product, develop new proprietary
	technology that addresses the sophisticated and varied needs of its prospective customers, and respond to technological advances
	and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of technology entails significant
	technical and business risks. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting
	our product to customer requirements or emerging industry standards.


	 




	We require strategic alliances.




	 


	Our growth and marketing strategies are based, in part, on seeking
	out and forming strategic alliances and working relationships, as well as the performance of such strategic alliances and working
	relationships. General criteria to be used to assess potential alliances include the following: industry expertise, reputation
	and market position, complementary technologies or products, and nature and adequacy of resources.


	 




	We may have problems with our resolution
	of product deficiencies.




	 


	Difficulties in product design, performance and reliability could
	result in lost revenue, delays in customer acceptance of PreAxia’s products, and/or lawsuits, and would be detrimental,
	perhaps materially, to our market reputation. Serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following the
	introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. Undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered
	in the future. Moreover, known errors which we consider minor may be considered serious by our customers. If our internal quality
	assurance testing or customer testing reveals performance issues and/or desirable feature enhancements, we may postpone the development
	and release of updates or enhancements to our current product or the release of new products. We may not be able to successfully
	complete the development of planned or future products in a timely manner, or to adequately address product defects, which could
	harm our business and prospects. In addition, product defects may expose us to liability claims, for which we may not have sufficient
	liability insurance. A successful suit against us could harm our business and financial condition.


	 






	 



	18



	 







	 






	We may not be able to effectively manage
	our growth.




	 


	We may be subject to growth-related risks, including capacity constraints
	and pressure on our internal systems and controls. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to
	implement and improve our operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base. The inability of
	PreAxia to deal with this growth could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and prospects. We may experience
	growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operating and financial systems, resulting in increased responsibilities
	for our personnel, the hiring of additional personnel and, in general, higher levels of operating expenses. In order to manage
	our current operations and any future growth effectively, we will also need to continue to implement and improve our operational,
	financial and management information systems and to hire, train, motivate, manage and retain our employees. There can be no assurance
	that we will be able to manage such growth effectively, that our management, personnel or systems will be adequate to support
	our operations or that we will be able to achieve the increased levels of revenue proportional with the increased levels of operating
	expenses associated with this growth.


	 




	Our directors and officers may face
	conflicts of interest.




	 


	Certain directors and officers of PreAxia may become associated
	with other reporting issuers or other corporations which may give rise to conflicts of interest. Directors who have a material
	interest or any person who is a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with PreAxia is required, subject
	to certain exceptions, to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the contract.
	In addition, our directors are required to act honestly, and in good faith, with a view to the best interests of PreAxia, as the
	case may be. Certain of the directors may have, other employment, other business, or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly,
	these directors will only be able to devote part of their time to the affairs of PreAxia.


	 


	Certain directors and officers may have other employment, other
	business, or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly, these directors will only be able to devote part of their time
	to the affairs of PreAxia.


	 




	We do not have key personnel insurance.




	 


	We do not currently have key personnel insurance in place in respect
	of any of our senior officers or personnel.


	 




	Acquisitions, investments and other
	strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our investors and other negative consequences.




	 


	It is our current intention to engage in and evaluate a wide array
	of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets.
	As of the date of filing of this quarterly report, we have not yet identified any such strategic transactions. Any of these strategic
	transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. In our search for opportunities to engage
	in strategic transactions, we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential
	acquisitions or investments, or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase
	our earnings. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company or business, or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual
	property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen
	operating difficulties and expenditures.


	 


	Additional risks we may face include:


	 







	·




	the
	need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public
	company in an acquired company that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls,
	procedures and policies;










	·




	cultural
	challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business
	into our organization;










	·




	retaining
	key employees from the businesses we acquire, and










	·




	the
	need to integrate an acquired company’s accounting, management information, human
	resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management.





	 






	 



	19



	 







	 




	Future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance
	of our equity securities, potentially diluting the ownership interest in our company of our existing stockholders, the incurrence
	of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired in-process technology,
	or other increased expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to
	review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments.


	 




	Fluctuations in quarterly operating
	results lead to unpredictability of revenue and earnings.




	 


	The timing of the release of health care payments processing products
	and services can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations. A significant portion of revenue in any quarter may
	be derived from sales of products and services introduced in that quarter or established in the immediately preceding quarter.
	If we are unable to begin to generate sales of products and services during the scheduled quarter, our revenue and earnings will
	be negatively affected in that period. Quarterly operating results also may be materially impacted by factors, including the level
	of market acceptance, or demand for health payment processing products and services and the level of development and/or promotion
	expenses for health payment processing products and services. Consequently, if net revenue in a period is below expectations,
	our operating results and financial position in that period are likely to be negatively affected, as has occurred in the past.


	 




	Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
	over financial reporting were not effective, which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
	being disseminated to the public.




	 


	Our management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures
	as of November 30, 2016 and concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. In addition,
	our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 and concluded that that there were material
	weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date and that our internal control over financial reporting
	was not effective as of that date. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that
	there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on
	a timely basis.


	 


	We have not yet remediated this material weakness and we believe
	that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting continue to be ineffective. Until these
	issues are corrected, our ability to report financial results or other information required to be disclosed on a timely and accurate
	basis may be adversely affected and our financial reporting may continue to be unreliable, which could result in additional misinformation
	being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.


	 



	Risks Associated with Our Common Stock





	 






	Our common stock is traded on the "Over-the-Counter
	Bulletin Board," which may make it more difficult for investors to resell their shares due to suitability requirements.




	 


	Our common stock is currently quoted for trading on Over the Counter
	Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”) under the symbol PAXH.OB where we expect it to remain in the foreseeable future. Broker-dealers
	often decline to trade in OTCBB stocks given the market for such securities is often limited, the stocks are more volatile, and
	the risk to investors is greater. These factors may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of
	potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise
	dispose of their shares. This could cause our stock price to decline.


	 




	Because we can issue additional shares
	of our common stock or preferred stock, purchasers of our common stock may experience dilution in their ownership of our company
	in the future.




	 


	We are authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock.
	As of January 10, 2017, there were 18,426,332 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Our board of directors has the
	authority to cause our company to issue additional shares of common stock without the consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently,
	our stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership of our company in the future.






	 



	20



	 







	 




	 




	We do not intend to pay any dividends
	on our common stock in the foreseeable future.






	 




	We do not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to
	our stockholders in the foreseeable future. It is our current intention to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future
	to increasing our working capital. We currently have no material revenues and a history of losses, so there can be no assurance
	that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock, and in any
	event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which currently do not intend
	to pay any dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future.


	 




	Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted
	by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy
	and sell our stock.






	 




	Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities
	and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that
	has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
	exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
	who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor”
	refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
	annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to
	a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form
	prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks
	in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny
	stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the
	market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and
	salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and
	must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules
	require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special
	written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written
	agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the
	secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the
	ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit
	the marketability of our common stock.


	 




	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
	sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.




	 


	In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above,
	the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) has adopted rules that require that when recommending an investment
	to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior
	to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts
	to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under
	interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not
	be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their
	customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the
	market for shares of our common stock.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.



	This annual report contains forward-looking
	statements. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial performance. In some
	cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “intend”,
	“expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”,
	“potential”, or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements
	are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors”
	commencing on page 5, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity
	or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these
	forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: a continued downturn in international economic conditions; any
	adverse occurrence with respect to the development or marketing of our product; any adverse occurrence with respect to any of our
	licensing agreements; our ability to successfully bring products to market; product development or other initiatives by our competitors;
	fluctuations in the availability and cost of materials required to produce our products; any adverse occurrence with respect to
	distribution of our products; potential negative financial impact from claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings or challenges;
	and other factors beyond our control.


	Although we believe that the
	expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity
	or performance. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update
	any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	As used in this annual report,
	the terms “we”, “us” “our” the “Corporation” and “PreAxia” mean PreAxia
	Health Care Payment Systems Inc. and our wholly- owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment System Inc. (formerly H Pay Card
	Inc.), unless the context clearly requires otherwise. Unless otherwise stated, “$” refers to United States dollars.





	ITEM 1. BUSINESS





	Corporate Overview




	Preaxia was incorporated in the
	State of Nevada on April 3, 2000. On December 11, 2008, the Nevada Secretary of State effected a name change which had been previously
	approved by the majority of the stockholders on October 28, 2008.


	Our company undertakes all of
	its operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (“PreAxia Canada”- formerly
	H Pay Card Inc). PreAxia Canada, prior to being acquired by PreAxia, was a private corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws
	of the Province of Alberta on January 28, 2008.

	General Overview





	PreAxia
	Canada is a company which intends to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment
	market, specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of health spending accounts (“HSA”). There is a rapid shift
	in healthcare traditional payment models to consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial
	services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market.


	Spawned by the need to address
	escalating health care costs, changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in
	the management of their health benefits, the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming
	increasingly blurred. With the trend towards self-directed health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster, easier and
	more convenient benefit services, the insurance and benefits industries are banking on HSA medical payments being their next big
	growth conduit. Studies suggest that HSAs in the US reached $30 billion in assets and 16.7 million consumers in 2015, an increase
	of more than 20% over the prior year. This coupled with the continued growth of the Canadian group insurance industry illustrates
	the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services. We intend to initially launch our products in Canada. We believe
	that Canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing vehicle to control costs, increase profitability and get more
	return from their investment. We intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity.



	Description of Health Spending Account (“HSA”)



	An HSA is a uniquely designed bank account established exclusively
	and specifically for the purpose of health care spending. An employer deposits funds into a special account for the employee. These
	funds can be used to pay for eligible medical and related health care expenses for the employee and their dependents. HSAs provide
	employers and employees with greater control in both the amount of funds invested and how these funds are used.


	 


	Services and infrastructure provided by PreAxia enable organizations
	and individuals to eliminate all paper involved in the management of these accounts and benefit through savings in time and money.


	 


	The PreAxia platform for processing and managing accounts,
	including cardholder and customer account management, reconciliation and financial settlement, and customer reporting is fully
	operational.


	 


	Over time, the company will evaluate opportunities for forms
	of virtual banking and PayPal-type services. One opportunity seen as particularly relevant to the health care market is to offer
	instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund Pre-Paid Interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in
	real time. If implemented, the beneficiary will most likely select a personal identification number (“PIN”) using a
	PIN and card activation terminal, thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded. This consideration would require development
	of software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that would be fully managed
	by a data center.


	Matching of consumers in need of health care products
	or services with providers is another area PreAxia intends to evaluate. Consumers managing their health care dollars through an
	online system will find convenience in seeking out health care professionals and services through the same system

	.




	Distribution Methods and Marketing
	Strategy



	PreAxia operates on a Cloud Computing Platform that
	makes it accessible to anyone with a personal computer and Internet access. The preliminary market for PreAxia’s HSA Management
	Solution is small and medium sized companies that are not currently well served by the current group benefits model. The financial
	benefits of the PreAxia business model, however, are also relevant to larger employers and we believe that these larger employers
	will migrate to the PreAxia product over time.

	PreAxia’s s marketing strategy is to promote
	its existing platform direct to consumers and businesses, and to the groups that most need access to it. Specifically, independent
	brokers, financial advisors and small to medium sized businesses need access. Brokers should see PreAxia as a superior method of
	promoting and supporting HSAs that allow them to earn above average commission rates on invested funds. Financial advisors should
	see PreAxia in a similar way as brokers except that there is the additional benefit of tax reduction. Small to medium sized businesses,
	which are expected to drive the growth in business, should see PreAxia as offering financial savings to the company and to employees
	by offering personal health care benefits through an HSA, along with the same conveniences they have come to expect from other
	services they currently utilize over the Internet. It is expected that the group benefits market will subsequently follow as they
	too realize the advantages of PreAxia over their current HSA offerings. PreAxia has begun and will continue to seek opportunities
	with lead customers and alliance partners to establish reference-able, high-profile implementations and market-leading, early-adopter
	firms for further developing innovative products and services. The company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate
	financial management, financial risk, audit management and cash management while targeting product/service management as a support
	to financial management.


	We anticipate that the prime target for services will
	be small to medium sized organizations that are not adequately served by the current insurance and group benefits offerings. These
	organizations should realize significant benefits in both cost and time savings by utilization of PreAxia technology while providing
	their employees with an increased level of benefits.


	PreAxia intends to achieve service volume and the
	associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary transaction volumes,
	through market specific channel partners and through an education based public relations strategy geared to the small to mid-sized
	employers including the brokers and financial advisors utilized by these businesses. The channel strategy is supported in the solution
	design, as multiple channel partners will require branding and our company’s fee charging/collection capabilities.


	It is our company’s intention that brokers and
	financial advisors will aggressively promote their PreAxia supported HSA offerings due to the quality of product, higher margins
	and because of the non-competitive relationship with PreAxia.


	PreAxia has identified the following “channels”
	through which it will target prime end market customers:


	Independent brokers that sell, or desire to
	sell, Health Spending Accounts


	Financial advisors who manage funds and advise
	on tax saving strategies for individuals and corporations


	Managing General Agents that provide services
	and education to the broker community


	Accountants and bookkeepers who regularly advise
	businesses on financial and operational matters


	Benefits managers/adjudicators, including insurance,
	health or outsourced government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement


	Issuer banks, including partner banks that enable
	the issuance of Health Cards and/or sell insurance products


	Application providers, including software manufacturers
	selling into the target vertical markets


	Professional services, including consulting,
	development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets

	PreAxia intends to establish several key customer
	reference accounts, channel marketing partners and technology alliances. These corporate relationships are relevant to advancing
	our company’s goals in


	2016 and beyond for achieving a prime position in the Canadian marketplace
	and establishing a solid service foundation.



	Competitive Business Conditions
	and our Company’s Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition



	PreAxia intends to offer a combination
	of products and services in its solution. However, there are other providers of components or versions of the Health Card value
	proposition in the marketplace. Our company is taking a different approach by providing a high value added and robust capability
	within specific target markets, rather than the “one size fits all” and mass volume approach of the larger companies
	in the Canadian and international market. The following are some of the leading providers of products and services that are or
	may be potential competitors in PreAxia’s target markets:



	Canadian Market:




	Pay Linx Financial Corporation is presently
	inactive, but was a company offering prepaid debit card payment solutions that integrated into the Interac and MasterCard financial
	networks in North America. Pay Linx Financial Corporation was presently 27.0% owned by Royal Bank of Canada and provided services
	to Royal Bank of Canada for Canadian governments through

	QuickLinxTM,

	replacing cheque and voucher payments.


	DirectCash Income Fund offers prepaid
	debit and credit cards and processes cash card transactions. In addition, DirectCash Income Fund provides ATM and debit terminal
	transaction processing, sales and maintenance.


	CardOne Plus Ltd. offers prepaid debit
	card products designed to support merchant specific programs, including card graphics and merchant account management. These products
	are certified for acceptance on multiple card scheme and ATM networks.


	HyperWALLET Systems Inc. offers a product
	offering “flexible debit card payment solutions” through Alterna Savings, HSBC and the Credit Union Central of British
	Columbia, Canada. It also offers pre- authorized debit, credit card, EFT and bill payment services.


	NextWave Wireless Inc. is a joint venture
	between Money Mart and DataWave Systems Inc., established to provide card issuance solutions including prepaid debit and credit
	cards. ”Nextwave Titanium” prepaid cards issued by Money Mart support loading from Money Mart transactions, such as
	cheque cashing, bill payment and ATM cash withdrawal.


	DataWave Systems Inc. provides prepaid
	card products for scheme cards as well as prepaid phone cards and prepaid wireless airtime. It offers “instant activation”
	through retail point of sale (“POS”) terminals. DataWave Systems Inc. is owned by InComm, a global provider of prepaid
	services. DataWave Systems Inc. also powers the Peoples Trust Company’s card service initiative, “HorizonPlus”,
	which is the contracted provider of “Titanium” card services.







	 



	7



	 







	 




	 



	International Market:




	Orbiscom Inc. is in an alliance with
	MasterCard to offer “custom use cards” that can be issued by MasterCard banks and provides for restricted authorizations
	(by merchant, merchant type or geography) as well as instant issuance.


	Comdata Corporation offers “controlled
	spending solutions”, with enhanced authorization and “real time” transfer of funds to payees, including government
	program payments.


	Affiliated Computer Services Inc. (ACS)
	is penetrating the U.S. government benefits card issuance marketplace through MasterCard prepaid cards that support “no fee”
	ATM cash withdrawals through participating ATM networks. ACS provides these services for a range of governmental benefits programs.


	Metavante Corporation is owned by Marshall
	& Ilsley Corporation and provides a wide range of payments products and services.


	Blackhawk Network is owned by Safeway
	and is a provider of the “gift card mall”, which can be used at participating merchants only. These cards are Visa,
	MasterCard or American Express branded and are activated at the POS.


	InComm is expanding its prepaid card
	services network “Fastcard” through an arrangement with Green Dot Corporation, which is a leading network of reloadable
	debit cards and processes for the MasterCard “repower” POS-based load network for prepaid cards.




	Intangible Properties



	When negotiating its arrangements
	with clients, PreAxia intends to ensure that all rights to and ownership of its intellectual property remains with our company.
	We anticipate that source codes or other proprietary knowledge will be protected through agreements entered into between PreAxia
	and its employees and contractors, and additional high standards of confidentiality and protection of data are set by clients and
	regulatory authorities within the industry.



	Intellectual Property and
	Patent Protection



	At present, PreAxia does not
	have any pending or registered patents or any trademarks.



	Research and Development



	For the years ended May 31, 2016,
	and 2015, we expended $31,643 and $0 on research and development.



	Employees



	PreAxia has one full-time consultant,
	our President, Mr. Tom Zapatinas effective September 1, 2011. We anticipate that we will hire additional key staff throughout 2016/17
	in areas of administration/accounting, business development, operations, sales/marketing, and research/development.






	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS





	Risks Related to our Company





	We have a limited operating
	history.







	 



	8



	 







	 




	We are in the early stages of
	development and face risks associated with a new company in a growth industry. We may not successfully address these risks and
	uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to
	the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire
	investment. Even if we accomplish these objectives, we may not generate positive cash flows or the profits we anticipate in the
	future.


	PreAxia has a limited operational
	history. Our company has never paid dividends and has no present intention to pay dividends. Our company is in the early commercialization
	stage of its business and therefore will be subject to the risks associated with early stage companies, including uncertainty of
	revenues, markets and profitability and the need to raise additional funding. PreAxia will be committing, and for the foreseeable
	future will continue to commit, significant financial resources to marketing, product development and research. PreAxia’s
	business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
	in the early stage of development. Such risks include the evolving and unpredictable nature of our company’s business, PreAxia’s
	ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market, acceptance by consumers of our products and the ability to identify, attract
	and retain qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that PreAxia will be successful in doing what is necessary to address
	these risks.



	We will need substantial additional
	financing in the future to continue operations.



	Our ability to continue our present
	operations will be dependent upon our ability to obtain significant external funding. Additional sources of funding have not been
	established. We are exploring various financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing
	such financing at acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available from the foregoing sources, or if we determine
	it is to otherwise be in our best interests, we may consider additional strategic financing options, including sales of assets.



	We will require key personnel.



	The financial services technology
	industry involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able
	to overcome. The success of PreAxia is dependent on the services of its senior management. The experience of these individuals
	will be a factor contributing to our company’s continued success and growth. The loss of one or more of its key employees
	could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business prospects. In addition, PreAxia’s future success will
	depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical, management, sales and marketing
	personnel. There can be no assurance that our company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel and the failure
	to do so could have a material adverse effect on our company’s business, operating results and financial condition.



	We have additional financing
	requirements.



	In order to accelerate PreAxia’s
	growth objectives, it will need to raise additional funds from lenders and equity markets in the future. There can be no assurance
	that our company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to finance its growth objectives. The
	ability of our company to arrange such financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions
	as well as the business performance of our company. There can be no assurance that PreAxia will be successful in its efforts to
	arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to our company. If additional financing is raised by the issuance of shares
	of common stock of our company, control of our company may change and stockholders may suffer additional dilution.



	We may not be successful in the protection of intellectual
	property.



	There can be no assurance
	that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be
	asserted or prosecuted against PreAxia or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our
	company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Irrespective of the validity or the successful
	assertion of such claims, our company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense
	thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our company’s business, financial condition or results of
	operations. Our company’s performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary
	technology. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by our company will prevent misappropriation of its technology or
	that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. The laws of other countries may afford our company little
	or no effective protection of its intellectual property. Our company may in the future also rely on technology licenses from
	third parties. There can be no assurance that these third party licenses will be, or will continue to be, available to our
	company on commercially reasonable terms. The loss of, or inability of our company to maintain, any of these technology
	licenses could result in delays in completing its product enhancements and new developments until equivalent technology could
	be identified, licensed, or developed and integrated. Any such delays would materially adversely affect PreAxia’s
	business, results of operations and financial condition.

	Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
	control over financial reporting are not effective, which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
	being disseminated to the public.



	Our management evaluated our
	disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2016 and concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective. In addition, our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 and
	concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date and that our internal
	control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination
	of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will
	not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


	We have not yet remediated these
	material weaknesses and we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting continue
	to be ineffective. Until these issues are corrected, our ability to report financial results or other information required to be
	disclosed on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected and our financial reporting may continue to be unreliable, which
	could result in additional misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make
	an uninformed investment decision.




	Risks Related to our Business





	We face competition and may not be able to compete
	successfully.



	PreAxia may not be able to compete
	successfully against current and future competitors, and the competitive pressures PreAxia faces could harm its business and prospects.
	Broadly speaking, the market for financial services technology is competitive. There are other providers of components or versions
	of the Health Card value proposition in the marketplace. Additionally, the level of competition is likely to increase as current
	competitors improve their product offerings and as new participants enter the market. Many of PreAxia’s current and potential
	competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater name and brand recognition and significantly greater
	financial, sales, marketing, technical and other resources than PreAxia.


	Additionally, these competitors
	have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with products
	PreAxia markets and distributes. New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may also increase competitive pressures
	on PreAxia. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins as well as loss of market share. This could result in
	decreased usage of PreAxia’s products and may have a material adverse effect on PreAxia’s business, financial condition
	and results of operations.



	We may face implementation
	delays.







	 



	10



	 







	 




	Most of PreAxia’s customers
	will be in a testing or preliminary stage of utilizing PreAxia’s products and may encounter delays or other problems in the
	introduction of PreAxia’s products. A decision not to do so, or a delay in implementation, could result in a delay or loss
	of related revenue or could otherwise harm PreAxia’s businesses and prospects. PreAxia will not be able to predict when a
	customer that is in a testing or a preliminary use phase will adopt a broader use of PreAxia’s products.



	We may get limited customer
	feedback respecting products.



	PreAxia’s revenue will
	depend on the number of customers who use PreAxia’s products. Accordingly, the satisfactory design of PreAxia’s product
	is critical to PreAxia’s business, and any significant product design limitations or deficiencies could harm PreAxia’s
	business and market acceptance. This limited feedback may not have resulted in an adequate assessment of customer requirements.
	Therefore, the currently specified features and functionality of PreAxia’s product may not satisfy current or future customer
	demands. Furthermore, even if PreAxia identifies the feature set required by customers in PreAxia’s market, it may not be
	able to design and implement products incorporating features in a timely and efficient manner, if at all.



	We may face a slowdown in
	developing markets.



	The market for PreAxia’s
	product is relatively new and continues to evolve. If the market for PreAxia’s product fails to develop and grow, or if PreAxia’s
	product does not gain market acceptance, PreAxia’s business and prospects will be harmed.



	Our ability to keep current
	with technological changes will impact our ongoing business.



	The financial services technology
	industry is susceptible to technological advances and the introduction of new products utilizing new technologies. Further, the
	financial services technology industry is also subject to customer preferences and to competitive pressures which can, among other
	things, necessitate revisions in pricing strategies, price reductions and reduced profit margins. The success of PreAxia will depend
	on its ability to secure technological superiority in its product and maintain such superiority in the face of new products. No
	assurances can be given that the product of PreAxia will be commercially viable or that further modification or additional products
	will not be required in order to meet demands or to make changes necessitated by developments made by competitors which might render
	the product of PreAxia less competitive, less marketable, or even obsolete over time. The future success of PreAxia will be influenced
	by its ability to continue to develop new competitive products. There can be no assurance that research and development activities
	with respect to the development of new products and the improvement of its existing product will prove profitable, or that products
	or improvements resulting therefrom, if any, will be successfully produced and marketed.


	The financial services technology
	industry is characterized by technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, new product introductions, new technologies,
	and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render PreAxia’s technology obsolete or have a negative
	impact on sales margins PreAxia’s product may command. PreAxia’s performance will depend, in part, on its ability to
	enhance its existing product, develop new proprietary technology that addresses the sophisticated and varied needs of its prospective
	customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.
	The development of technology entails significant technical and business risks. There can be no assurance that PreAxia will be
	successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its product to customer requirements or emerging industry standards.



	We require strategic alliances.



	PreAxia’s growth and marketing
	strategies are based, in part, on seeking out and forming strategic alliances and working relationships, as well as the performance
	of such strategic alliances and working relationships. General criteria to be used to assess potential alliances include the following:
	industry expertise, reputation and market position, complementary technologies or products, and nature and adequacy of resources.






	 



	11



	 







	 





	We may have problems with
	our resolution of product deficiencies.



	Difficulties in product design,
	performance and reliability could result in lost revenue, delays in customer acceptance of PreAxias’s products, and/or lawsuits,
	and would be detrimental, perhaps materially, to PreAxia’s market reputation. Serious defects are frequently found during
	the period immediately following the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. Undetected errors or performance
	problems may be discovered in the future. Moreover, known errors which PreAxia considers minor may be considered serious by its
	customers. If PreAxia’s internal quality assurance testing or customer testing reveals performance issues and/or desirable
	feature enhancements, PreAxia could postpone the development and release of updates or enhancements to its current product or the
	release of new products. PreAxia may not be able to successfully complete the development of planned or future products in a timely
	manner, or to adequately address product defects, which could harm PreAxia’s business and prospects. In addition, product
	defects may expose PreAxia to liability claims, for which PreAxia may not have sufficient liability insurance. A successful lawsuit
	against PreAxia could harm its business and financial condition.



	We may not be able to effectively
	manage our growth.



	PreAxia may be subject to growth-related
	risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls. PreAxia’s ability to manage its
	growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand, train
	and manage its employee base. The inability of PreAxia to deal with this growth could have a material adverse impact on its business,
	operations and prospects. PreAxia may experience growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operating and financial
	systems, resulting in increased responsibilities for PreAxia’s personnel, the hiring of additional personnel and, in general,
	higher levels of operating expenses. In order to manage its current operations and any future growth effectively, PreAxia will
	also need to continue to implement and improve its operational, financial and management information systems and to hire, train,
	motivate, manage and retain its employees. There can be no assurance that PreAxia will be able to manage such growth effectively,
	that its management, personnel or systems will be adequate to support PreAxia’s operations or that PreAxia will be able to
	achieve the increased levels of revenue commensurate with the increased levels of operating expenses associated with this growth.






	 



	12



	 







	 





	 




	We have negative cash flow and absence of profits.



	PreAxia has not earned any profits
	to date and there is no assurance that it will earn any profits in the future, or that profitability, if achieved, will be sustained.
	A significant portion of PreAxia’s financial resources will continue to be directed to the development of its products and
	to marketing activities. The success of PreAxia will ultimately depend on its ability to generate revenues from its product sales,
	such that the business development and marketing activities may be financed by revenues from operations instead of external financing.


	There is no assurance that future
	revenues will be sufficient to generate the required funds to continue such business development and marketing activities.



	Our directors and officers
	may face conflicts of interest.



	Certain directors and officers
	of PreAxia may become associated with other reporting issuers or other corporations which may give rise to conflicts of interest.
	Directors who have a material interest or any person who is a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with
	PreAxia are required, subject to certain exceptions, to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution
	to approve the contract. In addition, the directors are required to act honestly, and in good faith, with a view to the best interests
	of PreAxia, as the case may be.


	Certain of the directors may
	have, other employment, other business, or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly, these directors will only be able
	to devote part of their time to the affairs of PreAxia.



	PreAxia does not have key
	man insurance.



	PreAxia does not currently have
	key man insurance in place in respect of any of its senior officers or personnel.



	Acquisitions, investments
	and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our investors and other negative consequences.



	It is our current intention to
	engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual
	properties, and other assets. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not yet identified any such
	strategic transactions. Any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
	In our search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities.
	We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments, or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business
	or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company or business, or
	successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of our management’s
	time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.


	Additional risks we may face
	include:



	The need to implement or remediate
	controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that, prior to the acquisition, lacked
	these controls, procedures and policies;


	Cultural challenges associated with
	integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization;


	Retaining key employees from the businesses
	we acquire, and


	The need to integrate an acquired company’s
	accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management.







	 



	13



	 







	 




	Future acquisitions and investments
	could involve the issuance of our equity securities, potentially diluting our existing stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent
	liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired in-process technology, or other increased
	expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or
	evaluate future acquisitions or investments.



	Fluctuations in quarterly
	operating results lead to unpredictability of revenue and earnings.



	The timing of the release of
	health care payments processing products and services can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations. A significant
	portion of revenue in any quarter may be derived from sales of products and services introduced in that quarter or established
	in the immediately preceding quarter. If we are unable to begin to generate sales of products and services during the scheduled
	quarter, our revenue and earnings will be negatively affected in that period. Quarterly operating results also may be materially
	impacted by factors, including the level of market acceptance, or demand for health payment processing products and services and
	the level of development and/or promotion expenses for health payment processing products and services. Consequently, if net revenue
	in a period is below expectations, our operating results and financial position in that period are likely to be negatively affected,
	as has occurred in the past.




	Risks Related to our Common Stock





	There is currently no trading
	market for our common stock.



	There is currently no trading
	market for our common stock. Our common stock is not quoted on any exchange or inter-dealer quotation system. There is no trading
	market for our common stock and our common stock may never be included for trading on any stock exchange or through any quotation
	system (including, without limitation, the NASDAQ Stock Market and the OTC Bulletin Board). You may not be able to sell your shares
	due to the absence of a trading market. Any market that develops for our common stock likely will be illiquid and the price of
	our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations.



	A decline in the price of
	our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations
	and we may go out of business.



	A prolonged decline in the price
	of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital.
	Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through
	the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations
	because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for
	all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative
	effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations.
	As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our
	financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.







	Because we do not intend to
	pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return
	on their shares unless they sell them.



	We intend to retain any
	future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on
	our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the
	discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and
	financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant.
	There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to
	the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their
	shares unless they sell them.

	Our stock is a penny stock.
	Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations which may limit a shareholder’s ability
	to buy and sell our stock.



	Our stock is a penny stock. The
	Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security
	that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
	exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
	who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor”
	refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
	annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to
	a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form
	prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of
	the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny
	stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information,
	must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing
	before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny
	stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is
	a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure
	requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject
	to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities.
	We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.



	FINRA sales practice requirements
	may also limit a shareholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.



	In addition to the “penny
	stock” rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
	has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for
	believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional
	customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status,
	investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability
	that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult
	for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.

	ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	General Overview




	Our company undertakes all of
	its operations through PreAxia Canada, our wholly-owned subsidiary. PreAxia Canada is a company which intends to deliver a comprehensive
	suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market, specifically the opportunities tied to the growth
	of HSAs. There is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant
	opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market.


	Spawned by the need to address
	escalating health care costs, changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in
	the management of their health benefits, the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming
	increasingly blurred. With the trend towards self-directed health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster, easier and
	more convenient growth conduct, studies suggest that HSA’s in the US reached $30 billion in assets and 16.7 million consumers
	in 2015, an increase of more than 20% over the prior year. This coupled with the continued growth of the Canadian group insurance
	industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services. We intend to initially launch our products
	in Canada. We believe that Canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing vehicle to control costs, increase profitability
	and get more return from their investment. We intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity.




	Plan of Operation




	Over the next twelve months,
	we plan to:




	 



	(a)




	Raise additional capital to execute our business plans, and;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(b)




	To penetrate the health payment processing market in Canada, and worldwide, by continuing to develop innovative health payment processing products and services, and;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(c)




	Build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies, governments and other alliances in various vertical markets, and;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(d)




	Fill the positions of senior management sales, administrative and engineering positions.

	Cash Requirements




	After a further review of business
	opportunities with industry consultants, for the next twelve months and given that we meet our forecasted expenses, we plan to
	spend a total of approximately $1,550,000 in implementing our business plan of developing and marketing of health care processing
	products and services. We do not expect to generate any revenues during the year. Therefore, we will be required to raise a total
	of $3,222,400 to complete our business plan and pay our existing outstanding debts of approximately $1,672,400. Our working capital
	requirements for both our company and PreAxia Canada for the next twelve months are estimated at $1,550,000 distributed as follows:









	Estimated Expenses




	 





	General and Administrative




	$300,000






	Research and Development




	$450,000






	Marketing and Education




	$450,000






	Professional Services




	$350,000







	Total





	$1,550,000






	Our estimated expenses over the
	next twelve months are broken down as follows:




	 



	1.





	General and Administrative

	We anticipate spending approximately $300,000 on general and administration costs in the next twelve months, which will include office rent, office supplies, transfer agents, filing fees, bank service charges, salary for our administrator, interest expense and travel, which includes airfare, meals, car rentals and accommodations.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	2.





	Research and Development

	We anticipate that we may spend approximately $450,000 in the next twelve months in the maintenance of our development and additional acquisition of software for our processing services and products.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	3.





	Marketing and Education

	We anticipate spending approximately $450,000 on the costs of staff and personnel marketing and promoting our company, our products and services, and educating the public to attract new accounts, including staff and personnel.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	4.





	Professional Services

	We anticipate that we may spend up to $350,000 in cash and/or stock based compensation over the next twelve months for professional services, consulting fees, accounting, auditing and legal fees.







	Off-balance Sheet Arrangements




	We have no off-balance sheet
	arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
	stockholders.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	As of May 31, 2016, we had a
	cash balance of $7,151 compared to $3,062, as at May 31, 2015. PreAxia Canada will be required to raise capital to fund our operations.
	We had a working capital deficit of $1,665,249 as of May 31, 2016 compared with a working capital deficit of $1,732,715 as of May
	31, 2015.


	Our company currently has
	little cash on hand. Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued
	issuance of equity to new stockholders, and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. Our company’s
	cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve month period.
	We will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the start-up stage with PreAxia Canada. We
	project that we will require an estimated additional $3,215,249 over the next twelve month period to fund our operating cash
	shortfall calculated as $1,665,249 to cover our working capital deficit plus $1,550,000 for our projected cash request for
	the year ended May 31, 2016. Our company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate short-term needs and
	additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the
	private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as our company may determine.

	There are no assurances that
	we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will
	be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able
	to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and
	we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.


	There is substantial doubt about
	our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing,
	successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional
	equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial
	loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.


	Our financial condition as at
	May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:

	created a net loss of $265,598 which was offset by accounts payable related party of $127,032, accrued interest of $30,093 and

	losses and have incurred a loss of $3,695,626 from inception to May 31, 2016. Because of these historical losses, we will require
	additional working capital to develop our business operations. We intend to raise additional working capital through private placements,
	public offerings, bank financing and/or advances from related parties or shareholder loans.


	The continuation of our business
	is dependent upon obtaining further financing and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional
	equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current or future stockholders. Obtaining
	commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.


	There are no assurances that
	we will be able to either (i) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (ii) obtain
	additional financing through either private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working
	capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank
	financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing
	will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If adequate working capital is not available, we may cease
	operations.


	These conditions raise substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
	recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
	should we be unable to continue as a going concern.




	Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies




	The preparation of financial
	statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures of our company. Although
	these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions that our company may undertake in the future,
	actual results may differ from such estimates.



	Use of Estimates in the preparation
	of the financial statements

	The preparation of our company's
	financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	Our company considers all highly
	liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



	Foreign Currency Translation



	The functional currency of our
	company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of PreAxia Canada is the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities in
	the accompanying financial statements are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet
	date and capital accounts are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of
	exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to
	period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) account in stockholders’ deficit.


	Transactions undertaken in currencies
	other than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date. Any
	exchange gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.



	Gain (Loss) Per Share



	Gain (loss) per share of common
	stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Fully
	diluted earnings per share are not presented because they are anti-dilutive.



	Research and Development Costs




	The
	Company accounts for software development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including FASB ASC 730, Research
	and Development, FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, FASB 985-20, Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed
	and FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs



	.




	Costs incurred during the period
	of planning and design, prior to the period determining technological feasibility, for all software developed for use internal
	and external, has been charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs.  Additionally, costs
	incurred after determination of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development.


	The Company has capitalized certain
	costs in the development of our proprietary software (computer software to be sold, leased or licensed) for the period after technological
	feasibility was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales.


	Website development costs have
	been capitalized, under the same criteria as our marketed software.  


	Capitalized software costs are
	stated at cost.  The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project. Intangible software
	costs are amortized over a three year period starting in June 2014.




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements








	 



	23



	 







	 




	The Company reviews new accounting
	standards as issued or updated. No new standards or updates had any material effect on these financial statements. The accounting
	pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements that were considered significant by management
	were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent
	pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM


	 


	 


	To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Preaxia Health Care Payment Systems, Inc.


	 


	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Preaxia Health Care Payment Systems, Inc., (the Company) as of May
	31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash
	flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.


	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
	on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of

	Preaxia Health Care Payment Systems

	, Inc. as of May 31, 2016
	and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
	financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit and has suffered recurring losses from operations. These factors,
	among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
	in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	PREAXIA
	HEALTH CARE PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC.




	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	May 31, 2016 and 2015



	Note 1 – Summary of significant accounting
	policies



	This summary of significant accounting
	policies of PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (the “Company”) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management
	who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements,
	which are stated in U.S. Dollars.




	Organization




	PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems
	Inc. (the “Company” or “PreAxia”) was incorporated on April 3, 2000 in the State of Nevada. On May 31,
	2005 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Tiempo de Mexico Ltd. (“Tiempo”) in exchange for 5,000,000
	shares of the common stock of the Company with a par value of $0.001. The Company had no operations prior to the date of the aforementioned
	acquisition.


	On May 30, 2008, the Company
	finalized the execution of an acquisition agreement dated April 22, 2008 (the “Acquisition Agreement”) between PreAxia,
	PreAxia Canada (formerly H Pay Card Inc.), Tiempo, Kimberley Coonfer (“Coonfer”), Caribbean Overseas Investments Ltd.
	(“Caribbean”) and the stockholders of PreAxia Canada (the “PreAxia Canada Stockholders”). Under the terms
	of the Acquisition Agreement, PreAxia acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of PreAxia Canada resulting in PreAxia
	Canada becoming a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of PreAxia. Upon the acquisition of PreAxia Canada by PreAxia, PreAxia issued
	the stockholders of PreAxia Canada an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of the common stock of PreAxia. Pursuant to the terms of the
	Acquisition Agreement all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s subsidiary, Tiempo (the “Tiempo Shares”)
	were transferred to Coonfer and Caribbean in exchange for the return of treasury of a total of 5,000,000 common shares of PreAxia
	(the “Cancellation Shares”). The Cancellation Shares were exchanged for the Tiempo Shares and $100,000 of the intercompany
	debt between Tiempo and PreAxia was written off on the books of Tiempo and PreAxia, and Tiempo provided a promissory note for the
	remaining intercompany debt between Tiempo and PreAxia in the amount of $49,281. As of May 30, 2008, Tiempo is no longer a subsidiary
	of PreAxia, PreAxia Canada Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PreAxia. PreAxia Canada Inc. Stockholders received an aggregate
	of 12,000,000 shares of PreAxia’s common stock representing 78.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Tom
	Zapatinas, an Officer and Director of PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc., is also an Officer and Director of PreAxia Canada
	Inc. He disclosed such information and interest in this transaction to the Board of Directors prior to the conclusion of this transaction.


	As a result, the consolidated
	results of operations presented at May 31, 2016 and 2015 are those of the Company and PreAxia Canada Inc. PreAxia Canada Inc. was
	incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta on January 28, 2008. Since inception of PreAxia Canada Inc., its business
	objective has been the development, distribution, marketing and sale of health care payment processing services and products.




	Nature and Continuance of Operations




	The Company has not yet realized
	any revenues from its planned operations.

	PREAXIA HEALTH CARE PAYMENT
	SYSTEMS INC.


	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	May 31, 2016



	Note 1 – Summary of significant accounting
	policies (Continued)





	Nature and Continuance
	of Operations

	(Continued)



	The primary operations of the
	Company will eventually be undertaken by PreAxia Canada. PreAxia Canada is in the process of developing an online access system
	creating a health savings account that allows card payments and processing services to third-party administrators, insurance companies
	and others.


	These consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a
	going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal
	year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these consolidated financial statements
	do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should
	the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At May 31, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations,
	has accumulated losses of $3,695,626 since inception, has negative working capital of $1,665,249 and expects to incur further losses
	in the development of its business, all of which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
	concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable
	operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business
	operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but believes the Company will be
	able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional
	funding being available.




	Use of Estimates in the
	preparation of the consolidated financial statements




	The preparation of the Company's
	consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying
	notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	PREAXIA HEALTH CARE PAYMENT
	SYSTEMS INC.


	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	May 31, 2016 and 2015



	Note 1 – Summary of
	significant accounting policies (Continued)





	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	The Company considers all highly
	liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




	Foreign Currency Translation




	The functional currency of the
	Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of PreAxia Canada is the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities in
	the accompanying consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at
	the balance sheet date and capital accounts are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the
	average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates
	from period to period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) account in stockholders’ deficit.


	Transactions undertaken in currencies
	other than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date. Any
	exchange gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.




	Gain (Loss) Per Share




	Gain (loss) per share of common
	stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.




	Research and Development
	Costs




	Research and development costs
	are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.




	Intangible Software Costs




	Intangible software costs are
	amortized over a three year period starting June 2014. Amortization for the year ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 was $34,050 and $34,050,
	respectively.



	Impairment of Long-lived Assets



	Long-lived
	assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
	that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
	based on the fair value of the asset.  The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value
	of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required.  If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
	is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount
	and fair value of the asset.  When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected
	future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.  We did
	not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.

	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



	The Company’s balance sheet
	includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value
	because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. Related
	party balances are not recorded at fair value because they are by nature not arm’s length transactions subject to normal
	market rates.



	Fair Value Estimates



	The Company defines fair value
	as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
	advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Management
	uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained
	from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
	developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists
	of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described
	below:







	·




	Level 1 - Unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities










	·




	Level 2 - Inputs other
	than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including
	quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
	in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
	rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.










	·




	Level 3 - Inputs that
	are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.







	Fair value estimates discussed
	herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of May 31, 2016. The respective
	carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of
	these instruments.




	New Accounting Standards





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The Company reviews new accounting standards
	as issued or updated. No new standards or updates had any material effect on these consolidated financial statements. The accounting
	pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements that were considered significant by management
	were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent
	pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements as presented.

	Going Concern




	The accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements, the Company has incurred cumulative net losses of ($3,695,626) since inception, and currently has no sales.
	The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the design,
	development and commercialization of its health care payment processing services and products. Management has plans to seek additional
	capital through private placements of its common stock. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be
	necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.

	Accounts Payable




	During the year ended May 31,
	2016, the Company’s president, Tom Zapatinas, invoiced $120,000 for management services rendered to the Company for the period
	June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. As at May 31, 2016, Accounts payable – related party includes a total of $960,376 due and payable
	to Mr. Zapatinas. The balance as at May 31, 2015 was $1,088,044. The decrease of $127,668 was due to the conversion of $248,600
	into shares offset by increases for consulting services of $120,000 and travel expenses of $932. There are no terms of repayment
	for this payable.


	As of May 31, 2016, the Company
	owed loan holders $410,455 compared to $419,815 as at 31 May, 2015. The decrease of $9,360 is due to the change in exchange rate
	on the loans over the year. The terms of repayment are 30 days after demand is made by the loan holder.


	Included in the amount above, the
	Company had a loan payable to a shareholder of the Company in the amount of $53,438. The loan was unsecured, with 6% interest per
	annum and was payable 30 days after demand is made by the shareholder. As of May 31, 2016 the Company had accrued interest on the
	related party loan in the amount of $16,873 compared to $14,342 as at 31 May, 2015. The increase of $2,531 is due to interest accrued
	for the year of $3,318 offset by the change in exchange rate totalling $787.

	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
	ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE



	On August
	10, 2015, the Company engaged Heaton & Company, PLLC to act as the Company’s independent registered public accountant.


	The engagement
	of Heaton & Company, PLLC and the dismissal of the prior accountants was done by the Chief Executive Officer and member of
	the Board of the Company, with the knowledge and approval of the other members of the Board of Directors.  The Company has
	an audit committee charged with oversight of financial matters.


	Since their
	engagement and to the date of their dismissal, there have not been, nor are there now, any disagreements between the Company and
	DKM Certified Public Accountants with respect to any matter of accounting principles, practices, financial statement disclosure,
	auditing scope or procedure for the reporting and filing completed prior to this date, nor have there been any “reportable
	events” as defined by Regulation S-K section 304(a)(1)(v) during that same period, other than the reports were modified to
	contain a going concern opinion.






	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	Evaluation of Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures




	Management, evaluated the effectiveness
	of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief
	Executive Officer concluded that, as of May 31, 2016, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness
	of our Company’s disclosure controls and procedures was due to the existence of material weaknesses identified below.


	Disclosure controls and procedures
	are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Company’s
	Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange
	Commission’s rules and forms.




	Management’s Report
	On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	Our management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
	and 14d-14(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles.


	All internal control systems,
	no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
	determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting reliability and financial
	statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
	to risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.


	Management assessed the effectiveness
	of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016. In making the assessment, management used
	the criteria issued by the

	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO - 2013) in Internal Control-Integrated
	Framework

	. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of May 31, 2016, our Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting was not effective.


	Management has identified the
	following material weaknesses:



	We do not have accounting staff with
	sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for U.S. income taxes and complex US GAAP matters; and


	We failed to file our corporate tax
	returns for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.







	 



	25



	 







	 




	We intend to take appropriate
	and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these material weaknesses. In particular, we intend to hire
	staff with U.S. GAAP expertise if we can obtain additional financing and hire professionals to prepare and complete the filing
	of our corporate tax returns.




	Changes in Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting




	There have been no changes in
	our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or
	are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.






	ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION



	Mr. Jim Kenney has resigned from
	the Board of Directors effective February 2, 2015 citing his work schedule would no longer allow him to give the position the necessary
	time to contribute to the Company.

	since January 25, 2008. Mr. Zapatinas has been a self-employed business consultant since August, 1997. In June of 1998, Mr. Zapatinas
	founded Prolific Smart Card Software Systems Inc. which became a reporting issuer on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. Mr. Zapatinas
	resigned from Prolific in May 29, 2001, to go back to his consulting practice. He brings experience in financing, corporate development

	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE



	 




	Corporate
	Governance relates to the activities of the Board of Directors. National Policy 58-201 establishes corporate governance
	guidelines which apply to all public companies. The Corporation has reviewed its own

	corporate
	governance practices in light of these guidelines. In certain cases, the Corporation’s practices comply with the
	guidelines, however, the Board considers that some of the guidelines are not suitable for the Corporation at its current
	stage of development and therefore these guidelines have not been adopted. National Policy 58-201 mandates disclosure of
	corporate governance practices which disclosure is set out below. The Board is committed to sound corporate governance
	practices in the interest of its shareholders and contribute to effective and efficient decision making. The Corporation will
	continue to review and implement corporate governance guidelines as the business of the Corporation progresses.

	Independence of Members of Board



	The Corporation’s Board
	consists of one director, Tom Zapatinas who is not independent as he is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

	 




	Management Supervision by Board



	The size of the Corporation is
	such that all of the Corporation’s operations are conducted by a small management team which is also represented on the Board.
	The Board considers that management is effectively supervised by the director on an informal basis as the director is actively
	and regularly involved in reviewing the operations of the Corporation and has regular and full access to management.



	Other Directorships



	Tom Zapatinas is not a director
	of any other reporting issuers.



	Orientation and Continuing Education



	The Board does not have a formal
	orientation or education program for its members. New Board members are provided with information respecting the functioning of
	the Board of Directors, audit committee, access to all of the publicly filed documents of the Corporation and complete access to
	management and the Corporation’s professional advisors.


	Board members are encouraged
	to communicate with management and the auditors, to keep themselves current with industry trends and developments and changes in
	legislation with the Corporation’s assistance, to attend industry seminars and to visit the Corporation’s operations.
	Board members have full access to the Corporation’s records and legal counsel.



	Ethical Business Conduct



	The Board believes good corporate
	governance in an integral component to the success of the Corporation and to meet responsibilities to shareholders.


	At present the Board has not
	adopted guidelines or stipulations or a code to encourage and promote a culture of ethical business conduct due to the size of
	its Board and its limited activities. The Corporation does promote ethical business conduct through the nomination of Board members
	it considers ethical.



	Nomination of Directors



	The Board has responsibility
	for identifying and assessing potential Board candidates. Recruitment of new directors has generally resulted from recommendations
	made by directors, management and shareholders. The Board assesses potential Board candidates to fill perceived needs on the Board
	for required skills, expertise, independence and other factors.



	Compensation of Directors
	and the CEO



	The directors decide as a
	Board the compensation for the Corporation’s directors and officers. Compensation payable is determined by considering
	compensation paid for directors and CEOs of companies of similar size and stage of development in the health care payment
	industry and determining appropriate compensation reflecting the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and
	effort expended by the directors and senior management while taking into account the financial and other resources of the
	Corporation. In setting the compensation, the performance of the CEO is reviewed in light of the Corporation’s
	objectives and other factors that may have impacted the success of the Corporation.








	 



	30



	 







	 







	Board Committees



	The Corporation has an Audit
	Committee (see section entitled “Audit Committee”)


	The Board is of the view that
	the size of the Corporation’s operations does not warrant additional committees at this stage of the Corporation’s
	development.



	Assessments



	The Board does not consider that
	formal assessments would be useful at this stage of the Corporation’s development.




	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
	Compliance




	Section 16(a) of the Securities
	Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports
	regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with
	copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations from
	certain reporting persons, we believe that during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 all filing requirements applicable to our
	executive officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial owners were complied with.






	ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	The following table sets forth
	all compensation received during the two years ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 by our principal executive officer and principal
	financial officer and each of the other most highly compensated executive officers whose total compensation exceeded $100,000 in
	such fiscal year. These officers are referred to as the Named Executive Officers in this report.

	plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We adopted and approved
	our current stock option plan on January 28, 2010, pursuant to which we may grant stock options to acquire up to 2,000,000 shares
	of our common stock. Our directors and executive officers may receive stock options at the discretion of our board of directors
	in the future. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or
	may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of our board of
	directors from time to time.




	Termination of Employment
	and Change in Control Arrangements




	We have no plans or arrangements
	in respect of remuneration received or that may be received by our executive officers to compensate such officers in the event
	of termination of employment (as a result of resignation, retirement, change of control) or a change of responsibilities following
	a change of control.

	We reimburse our directors for
	expenses incurred in connection with attending board meetings but did not pay director’s fees or other cash compensation
	for services rendered as a director in the year ended May 31, 2016. We have no present formal plan for compensating our directors
	for their service in their capacity as directors, although in the future, such directors are expected to receive compensation and
	options to purchase shares of common stock as awarded by our board of directors or (as to future options) a compensation committee
	which may be established in the future. Directors are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses
	incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of our board of directors. The board of directors may award special remuneration
	to any director undertaking any special services on behalf of our company other than services ordinarily required of a director.
	Other than indicated in this annual report, no director received and/or accrued any compensation for his or her services as a director,
	including committee participation and/or special assignments

	The following table sets forth,

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "intends", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential", or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Such factors include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; the ability of PreAxia to sustain, manage or forecast its growth; the ability of PreAxia to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other factors referenced in this and previous filings.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  Given these uncertainties, readers of this Form 10-Q and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. PreAxia disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States.  All dollar amounts stated herein are in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.  The management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2012, together with notes thereto. As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", "PreAxia" and the "Company" means PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, PreAxia Canada Inc. ("PreAxia Canada") formerly PreAxia Health Care Payment System Inc. and, before that, H Pay Card Ltd., unless the context clearly requires otherwise.  General Overview  PreAxia and PreAxia Canada are both development stage companies. PreAxia Canada is a company which offers a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market, specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of Health Spending Accounts ("HSAs") and generally as a payment service between health care providers and consumers. Put differently, PreAxia offers a health care payment model that incorporates certain attributes of both PayPal and virtual banking. There is a shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market.  The Canadian economy has undergone unprecedented growth over the past two decades. During this same period, the Internet has dramatically changed our way of communicating and conducting business. This has had dramatic effects on key industries such as retail, banking and travel. Consumers have shown a preference for relying on the Internet to handle many aspects of their personal and professional lives. This, in turn, has forced businesses to adapt. While the Health Care Industry has also grown during this time, the consumer has seen neither cost nor efficiency savings comparable to what has occurred in other industries.  PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems is a market disrupting technology that takes advantage of important trends in our society. Government budgets are strained. With health care requiring a large and growing portion of these budgets, it seems inevitable that efforts to reduce government expenditures are likely to target these health care expenditures. Reductions in government funding of health care services mean that individuals will have to take more individual responsibility for covering at least some of these costs. The growing responsibility for directly funding one's own future health care expenditures combined with a desire to manage all sorts of financial dealings through the Internet presents the opportunity that PreAxia has now begun to exploit.  PreAxia has found a better way to service an existing and growing need. Utilizing the Internet to automate and eliminate paperwork, the company was developed to reflect the growing demand for Health Spending Accounts (HSAs) as tax free vehicle for managing and controlling health care expenditures.  The growing interest in HSAs has fuelled the need for fund management and adjudication services, hence the creation and growth of Third Party Administrators (TPAs). The HSA/TPA clients are referred by Brokerage Firms and Independent Brokers, who receive a referral commission. The HSA industry is primarily focused on small to medium-size businesses which can, since 2003, offer HSAs as part of their employee benefits package. The incentive for a traditional insurer such as Manulife to service the small to medium-size employer (under 50 lives) with anything other than their traditional, premium-driven health insurance products is on the whole too small to warrant significant (i.e. costly) marketing efforts or the introduction of competing HSA-type products.  Using health plan innovations, including the HSA, these new alternative providers of employee health benefits have successfully gained an estimated 10% share of the $26-$30 Billion Canadian health benefits annual market.  Description of Health Spending Account ("HSA")  An HSA is a uniquely designed bank account established exclusively and specifically for the purpose of health care spending. An employer deposits funds into a special account for the employee. These funds can be used to pay for eligible medical and related health care expenses for the employee and their dependents. HSAs provide employers and employees with greater control in both the amount of funds invested and how these funds are used.  Services and infrastructure provided by PreAxia enable organizations and individuals to eliminate all paper involved in the management of these accounts and benefit through savings in time and money.  The PreAxia platform for processing and managing accounts, including cardholder and customer account management, reconciliation and financial settlement, and customer reporting is fully operational.  Over time, the company will evaluate opportunities for forms of virtual banking and PayPal-type services. One opportunity seen as particularly relevant to the health care market is to offer instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund Pre-Paid Interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in real time. If implemented, the beneficiary will most likely select a personal identification number ("PIN") using a PIN and card activation terminal, thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded. This consideration would require development of software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that would be fully managed by a data center.  Distribution Methods and Marketing Strategy  PreAxia operates on a Cloud Computing Platform that makes it accessible to anyone with a personal computer and Internet access. The preliminary market for PreAxia's HSA Management Solution is small and medium sized companies that are not currently well served by the current group benefits model. The financial benefits of the PreAxia business model, however, are also relevant to larger employers and we believe that these larger employers will migrate to the PreAxia product over time.  PreAxia's s marketing strategy is to promote its existing platform to the groups that most need access to it. Namely, independent brokers, financial advisors and small to medium sized businesses. Brokers should see PreAxia as a superior method of promoting and supporting HSAs that allow them to earn above average commission rates on invested funds. Financial advisors should see PreAxia in a similar way as brokers except that there is the additional benefit of tax reduction. Small to medium sized businesses, which are expected to drive the growth in business, should see PreAxia as offering financial savings to the company and to employees by offering personal health care benefits through an HSA, along with the same conveniences they have come to expect from other services they currently utilize over the Internet. It is expected that the group benefits market will subsequently follow as they too realize the advantages of PreAxia over their current HSA offerings. PreAxia has begun and will continue to seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance partners to establish reference-able, high-profile implementations and market-leading, early-adopter firms for further developing innovative products and services. The company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management, financial risk, audit management and cash management while targeting product/service management as a support to financial management.  We anticipate that the prime target for services will be small to medium sized organizations that are not adequately served by the current insurance and group benefits offerings. These organizations should realize significant benefits in both cost and time savings by utilization of PreAxia technology while providing their employees with an increased level of benefits.  PreAxia intends to achieve service volume and the associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary transaction volumes, through market specific channel partners and through an education based public relations strategy geared to the small to mid-sized employers including the brokers and financial advisors utilized by these businesses. The channel strategy is supported in the solution design, as multiple channel partners will require branding and our company's fee charging/collection capabilities.  It is our company's intention that brokers and financial advisors will aggressively promote their PreAxia supported HSA offerings due to the quality of product, higher margins and because of the non-competitive relationship with PreAxia.  PreAxia has identified the following "channels" through which it will target prime end market customers:  Independent brokers that sell, or desire to sell, Health Spending Accounts  Financial advisors who manage funds and advise on tax saving strategies for individuals and corporations  MGAs that provide services and education to the broker community  Accountants and bookkeepers who regularly advise businesses on financial and operational matters  Benefits managers/adjudicators, including insurance, health or outsourced government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement  Issuer banks, including partner banks that enable the issuance of Health Cards and/or sell insurance products  Application providers, including software manufacturers selling into the target vertical markets  Professional services, including consulting, development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets  PreAxia intends to establish several key customer reference accounts, channel marketing partners and technology alliances. These corporate relationships are relevant to advancing our company's goals in 2013 and beyond for achieving a prime position in the Canadian marketplace and establishing a solid service foundation.  Competitive Business Conditions and our Company's Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition  PreAxia intends to offer a combination of products and services in its solution. However, there are other providers of components or versions of the service offerings in the marketplace. PreAxia is taking a unique approach by focusing exclusively on Health Spending Accounts and making it available on a Cloud Computing platform that provides both the sellers and users of this product with a superior offering. Also uniquely, PreAxia offers a differentiating USP to brokers by operating in a non-competitive position thereby acting as a partner to the brokers that ultimately sell HSAs. As awareness of PreAxia's product grows in the marketplace, the company will seek out opportunities to expand its market share by integrating with the group benefits industry. The company also intends to expand its offering to markets in the USA and elsewhere. The following are some of the providers of products and services that are or may be potential competitors in PreAxia's target markets:  Benecaid has become a leading provider of Health Spending Accounts in Canada by offering an easy to understand product through brokers and also directly through the company.  Olympia Benefits has become a leading provider of Health Spending Accounts in Canada by offering a "Cost Plus" version of HSAs that has become popular in the marketplace.  QuickCard is a provider of Health Spending Accounts and group insurance products. They are partially differentiated from competitors by virtue of a "credit type card" that is used to pay for qualified health products and services.  Most major insurance companies offer some version of HSAs to their customers.  Many brokers have created HSA products for their clients.  Many accounting and financial services firms have created their own HSA products to offer to their clients.  Intangible Properties  When negotiating its arrangements with clients, PreAxia intends to ensure that all rights to and ownership of its intellectual property remains with the company. We anticipate that source codes or other proprietary knowledge will be protected through agreements entered into between PreAxia and its employees and contractors, and additional high standards of confidentiality and protection of data are set by clients and regulatory authorities within the industry.  Intellectual Property and Patent Protection  At present, PreAxia has two trademarks pending. One is for the company name (PreAxia) and another is for the company logo design.  Plan of Operation  Over the next twelve months, we plan to:  (a) Raise additional capital to execute our business plans;  (b) Penetrate the health care processing market in Canada, and worldwide, by continuing to develop innovative health care processing products and services;  (c) Build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies, governments and other alliances in various vertical markets; and  (d) Fill the positions of senior management sales, administrative and engineering positions.  Cash Requirements  After a further review of business opportunities with industry consultants, for the next twelve months and given that we meet our forecasted expenses, we plan to spend a total of approximately $1,550,000 in implementing our business plan of development and marketing of health care processing products and services. We do not expect to generate any revenues this year, therefore we will be required to raise a total of $2,950,000 to complete our business plan and pay our outstanding debts of approximately $1,400,000. Our working capital requirements for PreAxia Canada for the next twelve months are estimated at $1,550,000 distributed, as follows:  Estimated Expenses General and Administrative $ 300,000 Research and Development 450,000 Marketing and Education 450,000 Professional Services 350,000 Total $ 1,550,000  Our estimated expenses over the next twelve months are broken down as follows:  1. General and Administrative. We anticipate spending approximately $300,000 on general and administration costs in the next twelve months, which will include staff fees, office rent, office supplies, transfer agents, filing fees, bank service charges, salaries for our administration, interest expense and travel, which includes airfare, meals, car rentals and accommodations.  2. Research and Development. We anticipate that we may spend approximately $450,000 in the next twelve months in the development and acquisition of software for our processing services and products.  3. Marketing and Education. We anticipate spending approximately $450,000 as the costs of staff and personnel, marketing and promoting our Company, our products and services, and educating the public to attract new accounts.  4. Professional Services. We anticipate that we may spend up to $350,000 in the next twelve months for professional services, which includes, stock-based compensation, accounting, auditing, legal fees and investor relations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of August 31, 2012, PreAxia's cash balance was $15,611 compared to $8,468 as at May 31, 2012. Our Company will be required to raise capital to fund our operations. PreAxia's cash on hand is currently its only source of liquidity. PreAxia had a working capital deficit of $1,282,811 as of August 31, 2012 compared with a working capital deficit of $1,186,762 as of May 31, 2012.  Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders, and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. PreAxia's cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve month period. We will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the development stage. We project that we will require an estimated additional $2,950,000 over the next twelve month period to fund our operating cash shortfall and to complete our business plan. Our company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as PreAxia may determine.  During the three month period ended August 31, 2012, we obtained additional loans from related parties in the amount of $52,000 and received $25,000 in respect of a subscription agreement for 50,000 shares at $.50 per share. These share issuances were approved by our board of directors. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.  There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  Our working capital (deficit) as at August 31, 2012 compared to May 31, 2012 is summarized as follows:  Working Capital August 31, 2012 May 31,2012 Current Assets $ 15,611 $ 8,468 Current Liabilities 1,298,422 1,195,230 Working Capital (deficit) $ (1,282,811 ) $ (1,186,762 )  The increase in our working capital deficit of $96,049 was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable related party.  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Results of Operations  The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2012.  For the three month period ended August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011  Our operating results for the three month period ended August 31, 2012 compared to the three month period ended August 31, 2011 are described below:  Revenue  We have not earned any revenues since our inception and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have completed the development of our Health Card software and obtained new customers.  Expenses  Our net operating loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2012 was $69,356 compared to $160,564 for the three month period ended August 31, 2011. The decrease in loss of $91,208 for the three month period ending August 31, 2012 is due to a decrease in expenses of $28,233 for research and development, an increase of $12,187 for wages and benefits, a decrease of $1,295 for rent, a decrease in the amount of $24,331 for professional fees and a decrease in the amount of $224 in office and administration fees.  Research and Development  Research and Development expenses decreased by $28,233 in the three month period ended August 31, 2012 compared to the three month period ended August 31, 2011, due to the completion of major project components.  Wages and Benefits  Wages and benefits increased by $12,187 during the three month period ended August 31, 2012 compared to August 31, 2011, as a result of the hire of a general manager.  Office and Administration  Office and administration expenses decreased by $223 for the period ended August 31, 2012 compared to August 31, 2011, due to a decrease in expenses.  Professional Fees  Professional fees decreased by $24,331 during the three months ended August 31, 2012 compared to August 31, 2011, due to a decrease in accounting and legal fees.  Rent  Rent increased by $1,295 during the three months ended August 31, 2012 compared to August 31, 2011 due to the exchange rate on rent.  Critical Accounting Policies  We have identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations.  Revenue recognition  PreAxia recognizes revenue in accordance with the provision of the Securities and Exchange Commission which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. This provision requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Research and development  All costs of research and development activities are expensed as incurred.  Mar 31, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
