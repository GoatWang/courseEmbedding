CreditRiskMonitor helps corporate credit, procurement and finance professionals stay ahead of financial risk with comprehensive commercial credit reports, risk analysis and monitoring for more than 57,000 active, publicly-traded companies worldwide. 

Reports typically include detailed financial statements, ratios, peer analyses, bond agency ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch, when available, and our proprietary FRISK® score, proven 96% accurate in predicting financial failure of public companies.
This FREE directory includes those 57,000+ companies plus more than 10,000 entities with agency ratings but no financials, worldwide. 

We also collect trade payments data and public filings (suits, liens, judgments, and bankruptcy filings) on millions of private businesses, primarily U.S. The private companies are not included in this directory. Their reports are accessible only to CreditRiskMonitor subscribers.
