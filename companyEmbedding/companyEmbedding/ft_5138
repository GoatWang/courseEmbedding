        VERY FRUSTRATING
Bought the rubbermaid 5-8ft complete closet kit. Spent almost 2 hours measuring and trying to install before realizing that the box says 5-8ft but the instructions say 6-8ft and that all the equipement is for 6ft are larger!!! What a waste of TIME AND MONEY this was. VERY DISAPPOINTED that a company as well known as RUBBERMAID would mislabel there products. We bought 2 for our his and hers closets so we know it wasnt just one box that was a mistake. I DO NOT SUGGESTED THIS PRODUCT!!!!

I bought this kit to install in my kids closet. It was easy to install, I was able to add an extra shelf, it fit perfectly into the closet, and it functions wonderfully for small children. We have room for baskets on the shelves and also on the floor of the closet. This product is great for kids and small closet spaces.

While this wasn't the worst thing we have ever had to "build" it was a challenge! The instructions with the "measurements" included in the packet were pretty much useless but looking at the diagram you can get a pretty good idea what you should be doing. I wish there were a few extra parts included as we cut down the long shelves enough that I could have used the left over shelf as a middle shelf but had no way to attach it. Really would be better off using some sort of rubber washer and slide over pole shelving. But once complete it does it job. I would like to also see more "add ons" for the product. They seem to waste alot of space that could be used for wire drawers, or more shelving. We used some inexpensive hanging shoe organizers to fix this problem. In the end this gets 4 stars only because I was able to make it work with inexpensive additions.

        Worst experience
I have assembled many cabinets, book- cases, other closet organizers, and I have never experienced the frustration I had with this product. I got one shelf up and decided I was done. I threw it in the garbage. All the measuring and leveling and reading and rereading was ridiculous.

        Great Assembly, But
Easy to assemble, but the directions said to put the holes at 66 7/8" off the floor. That dimension is exactly 1" off (it should be 67 7/8"). I ended up drilling a new hole in the front support pole 1" down from the original hole.
