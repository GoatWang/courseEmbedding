CHALLENGEPatient TrackingCHALLENGE Keeping track of patients in sensitive care environments is a vitally important task for healthcare providers, families, and the patients themselves. Without the right technology, healthcare providers run the risk of diminishing the security and safety of their patients.  THE SOLUTION
SOLUTIONPatient TrackingSOLUTION With the latest RFID technology, patient tracking has become a sophisticated system that provides continuously accurate results. An RFID tag is affixed to the wristband of the patient to transmit data. Sensors throughout the facility then allow administrative personnel to see where the patient has been, and where they currently are. Additionally, sensors and transmitters can be formatted to lock doors to keep patients safe and secure. IS IT RIGHT FOR ME?

THE CHALLENGE




CHALLENGENurse Call SystemsCHALLENGEPatient health and satisfaction are a hospital’s top priorities. Nurses wait on a patient’s every need and simultaneously have to locate items such as wheelchairs and medicine. This lengthens the amount of time a patient waits for the needed item. THE SOLUTION
SOLUTIONNurse Call SystemsSOLUTION Nurse Call provides a solution with an asset-tracking feature called ELPAS. Specific items can be tracked, such as wheelchairs or medicine. Once the sensors are in place, they will track where the wheelchairs have been and for how long. Hospital personnel can then look on a digital map on a computer to see where the wheelchairs travelled and determine how many wheelchairs are needed on each floor. This type of information is exactly what a hospital needs to run smoothly and efficiently. IS IT RIGHT FOR ME?
IS IT RIGHT FOR ME?Nurse Call SystemsIS IT RIGHT FOR ME?
Nurse Call operates mainly with two specific tools: a bedside remote and a nurse pager. Both of these tools allow Nurse Call to accomplish its primary responsibility of assisting nurses in giving the best possible care to their patients. The bedside remote connects the patient to a nurse with the push of a button and the nurse’s pager keeps nurses connected to their patients, other nurses on the floor, and doctors in the hospital. Nurse Call is much more than a remote used to grab the attention of nurses. Nurse Call is a complete Health System.

Review by rta3569:

Jed did a very large addition to my home, and it was terrific from beginning to end.  Attention to detail, organized, and attentive; every time I had a question or concern, Jed had a reasonable answer.   I enjoyed working with Jed and all of his workers.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Carmel, IN professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Carmel, IN portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Carmel, IN professional for more information.

What is a general contractor?General, or construction contractors, are often known as project managers. They oversee the entire remodeling or new home construction project and facilitate all day-to-day tasks that move it toward completion. A Carmel general building contractor will work with your architect to review plan as you build a house and ensure everything is in place before work is started as well as arrange for permits and necessary inspections. While good local home improvement contractors in Carmel will have the skills to handle certain tasks onsite, such as carpentry, he or she is also responsible for hiring subcontractors for the majority of jobs, such as electrical work, painting or plumbing. In addition, the general contractor should be on-site regularly to inspect the progress and resolve issues. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of general contractors: Architects & Building Designers, Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Kitchen & Bath Designers, Specialty Contractors.Home remodeling contractors are a must for successful completion of a renovation. Because of this, it's essential that you do your homework before deciding on the right general contractor in Carmel as you remodel or build a house. Inspect bids carefully. Was it ready when the contractor promised it? Was the bid for building a home unusually high or low? Each of these things can be very telling: A late bid may reflect timing standards, and an off-the-mark bid could be code for a pricey premium or a deliberate underbid to score the remodeling job. You should call references, carefully read reviews and visit completed projects in Carmel, IN to see if they’re what you expect for your job. Once you do secure your local Carmel contractors, read the contract very carefully to be sure everyone is on the same page.Questions to ask prospective Carmel general contractors: How long have you been in the business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? What qualities do you look for in your subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Are you licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? What happens when costs exceed budget, whether due to materials or labor pricing changes? What about changes made by the client or by the professionals — what kinds of situations would cause those costs to be incurred? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can your job get done? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Carmel contractor on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to Carmel, IN home contractors. You can also search for photos in Carmel, IN and contact the Carmel general contractor who worked on the project. Professional Categories in Carmel
