Our Brand







Materials science is in our DNA.



The pursuit of our vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world.
























Heritage







The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan. Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry. With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison. Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain. In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.



















What We Do







Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.



















Global Markets







Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution. 

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

Reflective Solutions
We've been providing traffic safety solutions since 1924 when the innovative J.C. Stimson, who founded the company eventually acquired by Avery Dennison, began applying prismatic glass materials for use in road signs.

History[edit]




Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.


The company was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products, a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Stanton Avery. The name was changed to Avery Adhesives in 1937. In 1946, the company was incorporated as Avery Adhesive Label Corp., and the name was subsequently changed to Avery Adhesive Products, Inc. in 1958, and to Avery Products Corporation in 1964.[3] The name was changed again to Avery International Corporation in 1976, and it became Avery Dennison after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.[4]
Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.)
Office and Consumer Products[edit]
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals. Consumers, who often make purchasing decisions at the last minute, choose among vividly branded packages on the shelf, and Avery Dennison intends for its materials to enhance products’ “shelf appeal.”
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.
The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.
The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry. Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.[7]
Patent infringement[edit]
In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.

CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals. Consumers, who often make purchasing decisions at the last minute, choose among vividly branded packages on the shelf, and Avery Dennison intends for its materials to enhance products’ “shelf appeal.”
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.
The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.
The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry. Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.[7]
Patent infringement[edit]
In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.

History[edit]




Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.


The company was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products, a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Stanton Avery. The name was changed to Avery Adhesives in 1937. In 1946, the company was incorporated as Avery Adhesive Label Corp., and the name was subsequently changed to Avery Adhesive Products, Inc. in 1958, and to Avery Products Corporation in 1964.[3] The name was changed again to Avery International Corporation in 1976, and it became Avery Dennison after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.[4]
Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.)
Office and Consumer Products[edit]
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals.

Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick.

Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:

History[edit]




Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.


The company was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products, a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Stanton Avery. The name was changed to Avery Adhesives in 1937. In 1946, the company was incorporated as Avery Adhesive Label Corp., and the name was subsequently changed to Avery Adhesive Products, Inc. in 1958, and to Avery Products Corporation in 1964.[3] The name was changed again to Avery International Corporation in 1976, and it became Avery Dennison after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.[4]
Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.)
Office and Consumer Products[edit]
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals. Consumers, who often make purchasing decisions at the last minute, choose among vividly branded packages on the shelf, and Avery Dennison intends for its materials to enhance products’ “shelf appeal.”
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.
The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.
The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry. Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.[7]
Patent infringement[edit]
In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.

History[edit]




Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.


The company was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products, a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Stanton Avery. The name was changed to Avery Adhesives in 1937. In 1946, the company was incorporated as Avery Adhesive Label Corp., and the name was subsequently changed to Avery Adhesive Products, Inc. in 1958, and to Avery Products Corporation in 1964.[3] The name was changed again to Avery International Corporation in 1976, and it became Avery Dennison after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.[4]
Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.)
Office and Consumer Products[edit]
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals. Consumers, who often make purchasing decisions at the last minute, choose among vividly branded packages on the shelf, and Avery Dennison intends for its materials to enhance products’ “shelf appeal.”
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.
The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.
The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry. Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.[7]
Patent infringement[edit]
In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.

Avery Dennison headquarters in Glendale


Avery Dennison Corporation is a global manufacturer and distributor of pressure-sensitive adhesive materials (such as self-adhesive labels), apparel branding labels and tags, RFID inlays, and specialty medical products. The company is a member of the Fortune 500 and is headquartered in Glendale, California.

History[edit]




Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.


The company was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products, a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Stanton Avery. The name was changed to Avery Adhesives in 1937. In 1946, the company was incorporated as Avery Adhesive Label Corp., and the name was subsequently changed to Avery Adhesive Products, Inc. in 1958, and to Avery Products Corporation in 1964.[3] The name was changed again to Avery International Corporation in 1976, and it became Avery Dennison after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.[4]
Dennison Manufacturing[edit]
The Dennison Manufacturing Company was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son Aaron Lufkin Dennison, residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.)
Office and Consumer Products[edit]
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.
Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.0 billion.[5] Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and informations solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).[6] The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.[2] Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955.
Divisions[edit]
The company's operations are organized into three business units:
The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.
Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals. Consumers, who often make purchasing decisions at the last minute, choose among vividly branded packages on the shelf, and Avery Dennison intends for its materials to enhance products’ “shelf appeal.”
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.
The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.
The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry. Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.[7]
Patent infringement[edit]
In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
