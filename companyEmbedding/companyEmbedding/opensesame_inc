OpenSesame-HD 720p










What We Do


OpenSesame makes buying and selling elearning courses as easy as downloading a song from iTunes. Preview courses, read reviews and research sellers in our marketplace. Buy courses with no subscriptions or long-term commitments and use them instantly in any Learning Management System (LMS). Let us do the heavy lifting, so you can focus on choosing the best courses for your employees.












Why We Do It


We enjoy simplifying processes and making systems better. It’s what excites us and keeps us energized. While running an LMS for the trade industry, we were frustrated by the lack of compelling content and grueling sales process to gain access to courses. We recognized the innovative techniques being used in the digital media realm and realized a similar process could be used to empower businesses to create a custom course catalog for their employee development. Since our launch in July 2011, we’ve focused on building out our content with the goal to be the largest marketplace for online training courses.







































How we’re different.


We value transparency and simplicity in order to provide a fantastic customer experience. Buyers can personalize their interaction either through browsing our extensive listing of courses online or interacting with one of our content specialists to custom build their training catalog. Sellers can stick with the LMS they know best and can rest easy knowing their material is protected. At OpenSesame, we measure our success based on the ease and speed of your experience.

 | 
27
July
2017






Creating killer course content is only half of the battle when it comes to designing an eLearning course. You also need to present your content in a way that addresses the key tenets of user experience: aesthetics, usability, accessibility, performance and levels of human interaction.
Establishing a good user experience means your course is much more likely to yield positive student experiences and excellent business results for your clients. So how do you go about creating the best possible user experience for your eLearning course?

        By             Brenda Savoie

July
2017






You had a great idea. You worked tirelessly to choose an eLearning course that would help your team grow. You made sure to provide enough materials, test their skills, and create a feedback system that works. Now what? Your course is ready to face the competition. It won’t be easy. There are dozens of courses to choose from, regardless of the topic the learner has in mind. Why should your employees be interested in this particular course?
Even if these are your employees and you can easily make the course mandatory, you don’t want to do that. ...           [more]

Having Problems with your eLearning Courses Using Adobe Flash?






        By             Elias Jackson



 | 
19
July
2017






As web technology continues to grow and evolve, internet browsers are constantly adapting to ensure full compatibility. Adobe Flash, a browser plugin that delivers content such as videos and interactive elements, is being phased out by the industry and replaced by HTML5, a more modern way to view this same content without requiring the use of a plugin. As internet browsers are beginning to disable Flash, more and more elearning providers such as OpenSesame and many of our course publishers, are transitioning to HTML5 over time. ...

How to Equip Sales Reps With the Necessary Business Skills to Land C-Level Buyers 






        By             Erin Satterthwaite



 | 
18
July
2017






Unfortunately, all too often sales representatives rarely achieve those desired C-level sales. A recent Forbes article explains, “eight out of 10 executive buyers consider the sales meetings they take to be a waste of time” and believe that representatives do not demonstrate an adequate knowledge of their buyers business. Perhaps this is not purely the inherent shortcoming of the sales representative, but an indication of a more insidious issue of sales reps not being adequately trained with the business skills to successfully seize these c-level sale opportunities.
 
The Solution? ...           [more]

Frequently Asked Questions - (FAQ)

FAAC Specific


Q: Why does one gate leaf run slower than the
            other?
            A: The operator might need to be bled. Remember to remove the vent
            screw and run the operator (electronically) a couple of times. Also
            make sure the potentiometers are set to their appropriate settings
            and that the torque is set to the maximum setting for hydraulics.
            Lastly, check the oil level and make sure it�s at the proper
            operating level, as explained in the Installation Manual.


Q: Why won�t my operator run at all?
            A: Make sure that the correct circuits are closed. This entails
            possibly adding jumper circuits. Check your manual for correct
            placement. Also, for existing installations, be sure to check your
            fuses and LED.


Q: How do I know if my pressures are correct?
            A: Remember that hydraulic pressures are not set at the factory. The
            pressures must be set so that if the gate meets an obstacle, it will
            bypass at 33 pounds of pressure. This may seem right for your
            installation, but the pressures still need to be checked and
            adjusted for your particular application.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/26/2011
            

                BBB has determined that OpenSesame Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Its online training platform, directly connects content providers with employees and businesses for online training resources and specially designed courses for professionals, which can be accessed through a Learning management system.[1][2][3] The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Portland, Oregon. As of January 2016, OpenSesame tracks around 20,000 courses from more than 300 vendors.[4]

History[edit]
The idea to start OpenSesame came to the founders Don Spear, Joshua Blank, Aaron Bridges and Tom Turnbull in 2011.[5] They founded the company on the idea to aggregate fragmented elearning content from reputable publishers and resources including FranklinCovey, Cegos and Wiley through a Learning Management System (LMS).[6][7][8] They worked on creating an ecommerce platform where any seller can add courses for sale and any buyer can purchase courses for use in their company's learning and development program.[9] They went through the Portland State University Business Accelerator and after conducting a few pilot trials, OpenSesame received seed funding of $2 million from Harmony Investments on October 2011.[10][11] The company soon gained some major clients including satellite TV giant Dish Network, SilkRoad Technology, Five Guys Burgers and Fries. In January 2014 the company raised another round of Series A funding of $10 million led by Partech Ventures to create a corporate content delivery platform modeled after iTunes.[12][13][14] The marketplace allows the seller to set the price of the content, with a share in the profits for distributing through OpenSesame’s marketplace. On July 22, 2014 OpenSesame was granted US Patent Number US 8784113 B2 for their “Open and Interactive e-Learning System and Method.”[15]
Development[edit]
Since 2011, the OpenSesame development team has been focusing on the content and the development of features in line with the businesses' needs. The main concern of the company is not to build up a large number of new features on its marketplace, but to concentrate upon a few elaborated tools that can integrate with the various LMS’.[16][17]
Use[edit]
OpenSesame is used in continuing professional development for employees and professionals via courses obtained online. Its platform allows companies to buy courses created by industry experts instead of having to create their own.[18] It allows businesses to search for courses offered by its sellers, they can preview the content, read reviews and know about the content seller.[19][20][21]
Accessibility[edit]
OpenSesame is the first marketplace to comply completely with the accessibility specifications of Sharable Content Object Reference Model.[22][23] The content is also designed for adaptability to any of several teaching and learning scenarios with a variety of authoring tools compatible to any learning management system and custom business tools.

History[edit]
The idea to start OpenSesame came to the founders Don Spear, Joshua Blank, Aaron Bridges and Tom Turnbull in 2011.[5] They founded the company on the idea to aggregate fragmented elearning content from reputable publishers and resources including FranklinCovey, Cegos and Wiley through a Learning Management System (LMS).[6][7][8] They worked on creating an ecommerce platform where any seller can add courses for sale and any buyer can purchase courses for use in their company's learning and development program.[9] They went through the Portland State University Business Accelerator and after conducting a few pilot trials, OpenSesame received seed funding of $2 million from Harmony Investments on October 2011.[10][11] The company soon gained some major clients including satellite TV giant Dish Network, SilkRoad Technology, Five Guys Burgers and Fries. In January 2014 the company raised another round of Series A funding of $10 million led by Partech Ventures to create a corporate content delivery platform modeled after iTunes.[12][13][14] The marketplace allows the seller to set the price of the content, with a share in the profits for distributing through OpenSesame’s marketplace. On July 22, 2014 OpenSesame was granted US Patent Number US 8784113 B2 for their “Open and Interactive e-Learning System and Method.”[15]
Development[edit]
Since 2011, the OpenSesame development team has been focusing on the content and the development of features in line with the businesses' needs. The main concern of the company is not to build up a large number of new features on its marketplace, but to concentrate upon a few elaborated tools that can integrate with the various LMS’.[16][17]
Use[edit]
OpenSesame is used in continuing professional development for employees and professionals via courses obtained online. Its platform allows companies to buy courses created by industry experts instead of having to create their own.[18] It allows businesses to search for courses offered by its sellers, they can preview the content, read reviews and know about the content seller.[19][20][21]
Accessibility[edit]
OpenSesame is the first marketplace to comply completely with the accessibility specifications of Sharable Content Object Reference Model.[22][23] The content is also designed for adaptability to any of several teaching and learning scenarios with a variety of authoring tools compatible to any learning management system and custom business tools.
