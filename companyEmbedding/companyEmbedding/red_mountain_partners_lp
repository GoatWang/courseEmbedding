	Companies that don't have any trademark applications are more likely to be stable, maintaining their existing business lines.
	Companies that are applying for new trademarks are likely to be investing in R&D and marketing, attempting to expand more rapidly or pivoting to reach strategic markets.
	Trademarks may include brand names, product names, logos and slogans.

Red Mountain Urges iRobot To Explore Strategic Alternatives Including Sale
Dec 1 15
In a letter to Colin Angle, the Chairman and Chief Executive Office of iRobot Corporation (NasdaqGS:IRBT), Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC suggested iRobot to explore strategic alternatives for the defense and security business, discontinue the remote presence business, focus on the high- growth Home Robots business and the consumer end-market, allocate capital with discipline and an intense focus on risk-adjusted returns and address significant lapses in corporate governance. In addition, Red Mountain said that the Board should consider all other paths to maximize shareholder value, including a sale of iRobot as an alternative to the implementation of the proposed value enhancement plan.
