Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...





Home Values & Sold Home Prices

Ever wonder, "how much is my house worth?" Search by state, city, zip code, or address to find homes recently sold in your neighborhood. Home values are calculated from sold prices, public records of assessed value, and area real estate information. While these estimates can help planning a real estate purchase or sale, you should always consult with a real estate agent or house appraisal specialist. Need more help? We can also assist when searching for homes for sale, homes for rent, or with finding the best mortgage rates.

People, parks, and pumas…and prionsProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2005Author(s): Hunter, DSuggested Citation: Hunter, D. 2005. People, parks, and pumas…and prions. 01/01/1901The puma, or mountain lion, ranks as Colorado’s top predator and one of Rocky Mountain National Park’s most charismatic species. For more than a decade park managers have wanted to conduct research on this elusive animal: How many of these big cats live in the park? What do they eat? Is the population stable or declining? Is the park a source of cat immigration into nearby Boulder County? Are there safety concerns that aren’t being addressed? And recently, the question arose to whether these big cats prefer deer that are infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD), a deadly disease spread by malformed proteins called prions. That is, do mountain lions selectively prey on infected deer and act as a natural control to the spread of the disease, a behavior that would support the old theories of natural selection. These are but a few of the questions that will be answered over the coming years as researchers, led by the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW) and USGS-Fort Collins Science Center (FORT), begin to reveal the ecological story of the Park’s most impressive and least understood resident...
