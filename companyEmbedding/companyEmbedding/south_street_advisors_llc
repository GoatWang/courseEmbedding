The firm's structure enables us to react rapidly to changing market conditions and client requests. South Street is recognized in the marketplace for delivering superior and consistent long-term investment results, and for adjusting asset allocation levels in client portfolios during periods of volatile or unsettled markets. Clients of South Street benefit from the experience of the firm's principals, each of whom has worked for more than 30 years managing investment portfolios. A critical distinguishing feature of the firm is the direct access our clients have to these experienced executives, the owners of the business. At South Street, we advocate liquidity and transparency in our investments, and marry those tenets with a solid personal long-term relationship with our clients. The combination has resulted in a high level of client retention at the firm. Our flexible structure allows us to work with virtually any custodian bank around the world. Being independent, however, results in our representing only the interests of our clients.

Investment Approach — South Street Advisors LLC





















































THE SOUTH STREET INVESTMENT APPROACH







South Street Advisors employs an integrated investment approach driven by the firm's single-minded goal of achieving each client's rate of return objective at an appropriate level of risk. Portfolios are tailored to the client's financial requirements, rather than according to a predetermined investment policy. We believe our clients' return objectives can only be met by applying a consistent and disciplined approach to all phases of the investment process. The process is applied to the analysis of individual securities, and the strategic adjustment of asset allocation levels to current market conditions for common stocks, bonds and alternative investments. Our principals have developed an integrated process that projects returns over the same time horizon for each asset class. The process establishes specific risk parameters which must be met before an investment is made. We apply the same approach to individual securities, evaluating each company's financial metrics against peer group averages for equities, bonds and alternative investments. This approach enables South Street to adapt quickly to changing market circumstances, while at the same time balancing each client's return objective with his/her risk profile.

Philosophy — South Street Advisors LLC





















































THE SOUTH STREET PHILOSOPHY







South Street Advisors believes a focus on absolute rates of return and customer service are the cornerstones of successful investment management.  We maintain an investor's primary objective should be wealth creation. In our view, this is best achieved by actively managing a portfolio's exposure to high quality fixed-income securities and publicly traded shares of well-capitalized corporations. We seek to invest in companies with superior long-term growth prospects and leading positions in their industries. We identify value by evaluating a company's financial position and business condition from a long-term perspective. By adopting such an approach, South Street seeks to identify under-recognized return potential without assuming undue financial risk. We believe effective investment managers adapt to changing markets, provide custom-tailored advice and solutions, and make themselves available to clients at all times.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
