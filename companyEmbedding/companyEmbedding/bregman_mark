Mission Statement
BOYLE OGATA BREGMAN IS BRINGING LEADERS TO SMART COMPANIES.TM
Our mission is to provide the highest quality executive search services,  as well as high-value Human  Capital Optimization consulting, to ensure that our clients benefit  from the new executives we bring and the solid players already on  board.
BOYLE OGATA BREGMAN utilizes a unique process known as  The Performance-Based  Search System to ensure that our clients can hire outstanding  individuals for senior management positions, individuals that make a  positive contribution to the company’s bottom line profitability.
History
The J. Michael Group was formed by J. Michael Boyle and Keith Ogata in  1979. The firm name was changed to BOYLE OGATA in 1996.
Strong in aerospace from its inception, in the early years the firm did a  substantial amount of placement for Northrop, involving management  level and executive positions for the massive hiring plan to staff the  B-2 Stealth Bomber program.
As the aerospace prime industry began to shift, the founders expanded  into other types of aerospace and industrial companies and  entrepreneurial start-ups, especially those funded by venture capital  and private equity. This broad base of business enabled the company to  present itself as a “Generalist,” but with specific expertise in certain  areas. In 1994, Mark Bregman joined the firm, and the company  transformed into a retained search firm focusing on high level  management positions. With the introduction of The Performance-Based  Search System in 1995, the company began to utilize a unique process  that addresses every aspect of a client’s hiring program, from the  initial identification of a potential need to hire, through development  of the Performance-Based Position Profile, to evaluation of candidates,  hiring, providing the new executive’s business plan for the first year,  and the criteria for evaluating their performance at the end of that  year.
In 2001, the partners decided to rename the company BOYLE OGATA  BREGMAN.
Client response to The Performance-Based Search System has been 100%  favorable, and BOYLE OGATA BREGMAN now attributes 75%  of its business to repeat and referral clients.
The firm continues its strong focus on aerospace, with significant  expertise in industrial, manufacturing, distribution, consumer products,  and more. See our Completed Search page for more details. We fill key  management positions in all functional disciplines, including  operations, sales & marketing, finance, engineering, quality, supply  chain, etc.
We look forward to working with you!

Our passion for performance extends to our approach to Talent  Management. Our focus on defining specific objectives for each key  individual on your team, and evaluating people based on their capability  to deliver those results.  This approach can be used in Organizational  Design, Management Assessment, Workforce Planning, Talent Acquisition  Strategies, and more.  We can also train your Talent Acquisition and  Recruiting Team, as well as your Hiring Managers, in how to implement  our Performance-Based approach so you can achieve better hires more  quickly.
We have innovative new solutions that include:
Strategic Workforce Planning – we can provide a performance-based  overlay to SWP that provides practical tools to speed and enhance your  talent acquisition planning and strategy.
Talent Acquisition Planning – What do you need accomplished?   When?  Who will do it?  Where are they now?  Why will they work for  you?  How will you find and attract them?  Whether your issue is  acquiring new talent, developing current team members, redeployment of  people, or using temporary solutions – our approach will help you make  the best decision and hit the target accurately every time.
Every Talent Management project is custom designed to help your Human  Capital Optimization. Most executive search firms have no  capability beyond recruitment.  We’ve been adding value to our clients’  talent management processes for over 10 years.


Our clients want access to the best candidates, even when they want to recruit on their own. This must include the “A” players that are now productive and satisfied (the so-called “passive” job seekers), who might be open to exploring a new opportunity. Boyle Ogata Bregman provides expert consulting in candidate sourcing to help employers find these top performers. This typically includes the following:

 Industry and Company Identification: Collaboration with employer to define key industry segments and specific companies from which the employer wants to see candidates.
Sourcing Road Map: Specific techniques that your recruiting team can use to identify and harvest ideal candidates.
Communications Campaign: We draft specific electronic communications, telephone scripts and other tools to ensure that your team will be completely effective in reaching and connecting with targeted prospects.
Advertising: Our ads are 6-10 times more effective* at attracting candidates, increasing your yield on any job posting.
Training: We will train your recruitment team in “Headhunting 201sm” – how to recruit like a PRO.
Direct Recruitment: For clients without their own recruiting team, we can implement the strategic sourcing plan, monitor, track, report, and dramatically improve your results.

* Based on independent analysis by Career Builder job board


For executives in transition, or for those who are currently employed  but wish to leverage their capability into a more rewarding career  position, Boyle Ogata Bregman offers executive career marketing and  development consulting. Each program is custom designed for your unique  needs, and typically includes:

Assessment of Transferable Skills: Defining the specific value you will add to your next employer. Identify Prospective…
Employers: Use precision targeting to identify the employers who align with your goals and can best utilize your talents.
Communications Tools: Most candidate inquiries, through every means of communication, fail. Let us show you how to get in the door, with specific letters, e-mails, resume format, and telephone scripts that will work for you.
Networking: Most executive positions really are not advertised, but created based on opportune connections. We’ll show you how to mount a successful networking campaign that has your friends (and even strangers) opening doors for you. Be part of the 5% of job seekers who know how to use this channel successfully.
Interviewing: Don’t get de-selected before you have a real chance. Know how to establish excellent rapport, subtly lead an interview, tell your story in a compelling manner, and make a favorable impression, every time.
Deal-Making: When and how to discuss terms to elicit a great offer that you will want to accept.



What is your ROI on compensation? Is your compensation plan designed to produce specific tangible results? Boyle Ogata Bregman can help you implement a Performance-Based Compensation Program that dramatically enhances performance of your key management team, and even improves the performance of your rank and file employees. Our compensation projects can include:

 Surveys: Find out what your competitors are doing, even in privately held companies. We conduct custom surveys designed to capture critical data that will enable you to adjust to your market and compete for top talent, without over-spending on personnel.
Incentive Compensation Planning: We will show you how to tie your evaluation process seamlessly into compensation. We design bonus plans that reward people for their specific ability to enhance your bottom line. Your key employees will like this form of compensation planning so much, it virtually guarantees improved retention, and ensures that you only pay for value received. See our sample MBO –  Performance Based Compensation Plan.



Utilize our expert coaching for yourself, or for one of your key  executive reports that might need a “tune up.”
Using a results-oriented approach, we help executives to focus on  priorities, set goals, and create an action plan for success that aligns  with a balanced life. Coaching can be oriented toward greater  effectiveness on the job, a career change, stress reduction, or your  most critical issues.
We will find out what is really important to YOU, what resources you  already have, what challenges you face, what actions you need to take,  and what are the specific, tangible outcomes you desire.
Client coaching relationships start with an in-depth initial  conversation to define your needs, set goals, and determine how we will  proceed. Weekly or semi-weekly conversations and e-mail as needed will  help you to consistently take action (and refine and adjust that action)  to meet goals, and to STAY ON TRACK!
Clients have found that our coaching has helped them to focus on  results, become congruent in their actions, make better decisions, make  improvements in productivity and quality of relationships, and in some  cases, turn their lives around. We’ve also been instrumental in helping  people leverage their careers and obtain better positions.


Consistent achievement of aggressive growth goals and other critical company objectives depends upon having solid leaders who are uniquely suited to the role they play, and who are capable of producing the essential results. We ensure that our clients can maximize productivity and profitability and optimize the results from executives in key positions. Assessment projects typically include:

PERFORMANCE NEEDS OF COMPANY AND POSITION: Define the company’s critical goals, along with the specific, tangible results needed from each key individual. Develop performance measurement criteria to determine success. Discover the values and beliefs the successful candidate must possess to succeed in producing the desired outcomes, and to fit in the company’s culture. Create a performance-based position profile that defines the above issues for each critical management role.
ASSESS KEY LEADERS ACCORDING TO POSITION PROFILE: Determine each incumbent’s ability to produce the essential results. Determine if the incumbent’s character and personality traits align with the demands of the position, and are well suited to interaction with other executives. Examine goals, priorities, motivation, work style, etc. to find areas of congruence or disagreement with the company’s current and future needs.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION: Provide senior management with specific advice, upon which decisions can be made about each key leader’s potential. Furnish specific strategies on how to maximize the effectiveness of key individuals. Advise management on organizational changes and adjustments that would prove beneficial to the company.

Keeping an ineffective individual in a key position can be costly, perhaps fatal to the efforts of a growing company. Using the PERFORMANCE-BASED MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT to determine a key manager’s ability to produce essential results ensures that company owners will achieve their goals in a competitive market.


Organizational consulting custom designed to reflect your needs and goals, and to achieve specific results. Our projects typically include:

 Understanding Corporate Goals: Defining and clarifying specific, tangible, measurable goals for the company, and the level of alignment and understanding of current goals within the management team.
Functional Process Definition / Process Improvements: Defining how key executive work is actually performed at the company, with recommendations for improvements or changes.
Organization Charts: Recommending alternative organizational arrangements, with a rationale explaining the reasoning for each configuration.
Position Specifications: Defining the performance objectives, performance evaluation criteria, and other qualifying factors for each key position on the team. These position specifications will serve you as business plans for each key employee.
Evaluations: Evaluation of the people in key management positions, with our opinion as to how well each person is qualified to meet the company’s goals, and recommendations for further action.
Observations & Recommendations: Our organizational consulting projects always enable us to provide critical insights to senior management about how their businesses can run more efficiently and productively. We include these recommendations at no extra cost.



Headhunting 201SM (not 101 – because we know you aren’t an  amateur) teaches your in-house recruitment team to do executive search  like a PRO. We train our clients so well, many of them no longer need us  to do search – they can do it themselves! Our training program  typically includes:

Avoiding Mistakes:  An overview of the most common recruiting errors – and how to use a best practices approach to recruitment.
Performance-Based Search System: In-depth review of our process, and why it works at each step. Sourcing: The “Active” recruiter can find the “passive” candidate – the top performer who is happy, productive, and NOT looking for a new job.
Evaluation: The critical screening and evaluation techniques that will predict success.
Closing: How to construct the right offer, and gain acceptance every time.
On-Boarding: How to facilitate the inbound transition to ensure a fast track to performance, and excellent retention.
Strategic Partner: How the recruiter can add value to every transaction and be an excellent internal resource to the employer.

 News Room





Jul 28, 2011

	 

	Sterling, VA – Neustar, Inc. (NYSE: NSR), a provider of market-leading innovative solutions and directory services, announced today that Mark F. Bregman will join the company as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), effective August 2.  Dr. Bregman comes to Neustar from Symantec Corporation, where he has served since 2006 as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. He will be responsible for Neustar’s product technology strategy and product development efforts.   The appointment was announced by Lisa Hook, President and CEO of Neustar, to whom Dr. Bregman will report.  He will be based in Neustar’s office  in Mountain View, California.

	“I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Mark Bregman as our new CTO.  As the world’s leading provider of network addressing, routing and policy management, Neustar is an attractive destination for today’s top technology talent,” said Ms. Hook.  “As Neustar continues to provide these critical services, along with cyber security and data analytics, to network operators, Internet companies, and media companies, having a CTO with Mark’s breadth of experience is a tremendous asset.”

	Dr. Bregman’s portfolio while CTO of Symantec Corporation included developing the company’s technology strategy and overseeing its investments in advanced research and development, security and technology services.  Prior to Symantec, Dr. Bregman serviced as Executive Vice President, Product Operations at Veritas Corporation, which merged with Symantec in 2005.  Prior to Veritas, he was CEO of AirMedia, an early mobile content marketplace, and spent 16 years in a variety of roles at IBM.  Dr. Bregman was awarded a Ph.D. in Physics from Columbia University in 1984.  He is a graduate of Harvard College.

	“What excites me most about coming to Neustar is the opportunity to work for a company that demonstrates  top-flight technology innovation across multiple platforms,” said Dr. Bregman.  “Joining the company when it is building on its number portability and Internet infrastructure services by  creating cloud-based digital rights management systems, rolling out advanced cyber-security services  for both the government and private sector, and offering enterprises new data and analytics tools, offers me an opportunity to help drive Neustar’s business success in multiple arenas.”

	Dr. Bregman’s appointment builds on momentum Neustar created with other recent high-level hires from the technology world, including Scott Blake Harris, Neustar’s Executive Vice President, Legal and External Affairs, who previously served as General Counsel of the United States Department of Energy; and Scott Deutchman, Neustar’s Vice President, Legal and External Affairs, who previously served as the Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Telecommunications for the Executive Office of the President’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Data Center Virtualization: Digging Deeper



December 12, 2007


Add Comment




Data centers are the vaults where we store mission critical information and intellectual property that users may need to access on quick notice but which also need to be protected. What does it take to successfully ‘virtualize’ a data center? Is it a smooth ride? If not, what issues need to be addressed?

(more...)To receive property from someone who has died. Traditionally, the word 'inherit' applied only when one received property from a relative who died without a will. Currently, however, the word is used whenever someone receives property from the estate of a deceased person.

HEIR AT LAWA person entitled to inherit property under intestate succession laws.

ESTATE TAXESTaxes imposed by the state or federal government on property as it passes from the dead to the living. All property you own, whatever the form of ownership, and... (more...)Taxes imposed by the state or federal government on property as it passes from the dead to the living. All property you own, whatever the form of ownership, and whether or not it goes through probate after your death, is subject to federal estate tax. Currently, however, federal estate tax is due only if your property is worth at least $2 million when you die. The estate tax is scheduled to be repealed for one year, in 2010, but Congress will probably make the repeal (or a very high exempt amount) permanent. Any property left to a surviving spouse (if he or she is a U.S. citizen) or a tax-exempt charity is exempt from federal estate taxes. Many states now also impose their own estate taxes or inheritance taxes.

EXECUTORThe person named in a will to handle the property of someone who has died. The executor collects the property, pays debts and taxes, and then distributes what's... (more...)The person named in a will to handle the property of someone who has died. The executor collects the property, pays debts and taxes, and then distributes what's left, as specified in the will. The executor also handles any probate court proceedings and notifies people and organizations of the death. Also called personal representatives.

HOLOGRAPHIC WILLA will that is completely handwritten, dated and signed by the person making it. Holographic wills are generally not witnessed. Although it's legal in many stat... (more...)A will that is completely handwritten, dated and signed by the person making it. Holographic wills are generally not witnessed. Although it's legal in many states, making a holographic will is never advised except as a last resort.

INTER VIVOS TRUSTThe Latin name, favored by some lawyers, for a living trust. 'Inter vivos' is Latin for 'between the living.'

PROPERTY CONTROL TRUSTAny trust that imposes limits or controls over the rights of trust beneficiaries. These trusts include (1) special needs trusts designed to assist people who ha... (more...)Any trust that imposes limits or controls over the rights of trust beneficiaries. These trusts include (1) special needs trusts designed to assist people who have special physical, emotional or other requirements, (2) spendthrift trusts designed to prevent a beneficiary from wasting the trust principal; and (3) sprinkling trusts that allow the trustee to decide how to distribute trust income or principal among the beneficiaries.

FAILURE OF ISSUEA situation in which a person dies without children who could have inherited her property.

(more...)The most common method of financing real estate purchases in California (most other states use mortgages). The trust deed transfers the title to the property to a trustee -- often a title company -- who holds it as security for a loan. When the loan is paid off, the title is transferred to the borrower. The trustee will not become involved in the arrangement unless the borrower defaults on the loan. At that point, the trustee can sell the property and pay the lender from the proceeds.

Consulted attorney
Purchased an Avvo serviceInheritance5.0 starsPosted by Shirley March 15, 2016I found Mark through a third party. He helped me get an inheritance that my father had left me. He worked hard to get me a settlement from my brother that thought he should have had it all..it took awhile ,but in the end I got what I asked for. I highly recommend Mark to anyone needing a good lawyer.More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney Careful and detail-oriented5.0 starsPosted by Dana February  6, 2016Mark was a pleasure to work with; he dealt with both the unusual and the mundane aspects of our estate planning issues and documents professionally, and answered all questions completely and promptly.  His staff also is excellent.More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney A caring attorney you can trust.  5.0 starsPosted by Brenda October 11, 2015Mark made himself available when we needed to update my father's trust and other estate documents. He answered questions and worked efficiently. Mark really went the extra mile. More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney Satisfied client5.0 starsPosted by anonymous October  3, 2015Mark was very thorough and made our estate planning comfortable. I anticipated it to be a difficult and sensitive topic.  He took a lot of time with us and answered all of our questions.More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney Special Needs Trust5.0 starsPosted by anonymous April 28, 2015We have a handicapped son and Mr. Bergman was able to help us complete an Estate Plan which include a Special Needs Trust.   His knowledge and expertise really helped simplify to whole process.   From our first visit to our last Mr. Bergman and his staff went above and beyond to ensure we had the information and the materials needed, to make sure our son will continue to get the services and support he needs to thrive.More Excellent Service, Excellent Product5.0 starsPosted by Michael April 13, 2015The entire process of creating Wills, a Trust , Living Wills and Powers of Attorney for my wife and myself  was handled in an extremely organized fashion and efficiently. We appreciated the team approach with each person in the office, fulfilling their roles very competently. I have already made one referral for similar services and will continue to do so.More Thank You Mark for "Peace of Mind"5.0 starsPosted by Laura April  1, 2015April 1st, 2015
To whom it may concern: I am writing this letter really to thank Mark Bregman our Estate Attorney who made the large task of setting up a Trust for my husband and myself a manageable job. The process was really quite painless as I write with a smile. My husband and I are 2nd time marriages. This always brings some sticky issues. Mark was able with a patient smile and wise years, help us reach some difficult decisions. He was able to speak to both of us in a manner that was clear and sensitive to many issues. Mark and Kim were always available to answer questions and always followed up. We feel a sense of security knowing Mark, and trust his judgement. He created a complete package along with “cloud” connections! “Have trust will travel!” ;-).... Thank you so much Mark! Wasnʼt sure we needed a trust but now the peace of mind it provides is well worth it!
Take care, LauraMore Review and prep of trust5.0 starsPosted by anonymous June  2, 2014I found that my association with Mark and his assistants was personal, professional, thorough, and I felt that they all were careful to be accurate and available.More Creating a Trust with Mark Bregman5.0 starsPosted by Ken June  1, 2014Mark spoke to us personally for over an hour ensuring we were completely comfortable with the process.  Once we all agreed he and his staff went to work immediately and covered every base I could think of.  During this process Mark and his staff were available to us via phone and internet at all times.  The end product is above reproach and I would highly recommend Mark and his staff.More Disputed estate representation5.0 starsPosted by Tom June  1, 2014I orignally found Mark through a trusted third party recommendation.  Mark isn't a pillage and burn type of  attorney.  Although he can be quite aggressive when he needs to be, it seems his preferred approach is to patiently guide his clients through the legal process, informing them of their options at each stage of the game, offering his sage advice when requested, and most importantly keeping them well informed at all times.  But perhaps Mark's best trait is that he maintains his sense of humor and good nature in the face of the opposing party's intentional attempts to provoke, always responding thoughtfully.  Mark guided me through a disputed estate process successfully with a close eye on my return on my expenses.  Overall, I would hire him again without any hesitation.More Write a review for Mark BregmanSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave

They represent clients both to the court and to opposing parties. Lawyers can represent clients in criminal cases, where a law has been broken, and in civil cases, in which one party is suing another.Lawyers are also important partners in situations that don’t involve the courtroom, advising clients about their legal rights and obligations for personal or business issues. They are trained to interpret complicated systems of laws and navigate the court system.What can a lawyer do for me?First, a lawyer will advise you as to whether or not you actually need legal help. It’s not always obvious whether an issue is a legal matter or something that can be resolved without involving the court system. A lawyer will help you answer these initial questions.Once you’ve decided to hire a lawyer, then they have the power to represent you to the court and to opposing parties. Your lawyer is your most important ally in any legal matter. They provide advice on how to proceed with your legal issue, and prepare important documents for you.If your issue involves going to court, your lawyer will accompany you, and can speak for you. If your legal matter involves mediation or arbitration, your lawyer will negotiate with the opposing party on your behalf.Let's find your lawyerWhat type of lawyer do I need?What practice area should I choose?Many lawyers tend to focus only on one area, or several related areas of law. In your search for the right lawyer, you should look for a lawyer who understands and has experience in the specific area of law for your issue. For example, a divorce lawyer may not be able to help you if you are considering declaring bankruptcy for your business, but a bankruptcy lawyer who understands bankruptcy and business law would be a perfect match. Reputable lawyers will be upfront about their experience and specific focus, but it will save you some time by narrowing your search beforehand.Top 5 practice areas for Avvo  attorneysAvvo attorneys handle cases in over 120 practice areas, including divorce, criminal defense, and bankruptcy.Find the practice area that fits your issueIs practice size and type something I should consider when I’m looking for a lawyer?Practice size is definitely something you should take into account. Some firms consist of only one lawyer, while some firms retain hundreds. There are many different types of law firms, some of which focus on very specific issues, while others may be more general. For instance, a large corporate firm may not help if you only need a lawyer to review a contract or a few documents, but may be the right choice if you are filing a personal injury suit against a large company. If your legal issue involves only small sums of money, or a few documents, a small firm may be more cost-effective. The size of a practice may also determine how quickly you will be able to actually speak to your potential lawyer; larger offices may require you to schedule your initial consultation through a lawyer’s assistant or secretary.Number of Avvo attorneys who offer free consultations25,654Let's find your lawyerHow do I narrow the list of possible lawyers to contact?Should location be a major factor in my search for a lawyer?Location is an important factor in looking for a lawyer to represent you. Since your issue will likely depend on state or local laws and regulations, you will want an attorney who understands the regulations for your location. On the practical side, you will also want a lawyer who has an office that is convenient for you to travel to. Some lawyers are willing to travel to meet you, but may also charge for travel time. It’s usually a good idea to find a lawyer located in your geographical area. Besides legal knowledge of state and local laws, lawyers also have practical local knowledge. Lawyers in specific cities or towns will also have connections to helpful agencies in that city, which will expedite the process of resolving your issue.What are other clients saying about them?One of the best ways to know if an attorney is right for you are reviews. Read what previous clients have said about specific attorneys and their experiences. Once you choose an attorney to contact, read all the reviews about that particular lawyer to get an idea of how they may handle your case and interact with you.Let's find your lawyerWhat fees and costs should I expect?What types of payment do lawyers usually accept?Most lawyers accept standard payment methods, such as cash, check, and credit cards. Sometimes the method of payment will involve part of the amount of a settlement, so be sure to discuss payment options with your lawyer before signing a fee agreement. Most lawyers are also willing to set up a payment plan, if necessary.The minimum rate for most attorneys is $149 per hourWhat is a fee agreement?A fee agreement, or representation agreement, is a payment agreement between a lawyer and a client. It can consist of several pages, or simply one page outlining the agreement. This document covers key issues such as how much you will be expected to pay for services rendered, how the lawyer will be paid, the timeline of payment, and which lawyer (if a multi-lawyer firm) will work on the case. Be sure to read the fee agreement carefully before signing it, so you know exactly what is expected of you and your lawyer.Common payments accepted by Avvo attorneysGlossary of common costs when hiring a lawyerConsultation Fee: A lawyer may charge for you first consultation meeting, but be sure you know the charges before you hire a lawyer. Ask about Consultation fees before you make an appointment, and how the fee is calculated (i.e. by the hour, half-hour, or otherwise).Contingency Fees: A contingency fee means that your lawyer only gets paid this fee if there is a favorable result in your case—a court win or a settlement in your favor. Typically, but not always, these fees consist of around 1/3 of the total settlement or judgment.Flat Fees: A flat fee means that the lawyer charges one price for each consultation, or for an entire case, no matter how much time or work it takes. Be sure to ask other lawyers for comparable rates if offered a flat fee.Hourly Rate: Lawyers often charge an agreed-upon hourly rate for their work, and the work of their assistants. The hourly rate applies to both face-to-face consultations and behind-the-scenes work on your case. A good lawyer will usually be able to estimate the required number of hours per case in advance.Retainer Fee: A retainer fee is an advance payment to an attorney towards the hourly rate in a specific case. Your attorney will place the retainer fee into an account, and deduct money as work on your case progresses. These are usually non-refundable if you choose to terminate the case early.Statutory Fee: Sometimes, state or local law determines a set amount that you owe your attorney for certain services, like bankruptcy cases and probate issues. A court may also set a statutory fee, though this isn’t standard.Court Costs: Be sure that you know whether, and how much, you will owe in court costs for your legal issue. A good lawyer will be able to estimate court costs in a given situation, and whether or not you will be able to obtain court costs from an opposing party in a favorable settlement or judgment.Filing Fees: Courts charge money for people to be able to file lawsuits and other court actions, like divorce and bankruptcy. Ask your potential lawyer to explain these fees before you sign a fee agreement.Secretarial Time: Lawyers charge different hourly rates for their own work and the work of their secretaries and paralegals. Be sure to ask about the difference before you decide to hire a lawyer and sign a fee agreement.Delivery Fees: In some cases, lawyers use courier services to deliver legal documents to opposing parties and to the court. Ask about potential delivery fees before you sign a fee agreement.Let's find your lawyerWhat questions should I ask before I hire a lawyer?What percentage of their cases deal with issues like mine?This is an important question that a reputable attorney should have no problem answering. You want to find a lawyer that has experience dealing with your specific issue, and this question will help you determine whether a lawyer is right for you. Feel free to ask for specific statistics, and for their average verdict/settlement numbers in cases similar to yours.How much experience does this lawyer have? What is their record?Lawyers, like all professionals, will have varying degrees of experience. Understanding a lawyer’s previous experience is essential to understanding how they can handle your case. You’ll want to ask how many years the lawyer has been practicing. A lack of experience doesn’t necessarily make for a bad lawyer, though, especially if they have experienced lawyers around them. This is why you’ll want to ask about their workload: do they handle many cases? How much of each case do they personally oversee, and how much do they delegate to assistants?How will a lawyer contact me?Make sure you and your attorney are on the same page about communication. Ask about their preferred communication methods, and whether they are willing to use your preferred communication methods. Does the lawyer you are considering hiring accept (and respond to) communication via email? Will they respond if you send a text? Make sure they respond promptly (within 24 hours) to your initial inquiries--you don’t want to hire a lawyer who won’t return your calls or avoids prompt communication about your case.What is their availability, should I need to contact them?It’s especially important to understand a potential lawyer’s availability. Will they be going on a three-week vacation in the middle of your case? Do they take phone calls after business hours? Do their legal assistants have a way to contact them if they are not in the office? You should have a good sense of how and when your lawyer will be available to communicate with you.Let's find your lawyerThe Avvo advantageAvvo gives you all the information you need to find the right lawyer.50 states120 areas of lawDetailed profiles including reviews50 states120 areas of lawDetailed profiles including reviewsMore View attorneys by stateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDist. of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingView attorneys by cityAtlanta, GAAustin, TXBaltimore, MDBoston, MABrooklyn, NYBuffalo, NYCharlotte, NCChicago, ILCincinnati, OHCleveland, OHColumbus, OHDallas, TXDenver, CODetroit, MIEl Paso, TXFort Lauderdale, FLFort Worth, TXFresno, CAHouston, TXIndianapolis, INJacksonville, FLKansas City, MOKnoxville, TNLas Vegas, NVLos Angeles, CAMemphis, TNMiami, FLMilwaukee, WIMinneapolis, MNNashville, TNNew York, NYOrlando, FLPhiladelphia, PAPhoenix, AZPittsburgh, PAPortland, ORRaleigh, NCRiverside, CASacramento, CASaint Louis, MOSan Antonio, TXSan Diego, CASan Francisco, CASan Jose, CASeattle, WASpokane, WATacoma, WATampa, FLTucson, AZWashington, DCSet LocationCity and stateCancelSaveLawyer Mark Bregman - Phoenix, AZ Attorney - Avvo

 Absolutely the Best!							
We hired Michelle and her team to evaluate two estates. She and her team invested the time to fully understand our current situation, along with the detail of our desires if/when we should pass away. Since we are not married, this added some complexity because we wanted to create the necessary legal documents to flow…
