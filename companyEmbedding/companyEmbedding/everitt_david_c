Mr. Everitt also serves on the board of directors for Agrium Inc., Brunswick Corporation and Harsco Corporation.
 
Our Board has concluded that Mr. Everitt should serve as a director because of the extensive industry experience in sales, marketing and operations, particularly with respect to information technology, gained from his positions as Interim Chief Executive Officer at Harsco Corporation and the President of Deere & Company's largest division in the areas of engineering, manufacturing and global operations.
