VASCO Data Security International, Inc. is a publicly-traded cybersecurity technology company based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. The company is known for its two-factor authentication and electronic signature software, which manages digital assets and online transactions for financial institutions. It was founded by T. Kendall Hunt in 1991 and held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2000. Vasco is a member of the FIDO Alliance Board.[2][3]
History[edit]
In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded VASCO Corp. as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. The company acquired ThumbScan Inc., which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer,[4] in 1991. It was renamed VASCO Data Security International, Inc. by 1993 and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.[5]
Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. Forbes recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.[6][7][8]
The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.[9][10][11][12]
In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, Inc., a Canadian document e-signature company, for $113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentification feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.[13][14][15][16][17][18]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

VASCO®Data Security International, Inc. Launches Overlay Detection in DIGIPASS for Apps to Help Protect Mobile Applications
Jun 21 17
VASCO®Data Security International, Inc. announced its ability to help organizations detect and mitigate mobile application overlay attacks through added functionality in the DIGIPASS® for Apps Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) module. Overlay attacks are increasingly being deployed to steal user login information. The ongoing attack on Android devices named Marcher has already targeted 117 banking applications. Overlay malware allows attackers to create screens that sit on top of legitimate Android applications and intercept information that can compromise a user’s security and privacy. To help prevent damage during an overlay attack, organizations can use the overlay detection functionality from DIGIPASS for Apps, which offers a library of APIs that natively integrates application security, biometric authentication, risk analysis and more into mobile applications. While the attack is occurring, the overlay detection functionality can close the targeted app and open a browser to notify the end user and the organization from which the legitimate app originates.

VASCO Data Security International, Inc. is a publicly-traded cybersecurity technology company based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. The company is known for its two-factor authentication and electronic signature software, which manages digital assets and online transactions for financial institutions. It was founded by T. Kendall Hunt in 1991 and held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2000. Vasco is a member of the FIDO Alliance Board.[2][3]
History[edit]
In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded VASCO Corp. as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. The company acquired ThumbScan Inc., which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer,[4] in 1991. It was renamed VASCO Data Security International, Inc. by 1993 and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.[5]
Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. Forbes recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.[6][7][8]
The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.[9][10][11][12]
In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, Inc., a Canadian document e-signature company, for $113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentification feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.[13][14][15][16][17][18]

VASCO Data Security International, Inc. is a publicly-traded cybersecurity technology company based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. The company is known for its two-factor authentication and electronic signature software, which manages digital assets and online transactions for financial institutions. It was founded by T. Kendall Hunt in 1991 and held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2000. Vasco is a member of the FIDO Alliance Board.[2][3]
History[edit]
In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded VASCO Corp. as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. The company acquired ThumbScan Inc., which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer,[4] in 1991. It was renamed VASCO Data Security International, Inc. by 1993 and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.[5]
Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. Forbes recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.[6][7][8]
The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.[9][10][11][12]
In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, Inc., a Canadian document e-signature company, for $113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentification feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.[13][14][15][16][17][18]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
