VIVO's Map of Science visualization depicts the topical expertise a university, organization, or person has 
based on past publications loaded into VIVO. Shown here is the expertise profile of the Miller, Patrick E.--larger 
circle sizes denote more publications per topic area.
Learn more about VIVO's Map of Science visualization?


The table below summarizes the publications plotted on the Map of Science. Each row corresponds to a 
(sub)discipline on the map

The # of pubs. column shows how many of the publications were mapped to each (sub)discipline. This count can be 
fractional because some publication venues are associated with more than one (sub)discipline. Each publication 
in such a venue contributes fractionally to all associated (sub)disciplines according to a weighting scheme.

The % of activity column shows what proportion of the publications were mapped to each (sub)discipline.



This visualization is based on the publications we were able to 'science locate' for Miller, Patrick E., and 
therefore it may not be fully representative of the overall publication activity for Miller, Patrick E..

The publication coverage of this visualization can be improved by including more publication data in the VIVO 
system, and by ensuring that each publication in the VIVO system is associated with a journal that the Map of 
Science recognizes (based on the holdings of Thomson's ISI database and Elsevier's Scopus database). Journal 
names containing typos or other idiosyncrasies may need to be cleaned up before they are recognized. You may 
contact a VIVO system administrator if publication coverage is a concern.

Publisher's Description▼▲
 In this theological exposition of Deuteronomy, Patrick Miller is sensitive to the character of the book as a part of scripture that self-consciously addresses different generations. He discusses the nature and character of the law as revealed in Deuteronomy, as well as the nature of the moral life under God. The treatment of Deuteronomy in the New Testament, and customary introductory issues such as authorship and date, are dealt with in terms of their significance for interpreting and understanding Deuteronomy's character and intention.Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching is a distinctive resource for those who interpret the Bible in the church. Planned and written specifically for teaching and preaching needs, this critically acclaimed biblical commentary is a major contribution to scholarship and ministry.


Author Bio▼▲

He is the author of numerous books, including The Religion of Ancient Israel.  He is coeditor of the Interpretation commentary series and the Westminster Bible Companion series.

Randall Mashburn






  
            Patrick Miller's insight into Deuteronomy will grip your attention from introduction to last page. He provides great overview and depth of the intent of the author and exposes the real meaning of the book. Miller has a masterful way of making connections and pointing out nuances in this treatment. Once you read this book your ability to preach and teach its contents and divine purposes will be expanded. It is must reading for understanding the place and importance of Deuteronomy in the canon and for background for NT study. Money well spent.
