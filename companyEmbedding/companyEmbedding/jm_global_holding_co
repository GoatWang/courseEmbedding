HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.

Blank check company JM Global Holding files and sets terms for a $50 million IPO


June 16, 2015, 05:25:26 PM EDT
By Renaissance Capital, Renaissance Capital

JM Global Holding Company, a blank check company formed to
acquire a small cap consumer products business, filed and set terms
on Tuesday with the SEC to raise up to $50 million in an initial
public offering.



The Delray Beach, FL-based company plans to raise $50 million by
offering 5 million units at a price of $10. At that price, it would
command a market value of $66 million. Each unit consists of
one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one-half of one
share at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share.



The SPAC was formed by entrepreneur Qi (Jacky) Zhang, CEO
of Nanjing Joymain Science and Technology Development Co.,
Ltd., which sells health care consumer products in China. Zhang
intends to purchase 3,000,000 units on the IPO, or 60% of the
proposed float, which would result in a post-IPO stake of 70% -
unusually high for a blank check company. JM Global Holding will
target consumer products businesses with an enterprise value
between $50 million and $200 million.



JM Global Holding Company, which was founded in 2015 and booked n/a
in sales for the 12 months ended , plans to list on the NASDAQ
under the symbol WYIGU. JM Global Holding Company initially filed
confidentially on 5/7/2015. Cantor Fitzgerald is the sole
bookrunner on the deal.

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $190,750 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of loans made to us by our sponsor and one of our
    executive officers. These loans will be repaid upon the earlier of the
    completion of this offering or December 31, 2015.

(2) $50.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($57.5 million if the underwriter exercises its overallotment option in full)
    will be placed in a trust account held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
    located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
    Company, acting as trustee.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

A total of $50.0 million (or $57.5 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering
and the private placement will be placed in a trust account with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in
United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or
in money market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for
any interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment
of taxes or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i)
the consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 24
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriter’s overallotment option), subject to applicable law; or (iii)
otherwise upon our liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to
liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business
combination prior to the expiration of the 24 month period (our board of
directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration
if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the
remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy
regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business
combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. If we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt
securities, or if we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account
for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination,
we may use the remaining cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of
acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust and interest income on the amount in the trust account that
may be released to fund working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay
our costs and expenses prior to our initial business combination. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. In addition, if we
increase or decrease the size of this offering, it would result in a
proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned in the trust
account and available to us. While we currently do not know what our future
working capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be
proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe that any additional
interest income earned would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration
and consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor, Zhong Hui Holding Limited, has
loaned us $140,500, and one of our executive officers has loaned us $50,250, to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans, and any
subsequent loans, are and will be non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of December 31, 2015 or the completion of this offering. In order to
fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
combination, our sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates or
other third parties may loan us additional amounts, although they are under no
obligation to do so, and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the
proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon
completion of an initial business combination. If we do not consummate an
initial business combination, we may use a portion of any working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds
from the trust account may be used for such repayment, other than interest
income earned thereon. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts,
the unpaid amounts would be forgiven. Any part or all of such loans may be
converted into additional warrants at $0.50 per warrant (a maximum of 1,000,000
warrants if up to $500,000 is loaned and that amount is converted into warrants)
of the post-business combination entity at the option of such parties. The
warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to our sponsor.

The payment to an independent third party of a monthly fee of $5,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support although in the future, our affiliates or affiliates of our
officers, directors or sponsor, may take over the provision of these services
for amounts not exceeding $5,000 a month. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. We
anticipate that our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities
that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their
shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct
negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached
in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no
limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders, directors,
officers or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act or in
transaction which would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the
Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may
pay. We will notify stockholders of such purchases, if any, by press release,
filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Moreover, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. If the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our
initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below
$5,000,000, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the
business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; or (iii) otherwise upon our liquidation or in the
event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases
to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of
the 24 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify
an attractive acquisition target or satisfy regulatory and other business and
legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

The initial holders, including our sponsor, have agreed to waive their
redemption rights (i) with respect to their founder shares and placement shares
in connection with the consummation of a business combination and (ii) with
respect to their founder shares and placement shares if we fail to consummate a
business combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering
(excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option) or if we
liquidate prior to the expiration of the 24 month period. However, our sponsor
and parties associated with it will be entitled to redemption rights on the same
terms as other public stockholders with respect to up to 2,000,000 of 3,000,000
public shares which may be purchased by them in this offering; they will waive
their redemption rights with respect to the remaining 1,000,000 public shares
that may be purchased by them in this offering in connection with the
consummation of a business combination.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our
public stockholders (including to holders of up to 2,000,000 shares included in
units which may be sold to our sponsor and its associated parties in this
offering) who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources
available to us for an initial business combination. In addition, the number of
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed in April 2015 that will seek to effect a
merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or
entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial


 business
combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities
and activities relating to this offering. We have not identified any acquisition
target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any discussions,
directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any acquisition target. We
have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate
operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business
combination.

For our initial business combination we intend to focus on industries that
complement our management team’s background, focusing on the consumer products
sector in the United States (which may include a business based in the United
States which has distribution opportunities outside the United States). Consumer
Products include goods and services that are bought for personal and household
use and intended for direct use or consumption. We will tend to focus on
established products that have a long history of consumer demand, are used
frequently and must be replaced as opposed to durable items that people keep for
a long time, such as cars and furniture. These type of products and segments are
also easier to manage and operationally forecast, of which our management team
and directors again have much experience with.

We will seek to acquire established consumer product branded businesses that we
believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial,
operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We do not
intend to acquire start-up companies, companies with speculative business plans
or companies that are excessively leveraged.

Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire, and
after our initial business combination, to build, a diversified consumer
products branded company. We will focus on consumer companies that distribute a
broad range of products for various customers and end use markets in either
multiple channels, (a few examples are selling these products through retail
stores, purchasing online or via a direct selling experience) but also might be
limited in geography. We believe our management team has prior and current
experience and access to sales channels and consumer markets outside the United
States as well that could be helpful in a consumer product business combination.

Although our focus and efforts will be to acquire a consumer product business we
are not, however, required to complete our initial business combination with a
consumer products business and, as a result, we may pursue a business
combination outside of that industry.

We will seek to capitalize on the significant consumer products experience and 
contacts of Qi (Jacky) Zhang, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Tim 
Richerson, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director, 
and the financial expertise of Peter Nathanial, our President and a director, to
identify, evaluate, acquire and operate a target business. If we elect to pursue
an investment outside of the consumer products industry, our management’s 
expertise related to that industry may not be directly applicable to its 
evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus 
regarding that industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the 
business that we elect to acquire.

We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify,
evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist
businesses we acquire. However, our management team’s network of contacts, and
its investing and operating experience, do not guarantee a successful initial
business combination. The members of our management team are not required to
devote any significant amount of time to our business and are involved with
other businesses. We estimate that our officers will dedicate an average of 15
to 20 hours per week to our affairs. We cannot guarantee that our current
officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other
role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of
benefit to us until we complete our initial business combination. Past
performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to
any business combination we may consummate.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of
the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. However, we
may structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of the
equity interest or assets of the target business, but only if we (or any entity
that is a successor to us in a business combination) acquire a majority of the
outstanding voting securities or assets of the target. We believe that, if we
own a majority of the target’s outstanding voting securities, we will not be
required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, since the securities of a
majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are
not deemed to be “investment securities” as defined in the Investment Company
Act, and since we expect that 60% or more of the value of our total assets
(excluding government securities and cash) will be represented by the securities
of our target business which we expect will be an operating business. Even if we
own a majority interest in the target, our stockholders prior to the business 
combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business 
combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in 
the business combination transaction.

Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or
more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least
80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting
commissions or taxes payable on interest) at the time of our signing a
definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The
fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of
directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial
community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable
businesses. If our board is not independently able to determine the fair market
value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and that is reasonably acceptable to Cantor
Fitzgerald, with respect to fair market value and that such an initial business
combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. However,
if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we
will no longer be required to consummate a business combination with a target
whose fair market value equals at least 80% of the balance in the trust account
(less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest). In
addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we
anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our
attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market
participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to
divest non-core assets or divisions.

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive
due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews
of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial
and other information about the target and its industry.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a
company that is affiliated with our sponsor, initial holders, officers or
directors, nor are we prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or
entering into any similar transaction with our sponsor, or an affiliate of our
sponsor, in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to
complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with
our sponsor, one of our initial holders or any of their respective affiliates in
our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of
independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm that is a member of FINRA and reasonably acceptable to Cantor
Fitzgerald with respect to fair market value that the business combination is
fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.
