August 19, 2008 03:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time



JASPER, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kimball International, Inc. (NASDAQ: KBALB) today announced the 
      appointment of Thomas J. Tischhauser to the Company’s 
      Board of Directors. His appointment becomes effective with his election 
      at today’s Board meeting.
    


      Kimball International Board Chairman Douglas A. Habig welcomed 
      Tischhauser, saying, “Tom’s 
      experience and executive leadership, combined with his international 
      business knowledge, will help us broaden the expertise of our Board. In 
      addition to his obvious knowledge of the automotive industry, including 
      the EMS industry, he also has substantial long term management and 
      executive development experience. His input, advice and coaching will be 
      a welcome addition.” Habig added, “Tom’s 
      values clearly reflect our corporate Guiding Principles and sense of 
      ethics.”


      Mr. Tischhauser is a former Vice President of Continental Automotive 
      Systems Group, where he served as General Manager of the Powertrain and 
      Chassis Business Unit, North America & Asia, responsible for all aspects 
      of the unit. Previously, he held the position of Corporate Vice 
      President and General Manager for Motorola’s 
      $1.6 billion Automotive Electronics Group. In addition, he was 
      responsible for the divestiture and post acquisition integration of the 
      Motorola unit into Continental Automotive, a $5.4 billion company. 
      Tischhauser spent over two years as an expatriate, on assignment in 
      Wiesbaden, Germany where he served as Vice President and General Manager 
      of Motorola’s Automotive Interiors and 
      Electronics Group, European Region, managing six sites throughout Europe.
    

      Tischhauser, 50, began his career with International Harvester Company 
      in 1980 as a mechanical engineer in their Agricultural Equipment 
      Division. He then joined Motorola’s 
      Communication Sector, beginning a progression of advancements in 
      responsibilities and professional development. A recipient of five U.S.
