Stonepine Capital Management Sends Letter to Board of Directors of 
      Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc.




Says Offer From Majority Owner Chiesi Too Low; Urges Independent 
      Directors to Obtain Significantly Higher Price in an Effort to Protect 
      Minority Shareholders






February 27, 2013 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAUSALITO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stonepine Capital Management, LLC (“Stonepine”) sent a letter to the 
      Board of Directors of Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cornerstone”) on 
      Monday, February 25. In the letter, Stonepine expressed serious concerns 
      for the minority shareholders of Cornerstone as it relates to a 
      potential transaction with its majority owner, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A 
      (“Chiesi”). The full text of the letter follows:
    


      February 25, 2013
    

VIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY & OVERNIGHT MAIL


      Board of Directorsc/o Andrew Powell, Corporate SecretaryCornerstone 
      Therapeutics, Inc.1255 Crescent Green Drive, Suite 250Cary, 
      NC 27518
    

      To the Directors of Cornerstone Therapeutics:
    

      We are the principals of Stonepine Capital Management, LLC 
      (“Stonepine”), a health-care focused investment firm.
    

      We are minority shareholders of Cornerstone 
      Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cornerstone”) 
      and own 700,000 shares.
    

      We note the recent proposal 
      by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A (“Chiesi”) in which Chiesi proposes to 
      acquire 100% of the Common Stock of Cornerstone that it does not already 
      own for $6.40 to $6.70 per share in cash.
    

      As minority shareholders of Cornerstone, we appreciate that Chiesi also 
      sees tremendous value in Cornerstone and is interested in acquiring the 
      company.
    

      However, we have serious concerns for the minority shareholders as it 
      relates to this potential transaction:
    

1. The Chiesi proposal grossly undervalues Cornerstone.


      Assuming the high end of the proposed acquisition range, or $6.70 per 
      share, Cornerstone would be sold for approximately 1.5 times expected 
      2013 revenues on an enterprise value basis (taking into consideration 
      the company’s debt) and 1.1 times expected 2013 revenues on a market 
      capitalization basis. In a sector where companies and pharmaceutical 
      products are often sold in the range of 3 to 5 times revenues, Chiesi’s 
      opening offer range is much too low. For example, an offer for 
      Cornerstone at 3 times expected 2013 revenues on an enterprise value 
      basis would constitute an offer value far more typical for the sector, 
      equating to an approximate $16 per share acquisition price for 
      Cornerstone.
    

2. Wall Street believes the Chiesi proposal is a “low-ball 
      offer” that “should be rejected by Cornerstone shareholders.”


      A recent research report by Ladenburg Thalmann (“Ladenburg”), the only 
      sell-side firm that covers Cornerstone, concludes that the current offer 
      is a “low ball offer“ and “should be rejected by Cornerstone 
      shareholders.” Ladenburg conducted “Sum of Parts,” “Peak Sales” and 
      “Discounted Cash Flow” analyses of the company, resulting in valuations 
      ranging from $11.37 to $17.19 per share, with a $14 per share price 
      target ultimately assigned to the company.
    

      Chiesi states in their offer letter that “Cornerstone would be best 
      positioned for long term growth and development as a private company and 
      would benefit substantially from the synergies and shared resources that 
      would result from this transaction with Chiesi.” Chiesi is not offering 
      to share enough of this benefit with Cornerstone’s minority shareholders.
    

3. Chiesi has effectively blocked the ability of Cornerstone to run 
      an auction process with other potential bidders or conduct traditional 
      “market checks” regarding the fair acquisition value of Cornerstone.


      We understand that Cornerstone is deemed a “Controlled Company” within 
      the meaning of the applicable rules of Nasdaq, as more than 50% (in this 
      case 60%) of the voting power of the company is held by Chiesi. In 
      addition, Chiesi has certain control rights through Cornerstone’s 
      Certificate of Incorporation, namely, the ability to block any 
      substantial sale or disposition of Cornerstone assets. We also 
      understand that Craig Collard, Cornerstone’s CEO, is subject to a 
      Stockholders Agreement with Chiesi, which requires Mr. Collard to vote 
      his quite substantial ownership of Cornerstone in favor of a transaction 
      whereby Chiesi or its affiliates would acquire all of the outstanding 
      stock of Cornerstone. Lastly, Chiesi made the following quite clear in 
      its offer letter to Cornerstone: “Please note we are interested in 
      acquiring the remaining shares of Cornerstone and we have no interest in 
      a disposition of our controlling interest or in considering any other 
      strategic transaction involving Cornerstone.”
    

      This collectively has created a situation whereby Chiesi is the only 
      feasible acquirer of Cornerstone. As a Board you will be unable to 
      effectively conduct a competitive auction process or conduct meaningful 
      “market checks” to ensure that the minority shareholders are obtaining 
      the best value for a potential sale to Chiesi. Consequently, it is 
      incumbent upon the independent Directors of the Board to ensure that a 
      fair value for Cornerstone is negotiated with Chiesi compared to 
      Cornerstone remaining a stand-alone entity. We are in favor of 
      Cornerstone remaining a stand-alone entity if the independent Directors 
      of Cornerstone cannot obtain a substantial improvement in the offer 
      terms from Chiesi.
    

4. We are concerned as to whether Cornerstone has established 
      sufficient governance procedures within the Board of Directors to 
      conduct a robust and fair negotiation process with Chiesi.


      We note from your proxy statement of April, 2012 that the Board has 
      determined that Mr. Codeanne, Mr. Enright, Mr. Harper, Mr. Heffernan and 
      Mr. Stephan are “independent directors” as it relates to Nasdaq rules, 
      indicating that such persons do not have a relationship which would 
      interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the 
      responsibilities of a Director. However, as a Director of Chiesi 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA, a subsidiary of Chiesi, we believe that Mr. 
      Stephan is highly conflicted in the current situation and should be 
      recused from all deliberations and negotiations regarding the Chiesi 
      proposal. This is particularly important given that a group of truly 
      independent Directors should be solely responsible for negotiating a 
      potential transaction with Chiesi in order to manage the obvious 
      conflicts of interest present in this situation.
    

      We note from your February 25 press release that the Board has 
      established a Special Committee comprised of five independent Directors 
      in order to coordinate a response to Chiesi. However, you have not 
      disclosed the Director composition of the Special Committee. We believe 
      it is important to disclose to Cornerstone’s minority shareholders the 
      composition of the Special Committee and that it be comprised of truly 
      independent Directors that are not conflicted.
    

5. Chiesi has unique access to advanced, confidential 
      information regarding Cornerstone; therefore, the minority shareholders 
      are at a substantial disadvantage in evaluating any deal terms.


      Chiesi’s offer letter states that they have “…conducted an extensive 
      review of Cornerstone based upon publicly available information…” In 
      fact, Chiesi likely has broad confidential access to Cornerstone’s 
      improving operational and financial results well in advance of 
      Cornerstone’s quarterly reports to its public shareholders.
    

      For example, two of Cornerstone’s Board members are key executives at 
      Chiesi: Dr. Anton Giorgio Failla, Head of Corporate Development and 
      Marco Vecchia, Head of Legal and Corporate Affairs. And a third 
      Cornerstone Board member, Robert M Stephan, serves as a Board member of 
      Chiesi Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Chiesi. These three 
      Cornerstone Board members all have insider access to Cornerstone’s 
      confidential information while at the same time performing key roles for 
      Chiesi.
    

      In addition, Chiesi is the licensor of two of Cornerstone’s key 
      products: Curosurf and Bethkis. By way of the related product license 
      and distribution agreements between the two companies, Chiesi has unique 
      advanced knowledge regarding the performance metrics for these products.
    

      These dynamics put Chiesi in the advantageous position of being able to 
      quickly evaluate and bid on Cornerstone’s improving business, to the 
      potential detriment of minority shareholders. We sincerely hope that the 
      Board puts the Company’s minority shareholders on an equal footing with 
      Chiesi as it relates to the negotiation of Chiesi’s acquisition proposal.
    

Summary


      In summary, we view the current offer from Chiesi as grossly 
      undervaluing Cornerstone. Furthermore, we believe that the construction 
      of the company’s ownership and Board create unique challenges to 
      navigating this process in a way that is fair and equitable to the 
      minority shareholders. We appeal to the independent Directors of the 
      company to thoughtfully consider these issues in representing the 
      minority shareholders of Cornerstone.
    

      We would be happy to discuss this further with you, or any subset of the 
      Board, at your convenience.
    



          Best regards,
