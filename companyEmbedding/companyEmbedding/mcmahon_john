portfolio: Audience 3D at NetBaseLed team of 8 (5 engineers, 2 testers and 1 designer) from product concept to market for Audience 3D, a social audience analysis tool that increases user engagement of ad campaigns for digital marketers. Before A3D, digital marketers weren't satisfied with how they built audiences and targeted them on social media. A3D allowed them to define engaged audiences from psychographics, such as people who are passionate about a brand and show high purchase intent for one of its products, and surface messaging and images known to move and resonate with them. With A3D, digital marketers achieved 2.5x engagement rate, 20% higher purchase rate and 4x reach for ad campaigns. The product generated $600K in sales in its first six month – the most successful product launch in company history!
































 







portfolio: crusheD at crushedResponsible for the product management efforts and a team of 4 (2 engineers, 1 tester and 1 designer) for this social wine app that answered the simple question "What should I drink tonight?" for wine drinkers. Before Crushed, wine drinkers stood frustrated in front of an in-store wine selection and made purchasing decisions based on wine labels or unhelpful tasting notes from staff. Crushed armed these wine enthusiasts with the necessary information to make personalized and informed purchases. Specifically, they got wine recommendations from friends and influencers, tracked their favorites, and learned about specific wines in real-time. We knew we were onto something when our users were 40% more likely to make a wine purchase that they were happy with.
































 







portfolio: patient access intelligence at medeanalyticsOversaw team of 12 (8 engineers, 3 testers and 1 designer) for Patient Access Intelligence, a productivity tool that addresses delinquent patient accounts for healthcare providers. Before PAI, healthcare providers lost a significant amount of money on these accounts where the patient fails to pay for rendered services. PAI captured these forfeited dollars by front-loading the patient account lifecycle with employees who are responsible for registering patients before their arrival. Between the registration workflow, third party integrations and error detection, healthcare providers increased collections by 16% and saw 23% more patients with PAI. This product grew to $400K MRR, or by 150%, during my time managing it.

John is driven and a creative, agile product manager. He has been instrumental in the most successful product launch in the company’s history with Audience 3D. Credit goes to his data-driven decisions, customer first design and lean approach to product development. John is not only a great product guy but also an excellent team player, who cares about the people he works with and the culture of the company.

— Ranjeet Bhatia, Vice President of Product Management, NetBase


I’ve worked with John for two years at NetBase and have been impressed with his dedication to his work. On the Data Science team we often build tools that require a good user experience, and John has been invaluable for giving us feedback on UI design and workflows that make sense to an end user. When it comes to defining a project, John is able to go through real data and give specific guidelines on expected results. He is also able to identify areas where a project could be scaled back to minimize scope and expedite release of a first version. John has shown great enthusiasm in collaborating with my team, and we’ve enjoyed working with him.

— Karin Golde, Director of Data Science, NetBase


John is one of the few PMs who genuinely advocates for objectively measuring the quality of the user experience in order to check assumptions and make space for improvements. He’s great at keeping track of all the moving parts of an intricate engineering project, and has the empathy to ensure everyone is on the same page. I enjoyed working closely with John at NetBase, and would love to work with him again.

— Edward Lazzarin, Data Engineer, Facebook


John is a very diligent and committed individual who took his job responsibilities very seriously. I had initially recruited him as a user interface engineer and he did an excellent job in implementing a new enterprise-SaaS product using the state of the art web technologies. After he became the Product Manager for the same product, he worked with all the stakeholders and created very precise and well-defined specifications that served both the development team and the customer teams effectively. John is very passionate about the user-interaction and in providing value to the customers while factoring in the costs. With this experience, his eagerness to learn quickly and willingness to work with all the teams, John would make an excellent Product Manager.

C. Matthew McMahon, Ph.D., Th.D., is an American theologian and adjunct professor at Whitefield Theological Seminary. 

Is there a more beloved Scriptural passage than John 3:16? Throughout church history, there has not been a more quoted or preached upon verse than this one. It is that special text concerning God’s love for the world and the eternal life that is found in the person of Jesus Christ. The richness of this special life-changing verse is seen in Jesus’ dialogue and instruction to the Pharisee Nicodemus. Christ’s teaching in this passage demonstrates that Nicodemus was living a life devoid of the power of the Holy Spirit, and attempted, in outward religious acts, to please God by his perceived good works. Jesus’ instruction cures Nicodemus from his man-centered religious views, and brings the Pharisee back to the meaning of the Old Testament, and God’s plan of redemption. Being faithful to the text, McMahon considers this most important verse... More > in its complete context of John 2:23-3:21.< Less

WWE sent us the following this afternoon:




MATTEL AND WWE® LAUNCH GIRLS PRODUCT LINE 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., and STAMFORD, Conn., July 20, 2017 � Mattel and WWE are launching a girls' product line that features the first-ever fashion dolls of Nikki and Brie Bella, Sasha Banks, Natalya, Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, Alicia Fox and Eva Marie, to leverage the popularity of WWE's female Superstars and give its sizable girl fan base a new way to connect with their favorite brands.
The new WWE Superstars product line, which was revealed today at San Diego Comic-Con, offers fans an original way to play and includes the following:
12" fashion dolls that are articulated and come with multiple fashions inspired by Nikki and Brie Bella, Sasha Banks, Natalya, Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, Alicia Fox and Eva Marie.
Role Play items that include a WWE Women's Championship title belt with authentic styling and sleek metallic medallions, in addition to fun accessories like a Bayley-inspired headband and Sasha Bank's "Legit Boss" rings.
Action figures that have deluxe articulation and bold ring looks that include the Superstar's iconic accessories.
This is the first time female WWE Superstars will have a fashion doll and role-playing line, in addition to the action figures inspired by their in-ring characters. The dolls will be available for preorder online only at Toysrus.com beginning Monday, July 24, and exclusively at Toys"R"Us® stores nationwide and Toysrus.com this September.
"The launch of the first-ever WWE girls' product line is a significant moment in the evolution of not only our female Superstars, but our entire company," said Stephanie McMahon, WWE Chief Brand Officer. "We are honored to partner with Mattel to provide kids with another way to connect with our incredible female performers who inspire confidence and strength."
"At Mattel, we have a deep understanding of how girls play and are proud to be WWE's partner in bringing the first ever female Superstar fashion doll line to fans, said Lori Pantel, SVP and GM for Girl's Toy Box. "This line shows girls that they too can be a WWE Superstar and fits well within our portfolio of girl's brands by offering unique doll aesthetics with empowering messages."

This is the first time female WWE Superstars will have a fashion doll and role-playing line, in addition to the action figures inspired by their in-ring characters. The dolls will be available for preorder online only at Toysrus.com beginning Monday, July 24, and exclusively at Toys"R"Us® stores nationwide and Toysrus.com this September.
"The launch of the first-ever WWE girls' product line is a significant moment in the evolution of not only our female Superstars, but our entire company," said Stephanie McMahon, WWE Chief Brand Officer. "We are honored to partner with Mattel to provide kids with another way to connect with our incredible female performers who inspire confidence and strength."
"At Mattel, we have a deep understanding of how girls play and are proud to be WWE's partner in bringing the first ever female Superstar fashion doll line to fans, said Lori Pantel, SVP and GM for Girl's Toy Box. "This line shows girls that they too can be a WWE Superstar and fits well within our portfolio of girl's brands by offering unique doll aesthetics with empowering messages."
