Energy Saving Tip

Install ceiling fans to keep cool air circulating so you can turn down your air conditioner. Still, make sure to turn off your fan when you leave the room.











Look Up. Look Out. Stay Safe.

Be very aware of overhead power lines coming into your home. Always keep yourself, your ladders and tools at least 10 feet away.

Muslim Tatar Minorities in the Baltic Sea Region














 



Go to Online Edition






Edited by Ingvar Svanberg, Uppsala University and David Westerlund, Södertörn University





In Muslim Tatar Minorities in the Baltic Sea Region, edited by Ingvar Svanberg and David Westerlund, the contributors introduce the history and contemporary situation of these little known groups of people that for centuries have been part of the religious and ethnic mosaic of this region. The book has a broad and multi-disciplinary scope and covers the early settlements in Lithuania and Poland, the later immigrations to Saint Petersburg, Finland, Estonia and Latvia, as well as the most recent establishments in Sweden and Germany. The authors, who hail from and are specialists on these areas, demonstrate that in several respects the Tatar Muslims have become well-integrated here.
Contributors are: Toomas Abiline, Tamara Bairasauskaite, Renat Bekkin, Sebastian Cwiklinski, Harry Halén, Tuomas Martikainen, Agata Nalborczyk, Egdunas Racius, Ringo Ringvee, Valters Scerbinskis, Sabira Ståhlberg, Ingvar Svanberg and David Westerlund.

Profile

Publications






David Westerlund, Ph.D. (Stockholm University), is Professor in the Study of Religions. His research and teaching concern first and foremost three religious fields: African Indigenous Religions, Islam (particularly Islamism and Sufism) and Christianity (especially Pentecostalism). Geographically, he focuses primarily on Africa and Europe and secondarily on Latin America. His Africa-oriented research has, above all, been pursued in Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa. Thematically, inter-religious relations, religion and politics, historiography as well as religion and health belong to his primary interests.
