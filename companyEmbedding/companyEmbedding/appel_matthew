                  Failed the class with a D, however, Appel is a good teacher. You genuinely have to try in his class, which I didn't do. I deserved the grade I got and I am not mad at Appel at all. Labs are easy. Tests are basically your grade, study well for the tests. Also I didn't touch the textbook the entire semester, so maybe that was something.

                  This class was really difficult. He doesn't explain much and rushes through the lessons. The only way to pass this class is if you study everyday and aren't taking any other classes. I took my lab class with a different prof and he explained the lesson way better. I was doing really well in school until I took this class.

                  I had to spend so much time outside of class trying to understand what it was that he was teaching. It was unfortunate we got our class cancelled twice, but Dr. Appel tried to make up for it by rushing through lessons as fast as he could (with messy writing) with no time for us to process the material before he moved on.

                  His class was really interesting and he gets really engaged with most of his lectures, he'll try to explain as best as he can but  he also goes through his lectures pretty fast. I would recommend to print out an outline of notes to keep up with and to rewrite them again. Test are to be expected,  take a look for the worksheets they do help

                  He posts outlines so you can take notes on it & worksheets & practice exams.  I honestly had to put in the work, but it was my 1st time learning chemistry. When studying I suggest redoing the worksheets, redoing the homework & practicing exams & also writing down things you need to memorize. takes a little while to grade exams.

                  I have taken Dr. Appel for two semesters in a row, and I am pleased I have done so. Initially Chemistry was not my strongest subject and was dreading it before hand. Since then, I've grown an appreciation in chemistry I previously wouldn't expect to have. I credit that to Dr. Appel.

AMAZING LECTURES


                  Matt is an amazing teacher. he is extremely clear when teaching and takes so much time to make sure you know the info. he is a pretty strict grader but not unfair he will give partial credit. gives some ec and hw which is helpful. chem isn't an easy subject but he will gladly help you if you need extra help. I would take him again.

                  I think Matt's lecture and lab were fair. Exams r straightforward because they are similar to practice problems. Make sure you master the basics (sig figs!!) because more likely than not he will catch small mistakes and in turn cost u big pts on tests.. He's a great professor, so ask questions about anything! He will prepare u for chem 180.

                  Hard work'll be rewarded. If that isn't the case, consider revising your method of studying--go to the Success Center or visit Appel during office hours for help. Use all resources provided on his websiteWebAssign to study. There are quizzes, 3 lec exams+1 cml. final, & 1 lab exam. A lil pain in the bum but overall v helpful. Bonus: hottie alert!

                  I dropped this class along with a lot of other people in my lab. The only reason he has a good review on here is because he acts like nice guy and makes jokes in class. His explanations were really heard to understand, and I took ap chemistry in high school and got an A. He is very strict about his rules even in extreme circumstances no quiz makeup

                  This class was pretty good. The exams are difficult due to time. You must know your stuff going into the exam because you won't have time to figure things out. His lectures are entertaining. He tries very hard to appeal to his students ("Mr. Cool Guy"). That was the only part that bothered me. Study hard, make flash cards and you'll be fine.

                  I had him as a sub for Vieau's lab class when she took medical leave. TAKE APPEL. He is WAY WAY more helpful than Vieau. He seems strict but he just wants you to do well. If you have questions, ask him, he will clear everything up for you.

He is fair and is always willing to help; make sure to study for the tests, they are difficult with out some preparation, even if believe to have a firm understanding of the material (I would know!)

                  This guy is so freaking horrible.   I was interested in Chemistry so much until I met him.   One could know so much, but won't know how to teach.   So confusing with his lecture.   Takes days to reply emails.   Had to study from the book by myself.   Go ahead and take him, so open seats from other professor will be available for me !!!  Thank you.

                  Difficult but take him if you actually want to learn. Had to drop the class because of personal reasons (I had a valid reason to ask for an incomplete but he REFUSED to help) but I learned more in his class Than I did when I retook it w someone else. He WILL meet you during office hrs if you ask and if you need help. Lots of work but worth it.

                  You will get an A for the class FOR SURE if you take time to do the hw and practice test(Test is pretty much like the practice test&hw, nothing tricky). He always held study session before test, super helpful. Also he makes time to answer any question you have, super patient. Lots of extra credit. Attend class and take notes you'll be fine.

Apple - The Masters of Product Placement

 Thursday, September 13, 2012 at 3:06PM 

The behemoth company, Apple, worth billions of dollars, dwarfs all other companies in sales of its devices. More iPhones are sold every year than there are cars sold worldwide. Apple sells more than 55,000 iPads every single day and 2.47 iPods every single second. There is no stronger company in the entire world.Apple, however, faces the same problem that all other companies have: consumers have “tuned out” advertisements, so now companies have to find out how to bypass this indifference to their products. Marketers have been working to find a better way to reach these consumers, and product placement, specifically in movies, appears to be the solution.Marketers have strategically placed various products within movies from the very beginning of the industry. Even in the silent films, you can see Hershey’s chocolate being eaten by the heroine or in the 1930s, Wrigley’s Chewing Gum prominently featured in various scenes, or Gordon’s Gin being thrown over the side of the boat in African Queen. Subtle, yes—but the brand image stayed in front of the audience. Marketers found that discreet placement of products within movies would keep that product brand image fresh, positive, and in front of the eyes of the public, painlessly. Because of that, product placement in movies has a direct effect upon sales of that product, and with a huge financial reward beckoning, most marketers are willing to pay a considerable amount of money for the privilege of their product appearing in movies. Apple is the one brand which is the exception; Apple does not pay for any product placement, yet is the number one company for product placement in movies today. “Apple won’t pay to have their products featured, but they are more than willing to hand out an endless amount of computers, iPads, and iPhones,” says Gavin Polone, movie producer. The Apple devices are perceived of as “cool” or “sexy”, thus becoming very desirable not only for movie production employees, but also movie-goers. On most movie sets, Apple devices far outnumber any other products because of this perception, and Apple has staff whose specific job is to make sure Apple is in every big movie and out in front of viewers, perpetuating that belief of sexy and cool. This great give-away of Apple products has paid off on a grand scale for the company. Brand Channel awarded Apple the 2012 Product Placement of the Year for its effective product placement within movies—Apple devices were in over 40% of the box office hits of 2011. No other product even comes close to these stats.What is all of this product placement worth to Apple? In a nutshell: tens of millions of dollars. In the movie, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol,  Apple was not an official brand partner and did not pay to have its products on screen, yet Apple devices still had eight minutes of free time on screen, with a placement value of over $23 million.  In the first Mission: Impossible, Apple did not pay for placement of the PowerMac, but agreed that Apple would “strongly promote” the movie in its ads, saving the movie almost $500,000 in production costs and of course, accruing more glory for Apple. In You’ve Got Mail, 33% of all of the products featured were Apple products, garnering 3:58 minutes in air time. That kind of advertising simply can’t be purchased. Apple is truly the exception, both as company and product promoter. Never paying but always giving, Apple bestows product in order to receive placement.
