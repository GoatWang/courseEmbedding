Marcus Partners Announces Sale of 500 Plaza Drive in Secaucus, NJ
                       READ MORE >

BOSTON, MA - Marcus Partners, a value-oriented real estate investor, developer and operator, today announced that, in conjunction with a global institutional partner, it has sold 500 Plaza Drive, the world headquarters of Quest and The Children’s Place, in Secaucus, New Jersey.  
500 Plaza Drive is an approximately 460,000-square-foot Class A office tower offering urban convenience within a prime suburban location.  Located at the crossroads of Route 3 and the New Jersey Turnpike, 500 Plaza is accessible via public transportation in approximately 15 minutes from Midtown Manhattan.  The property is situated within the iconic 200-acre Harmon Meadows, a 4.4M square foot amenity-rich environment with numerous restaurants and hotels, more than 1 million square feet of national and big box retail, a newly developed LA Fitness Club and a 14-screen movie theater.  The “live, work, play” nature of Harmon Meadows will be further bolstered by Hartz Mountain’s development of 470 new apartments, expected to be completed this Fall. 
During its ownership, Marcus Partners completed a $17.8 million base building capital improvement program which transformed the property into a state-of-the-art, high quality work environment. The repositioning program included a complete lobby renovation, significant common-area upgrades, creation of a full-service cafeteria, coffee bar, conference center, and high end fitness center/locker rooms, along with substantial upgrades to both building finishes and grounds. As part of the program, Marcus Partners also constructed a new 222-car parking deck, renovated an 1,100-car parking deck, and created 34 visitor-parking spaces.  Since the renovations were completed, ownership has signed five leases totaling approximately 258,000 square feet, which collectively increased occupancy to 99%.  Leasing activity included a new world headquarters location for Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and a renewal of AXA.
“The newly redeveloped 500 Plaza offers tenants and visitors alike an exceptional work environment, providing both the convenience and amenities demanded by premier organizations and their employees.  Today the property is a unique headquarters-quality facility and we are proud to continue providing property management services under the property’s capable new ownership,” said Paul Marcus, CEO of Marcus Partners.
500 Plaza Drive was the last acquisition in Marcus Capital Partners Fund I, LP.  Marcus Partners is currently investing its fully discretionary $250 million Marcus Capital Partners Fund II, LP, pursuing a mix of strategic and opportunistic investment strategies.  It is seeking well-located commercial office, medical office, industrial, research and development, and life science properties located along the East Coast.  It currently owns and/or manages a diversified portfolio that includes nearly 8 million square feet of commercial real estate.

New Jersey Landlords Sweeten Perks With Ride-Hailing SubsidiesBy Keiko Morris | Wall Street JournalREAD MORE >

Services such as Uber and Lyft could help companies, especially those near public transportation and downtowns, brokers say.
New Jersey office landlords have been sprucing up their properties with everything from food trucks to fitness centers to compete in an era when urban amenities are in vogue.
 The latest enticement: Subsidies for digital ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.
Hugo Neu Corp. in March launched a program offering $50 monthly credits for each tenant employee without a car to commute to Kearny Point, an ongoing project to redevelop historic shipyard buildings into office and light-industrial space in Kearny, N.J.
The real-estate investment firm Marcus Partners, meanwhile, is offering new tenants a ride-sharing program that pays the first $3 of a trip to or from its newly acquired office building just outside Morristown’s center in New Jersey.
“Morristown is a wonderful town not only because you have a train station but also because you have restaurants and nightlife,” said David P. Fiore, a principal at Marcus Partners and head of the company’s New York metro region. “We thought the flexibility of a ride-sharing program allows tenants and employees a strong connection to downtown.”
While residential landlords nationwide have been testing similar programs, such incentives from office owners are relatively rare. Services such as Uber and Lyft could help New Jersey office landlords, especially those in areas that are a few minutes’ drive to public transportation and vibrant downtowns, real-estate brokers said.
Subsidizing ride-hailing services also could help landlords attract tenants looking to pack more people into less office space, particularly in areas where parking is tight, brokers said.
“The trend is companies putting more people in less space for efficiency and cost effectiveness,” said David Simson, a vice chairman at real-estate services firm Newmark Grubb Knight Frank. “When you are in the suburbs, you run against the wall that is parking.”
Older office buildings were built with three to four parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space, but modern office spaces require upward of five spots per 1,000 square feet, according to a Newmark report. Adding parking decks can cost between $20,000 and $35,000 per space, the report said.
Parking constraints for train commuters prompted Summit city officials last fall to launch a pilot program subsidizing city residents’ rides to and from the train station. The participants pay $4 a day round trip and the city subsidizes the rest.
So far the program, a possible alternative to expensive new parking, has freed up 30 to 35 parking spaces a day, said Michael Rogers, Summit’s city administrator. The city has increased the number of participants in its program from 100 to 150 people.
Adequate parking, however, hasn’t been the issue for the property at Kearny Point’s Building 78, which houses many small businesses from tech firms to artisanal food makers, and offers a co-working space. Hugo Neu, which owns and develops real estate, added the Uber credits to provide another transportation option and has found that its co-working tenants, many of whom don’t have cars, have been using about half of the credits, said Nick Shears, director of leasing at Hugo Neu.
The Uber subsidy is what allowed Alak Vasa, founder of chocolate maker Elements Truffles, to add three people to her team at Kearny Point and keep a critical employee who had been with the company in its first space in Jersey City.
“We have people who live in Jersey City who we have already invested in,” Ms. Vasa said. “How do we get them here?”
Marcus Partners is hoping the incentive will provide a seamless connection to downtown Morristown, which is nearly 2 miles away.
The ride-share program, which isn’t yet in use, is one more amenity the company hopes will draw tenants to the 121,000 square feet of space available at the Morristown building, which its brokers said offers less expensive rents than those downtown. Marcus also is investing about $7.6 million in improvements that include a new glass facade, better lighting and terraces.
“The divide we have to get across is being in a downtown location,” said Bill Brown, executive director at real-estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield and part of the team marketing the building. “And the way we’re trying to bridge the gap is with a ride- sharing service.”

Marcus Partners Purchases 44 Whippany Road in Morristown, NJPlans Transformational Repositioning ProgramREAD MORE >

Norwalk, CT – Marcus Partners is pleased to announce the acquisition of 44 Whippany Road, a
229,157 SF first class office building in Morristown, NJ for its newest fund, Marcus Capital Partners Fund
II, L.P. Over the last three and a half years, Marcus Partners has purchased over 1 million square feet of
commercial real estate in New Jersey alone, including both office and life science properties.
44 Whippany Road is centrally located with quick access to Interstates 287, 78, 80 and Route 24.
Tenants at 44 Whippany also benefit from convenient train connectivity, with two train stations located
less than 5 minutes away from the property offering transportation throughout Morris and Essex
communities as well as points east including Newark and New York City.
Marcus Partners will immediately commence a $7.6 million capital improvement program that will
transform the property into an exceptional, high quality office property matching the standards Marcus
Partners has set at other properties it owns throughout the Tri-State area. The planned repositioning

Marcus Partners Bolsters Executive TeamNames Steve Wassersug PrincipalREAD MORE >

Boston, MA – Marcus Partners,, a value-oriented real estate investor, operator and redeveloper today announced that Steve Wassersug, formerly the firm’s Senior Vice President of Construction and Development, has been promoted to Principal.

“I am delighted to welcome Steve to the Principal team,” said Paul Marcus, Chief Executive Officer

of Marcus Partners. “Our team, tenants, and limited partners have all benefited from Steve’s deep

Parking becoming key part of deals: Office space shrinking, but not need for spotsREAD MORE >

When it came time to market 10 Sylvan Way to tenants last year, Normandy Real Estate Partners made sure to leave no stone unturned.
That meant completing the base building design and securing the local approvals needed to gut and rebuild the 125,000-square-foot office property in Parsippany. But the firm saw one other issue it had to tackle: The 30-year-old building would need more parking to accommodate the type of high-end, high-density corporate user it was seeking.
“(That) was something that came a little bit later in the design, as we started talking to tenants and recognized that this is something that is going to be an important problem to solve, to make sure we check every box,” said Paul Teti, principal and head of leasing for Normandy.
The developer did just that by building a new single-story parking deck and redesigning the surface lot at 10 Sylvan, upgrades that increased the parking capacity from 388 to 522 spaces. They also were also a key selling point for Zoetis, the onetime Pfizer animal health spinoff, which has leased the full building as its headquarters and will move in around Labor Day.
“I can say without question that adding that parking was an absolutely critical component in order to get this specific tenant and, I think, any tenant of this size into the project,” Teti said. “(In the 1980s), the space utilization was just completely different, and the site was planned for that kind of parking, so being able to solve for the parking with the single-story deck made all the difference in the world and allowed us to capture the tenant, for sure.”
Landlords and developers in New Jersey are taking a likeminded approach. As corporate tenants pack more employees into smaller spaces — in an effort to save on real estate costs — the parking capacity at many suburban office buildings is no longer enough.
Building owners are responding by adding to that capacity, a move that helps them stand out in a market with a glut of highway-centric office space.
“It certainly is a competitive advantage, but I actually think it’s more of a necessity,” said David Fiore, principal and New York area market director for Marcus Partners.
The Boston-based real estate investment firm owns 500 Plaza Drive in Secaucus, where it recently built a new 222-car parking deck and last month inked a 130,000-square-foot lease with Quest Diagnostics.
Building a parking structure is not quite so simple, given the costs and the need to secure approvals from the local government. Experts say building costs can range from $20,000 to $35,000 per space, meaning even smaller projects can amount to millions of dollars.
Fiore said the structure at 500 Plaza Drive, along with the renovation of an existing 1,100-space garage, accounted for about a third of roughly $17 million in capital improvements launched by the firm after it acquired the building in 2014. But it was a worthwhile investment to attract a tenant such as Quest and the roughly 600 employees that will move in by next year.
“It was always part of the program,” Fiore said. “A central part of our acquisition of the property was to have the ability to increase the parking density, because we knew that any major users out there that we were trying to attract would come to us and say, ‘We need more parking than the standard building.’ ”
Tim Greiner, a broker and executive managing director with Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, said those costs are typically passed onto tenants, but noted that those companies are likely saving on rent in the long run because they’re taking significantly less space. He said there are other tenants in the market that are seeking smaller footprints and will likely push landlords to readapt their parking options.
It’s one reason why Lincoln Equities Group, which Greiner’s firm represents, presented the option of building a new parking structure earlier this year as it marketed the vacant, 450,000-square-foot former Pfizer building at 5 Giralda Farms in Madison.
As for obtaining local approvals, he said governing bodies have long sought to minimize parking garages on properties in their towns. But with the state’s abundance of empty office buildings, those municipalities that wish to compete for major corporations “have changed their tune and are working with those owners and developers.”
“A lot of towns, historically, have said, ‘I don’t want a big parking deck on my lot — it’s ugly, it doesn’t do anything, it’s just not a pretty sight in the middle of suburban office parks to have these giant decks everywhere,’ ” Greiner said. “But those towns that are letting developers do that will win more deals going forward because it’s definitely a trend that’s happening.”
Teti expects the ability to add parking to be increasingly important in vying for suburban deals, but not simply because companies have consolidated their footprints across the board. Corporate tenants such as Zoetis “may not be solving for that parking issue every day,” he said, but have to allow for ebb and flow in their headcount for those times when work-from-home or out-of-market employees need to show up at the office.
“(Some of these companies have) town hall meetings and things like that, where they’ve got days where their population swells and that’s where the additional parking need often times comes in,” Teti said. “So it’s not necessarily going to be utilized every day, but it’s a critical component of their plan going forward.”
New deck designFor landlords who are building new parking structures to compete for tenants, the column-filled, concrete boxes of the past are no longer an option.“Any new structure that we build, we build column-free so that you don’t have to worry about backing out and losing your mirror to a column,” said David Fiore, principal and New York area market director for Marcus Partners, which owns 500 Plaza Drive in Secaucus. “So we make the parking decks as comfortable and easy to use as possible. “And, of course, people are always concerned about security, so we typically have things like gates and cameras to monitor the garages. Good lighting is also very important.”

car parking deck, renovation of an existing 1,100-car parking garage, and the creation of 34

Quest Diagnostics to 500 Plaza. This is a special asset, and with the transformation of the

property, we realized our vision to deliver the best asset in the market. I have to admit, the

transformation even exceeded my expectations. My hat’s off to Gensler and our entire design

and construction team.” Gensler, led by Dana Nalbantian, was the architect for the project.

The move to 500 Plaza Drive allows Quest Diagnostics to retain its New Jersey employees while

being in better proximity to public transportation and many of its major health providers. The

new office location will host approximately 600 employees.

Principal of Marcus Partners. “It’s one of the few single-asset large blocks of

space that exist in central 128 capable of accommodating a variety of uses, with

a parking ratio that is well above market (4.5 per 1,000 sf), clear heights up to

19 feet, full building back up power, a high window to floor area ratio, full service

cafeteria and new roofs and HVAC units. Deb Van Der Hayden of Jones Lang

Lasalle (JLL) and Scott Jamieson, formerly of JLL, who managed the transaction

for ADP, did a great job in bringing the transaction to completion for their clients.”


Marcus Partners has been actively growing through various acquisitions along

the East Coast over the past 18 months with 11 transactions totaling over 3.1

million square feet of office, bio-medical, medical office, R&D and industrial

space in the Miami, Atlanta, Washington DC, Suburban NYC and Boston

markets. This transaction brings Marcus Partners portfolio of properties owned or

managed by its affiliates to 6.9 million square feet.


Paul Marcus, Managing Principal of Marcus Partners, said “This acquisition fits in

well with our investment strategy of acquiring assets at a reasonable basis that

are well located and offer a real value-add opportunity for a hands-on owner. We

already have interest in the asset from both office and lab users, it’s versatile

enough to work well for either.” Marcus added “We continue to seek additional

value add real estate related investment opportunities throughout East Coast

markets with a focus on office, medical office, light industrial, flex, R&D and

warehouse properties.

April 2010Verizon Breaks Ground On Technology Innovation Center In Waltham, Mass. - Fierce WirelessREAD MORE >

Multimillion-Dollar Investment in Verizon Technology Innovation Center Includes New Building, R&D Labs, Executive Briefing Center at Existing Verizon Technology Campus
BASKING RIDGE, N.J., and WALTHAM, Mass., - Verizon broke ground today on its new Technology Innovation Center in Waltham, Mass. The center will be a catalyst for delivering new and innovative devices and services that connect people, places and things, using next-generation wireline and wireless technology.
The Verizon Technology Innovation Center will be the first-of-its-kind collaboration hub for expanding the telecommunications ecosystem by taking advantage of the convergence of new technologies to offer customers powerful new products and services.
The brainchild of Dick Lynch, Verizon executive vice president and chief technology officer, the Verizon Technology Innovation Center is designed to provide a central base for Verizon's advanced technology initiatives. It will house office and lab space for some of the country's leading technologists and scientists as well as a state-of-the-art Executive Briefing Center where partners, consumer electronics companies, innovation collaborators, business executives and public officials can meet to discuss and collaborate on forward-looking technologies such as FiOS and next-generation 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless technology. Application and advancement of these new technologies will be a key focus.
Together with the Verizon Technology Campus at Waltham - which houses Verizon technical staff focused on end-to-end architecture, design and testing of the Verizon network as well as IT applications development - the Technology Innovation Center will employ a total of more than 300 leading technologists. The additional space will provide the facilities, partner meeting spaces and collaboration areas that are necessary to keep the Waltham campus a world-class center.
Work at the Verizon Technology Innovation Center will include:

Planning for the continued integration of Verizon wireline and wireless networks 
							Providing a home base for the development of the first nationwide 4G LTE network in the U.S., now undergoing user trials in the Boston area 
							Expanding support for third parties that are working on new devices and applications for use on Verizon's networks 
							Ongoing testing to ensure continued global network interoperability with other worldwide network companies, including British Telecom, Deutche Telekom, France Telecom, NTT and China Telecom 
							Optimizing and advancing the portion of the Internet provided and maintained by Verizon 
							Maximizing connectivity and performance of Verizon's customers to the Internet 
							Conducting user experience testing and focus groups for products such as FiOS TV and FiOS broadband 
							Developing ideas and applications for the National Science Foundation's Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) project for Web 2.0 
							
Verizon's Lynch said, "Verizon is recognized as a global leader in innovation and technology, and the Verizon Technology Innovation Center will allow our world-class scientists and IT professionals to continue to have the leading-edge resources they need to develop the technologies, products and services that can dramatically change the way we live. As a Massachusetts native, I'm extremely pleased to be here shaping Verizon's technology investments and creating Verizon's future technology vision in the Bay State."
The Verizon Technology Innovation Center is scheduled to be completed in early 2011 and will include a 60,000-square-foot, three-story facility located in the Reservoir Woods East Campus off of Winter Street in Waltham. The property is owned by Davis Marcus Partners, a venture between Marcus Partners and The Davis Companies, in partnership with Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI). The new building, designed by noted Boston architect Howard Elkus of Elkus-Manfredi, will be developed to LEED Silver standards of the United States Green Building Council.
When the Verizon Technology Innovation Center is complete, the current 136,000-square-foot Verizon Technology Campus in Waltham will be expanded to a total of 196,000 square feet.
Waltham was selected as the site for the new center because of the company's partnership with local high-tech innovators, including Airvana, Starent (now part of Cisco), Camiant, Acme Packet, NetNumber and Sonus Networks, and because of the site's proximity to other local entrepreneurial tech firms and the wealth of Massachusetts' academic and research institutions.
The Waltham location also supports Verizon's leadership in the Massachusetts IT Collaborative, an organization formed by Gov. Deval Patrick and composed of business, academic and government leaders who are working to create more investment opportunities and jobs in the IT sector in the Bay State.
Greg Bialecki, Massachusetts secretary of housing and economic development, noted, "The Verizon Technology Innovation Center brings a new generation of wireless technology innovation and opportunity here to Massachusetts. This investment is key to supporting the state's constantly growing technology sector, and is a prime example of what is possible here in the Commonwealth."
The site in Waltham also serves as the hub of wireless technology and user trials in the Boston area. Verizon Wireless has been testing its forthcoming 4G LTE network in Boston since August 2009 and is on track to deliver an outstanding wireless data experience to customers in the area, as well as in 25 to 30 other markets, covering roughly 100 million people by the end of this year.

September 2009Marcus MoveREAD MORE >

BOSTON—As Hub-based real estate investment firm Marcus Partners continues to gear up for a national buying spree, founder and namesake Paul Marcus has brought on another seasoned professional, hiring David Keiran as a principal and chief financial officer to oversee the company’s financial activities and manage investor relations. Most recently at the New Boston Fund, where he was an SVP and director of investor relations, Keiran has more than 25 years experience in accounting, client service, finance, portfolio management and taxation matters.
“David’s institutional real estate experience and relationships will complement our management and investment strategy and enhance our ability to provide the highest level of reporting and client service,” Paul Marcus says in a release welcoming Keiran to the firm, which recently raised $210 million of new capital in anticipation of what he terms “a wave of opportunistic properties” that will emerge in the coming years.
Keiran concurs with the notion that deteriorating industry fundamentals “should translate into attractive asset pricing,” and says he looks forward to the new position. Prior to NBF, Keiran was a partner at TA Associates Realty, where his responsibilities included marketing and asset management of commercial and multifamily assets. Other knowledge was gleaned earlier in his career at PriceWaterhouse where he specialized in banking, investments and real estate.



September 2009Keiran Named Principal/Chief Financial Officer At Marcus PartnersREAD MORE >

David Keiran has been hired as a principal and chief financial officer at Marcus Partners, a Boston-based real estate investment firm.
Keiran will oversee the company's financial activities and to manage investor relations.
He has more than 25 years of experience in many facets of real estate investment and management, including accounting, taxation, finance, marketing, client service and asset and portfolio management.
Before joining Marcus Partners, Keiran was senior vice president and director of investor relations for New Boston Fund. Prior to New Boston, Mr. Keiran was a partner at TA Associates Realty.
"We are pleased that David has joined the firm to round out our team of real estate investment professionals," said, Paul Marcus, managing principal. "His institutional real estate experience and relationships will complement our management and investment strategy and enhance our ability to provide the highest level of reporting and client service."
Having recently raised more than $210 million of new investor capital, Marcus Partners is anticipating a wave of opportunistic properties coming to market over the next few years, the company said in a statement.
"Downward pressure on real estate pricing continues to build as the excesses of the past few years are reversed. The caution on the part of buyers, combined with guarded lenders, deteriorating market fundamentals and more assets being brought to market should translate into attractive asset pricing. We realize that we need to be patient and let the markets unfold and are excited about the opportunities that lay ahead," said Keiran.



July 2009Marcus Partners closes fund, targets D.C.READ MORE >

Marcus Partners plans to dip into its new $210 million fund to invest in the D.C. area.
The Boston-based real estate investment firm wants to target a mix of properties -- including office, bio-medical, medical office, and light industrial properties -- in metro areas east of the Mississippi River with Marcus Capital Partners Fund I.
Marcus Partners plans to invest $400 million into value-oriented real estate or related assets, shooting for individual deals in the range of $10 million to $130 million.
Institutional investors -- which include pension plans and endowments -- put up the bulk of the capital and smaller contributors include family offices and high-net-worth individuals. The fund took a little less than a year to raise, according to Kyle O’Connor, who will manage the fund and oversee the company’s investment activities in the D.C. and mid-Atlantic region.
“You have to prepare yourself for capital commitments prior to getting to the point where interesting investments come up so that you can take advantage of them when the time is right,” he said. “The formation period precedes the investment period.”
He says the fund is actively pursuing investment opportunities in the D.C. area, with a concentration on office space, and has submitted investment offers in a variety of buildings that have come on the market. He notes that it may take some time before any deals close.
“In the long-term view we do believe in Washington as a marketplace but the investment markets are fairly anemic right now.”

Newly-formed Marcus Partners has raised $210 million for its debut private equity real estate fund, and is expected to formally close the vehicle at the end of the year with up to $250 million in commitments.
The Boston-based investment firm has raised the capital from high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, who have had previous relationships with founder Paul Marcus.
Marcus set up the firm in June 2008 after he split from longtime business partner Jonathan Davis. The pair had run development company Davis Marcus for around 15 years.
Several former Davis Marcus executives were hired by Marcus. Former AEW Capital director Kyle O’Connor also joined the firm recently as principal to manage Marcus Capital Partners Fund I and have responsibility for investments in Washington DC and the mid-Atlantic region.
He told PERE the firm was in no rush to deploy the capital saying: “It’s fairly early in the down-leg of the cycle but every day we are starting to see more and more interesting opportunities.”
The seven-year, closed-ended fund is aiming for IRRs in the upper-teens, he added, employing a value-added strategy targeting office, medical office and light industrial properties and debt in metropolitan cities in the East of the US. He added that strategy classifications were “blurred” in today’s environment, and that Marcus Partners could do a mix of core and opportunistic-style investing. “In this market flexibility is needed,” he said. 



July 2009Marcus Partners Closes Fund I READ MORE >

Real estate investment firm Marcus Partners has closed Marcus Capital Partners Fund I, which will pursue diversified investments, including office, biomedical, medical office, and light industrial properties. The fund’s geographical focus will be on major metropolitan areas east of the Mississippi River.  
Marcus Partners closed $210 million of capital commitments and is actively looking to invest $400 million in value-oriented real estate assets. Most investors are institutions and family offices, as well as high-net-worth individuals.  
It will invest $10 - $130 million in each deal, with a focus on buying assets at discounts, recapitalization of distressed or overleveraged owners, taking advantage of pending loan maturities and defaults, purchasing distressed debt and investing in select capital-constrained situations.  
The news comes after the recent hire of Kyle O’Connor, who will manage Fund I and oversee the investment activities in the Washington, D.C. market and the Mid-Atlantic region. O’Connor comes aboard as a principal, after having served as Metzler North America and AEW Capital Management. 



July 2009$250M Fund Aims East of the MississippiREAD MORE >

BOSTON-Locally based Marcus Partners is closing its Marcus Capital Partners Fund I, which is focusing on office, bio-medical, medical office and light industrial properties in major cities "primarily east of the Mississippi River," states a release. The fund is currently at $210 million. 
The assets being targeted will range from $10 million to $130 million. The fund will invest roughly $400 million dollars as they work out deals with roughly 50% debt, Paul Marcus, president of Marcus Partners tells GlobeSt.com. "We're looking at everything from distressed to just straight up purchases," he explains. "I think the fund will end up being probably about 60% to 70% C interests of either preferred equity or just direct fee ownership interests. And another 30% will be more debt related or 'special situations'." 
The fund will seek properties west of the Mississippi under certain conditions, noting it would have to be "a larger transaction that would include assets on both sides" of the river, Marcus says. "We would look at anything from cash-flowing real estate in a partnership-type transaction in a preferred equity structure, which is a lot of stuff that we're talking about now, to buying the assets and turning them around." 
Although this is a possibility, the fund has a time-frame of five to seven years, holding onto the majority of the property for four to seven years. "We think we're still early in this cycle," Marcus says. "and we believe there will be an enormous amount of opportunities becoming available over the next six to 24 months." 



July 2009With $210M Fund, Marcus Capital is Latest Firm to Seek Investment BargainsREAD MORE >

Looking to take advantage of the current bargains to be had in the investment market, Boston-based real estate investment firm Marcus Partners has closed Marcus Capital Partners Fund I with $210 million in capital commitments. The fund will cast a wide net, pursuing diversified investments including office, bio-medical, medical office and light industrial properties. 
The fund will be focused on major metropolitan areas primarily east of the Mississippi River. Leveraging the existing capital commitments, the fund is looking to invest $400 million into value-oriented real estate or related assets. 
The fund’s target individual deal size ranges from $10 million to $130 million. It will focus its efforts on acquiring assets at discounts to replacement cost and normalized value, recapitalization of distressed or overleveraged owners, taking advantage of pending loan maturities and defaults, acquiring distressed debt and investing in select capital-constrained situations. Marcus Partners investors are primarily institutions, family offices, as well as high-net-worth individuals. 
Marcus Partners joins a spate of other investment funds closing in recent months looking to capitalize on lower pricing in the investment market. On June 30, CPN reported that the Blackstone Group completed the final closing of Blackstone Real Estate Partners Europe III, with a total of approximately $4.3 billion in equity capital commitments. 
And in late April, private real estate investment firm Rockwood Capital L.L.C. closed an investment fund with some $964 million in capital commitments. The value-added fund, dubbed Rockwood Capital Real Estate Partners Fund VIII, plans to invest primarily in hotel, retail, office and residential properties in the United States. 
Earlier in the spring, CPN reported that apartment complex developer AvalonBay Communities Inc. closed a $400 million investment fund, $125 million of which was funded by the firm itself, with the remainder coming from institutional investors. With leverage, the fund can make up to about $1.1 billion in investments, most of which will be on properties in high barrier-to-entry markets in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Midwest and West Coast, the firm said. And on April 9, CPN reported that Wrightwood Capital closed a $243 million fund. The company's High Yield Partners II Fund will be invested in recapitalizations, acquisitions and selected new development projects.
Marcus Partners hired Kyle O’Connor to manage Fund I, as well as to oversee the company’s investment activities in the Washington, D.C., market and the Mid-Atlantic region. O’Connor joined the company as a principal.

Boston-based real estate investment company Marcus Partners recently closed the Marcus Capital Partners Fund I and added Kyle O'Connor to the firm to manage the fund. 
						Marcus Partners has closed $210 million of capital commitments and is actively looking to invest $400 million into value-oriented real estate or related assets. The company said it targets individual deal size ranges from $10 million to $130 million. It will focus its efforts on acquiring assets at discounts to replacement cost and normalized value, recapitalization of distressed or overleveraged owners, taking advantage of pending loan maturities and defaults, acquiring distressed debt and investing in select capital-constrained situations. 
The fund will be used to pursue a diversified list of investments east of the Mississippi River. Marcus Partners investors are primarily institutions, family offices, as well as high-net-worth individuals. 
"We are humbled and mindful of the confidence and trust that our investors have placed in us which enabled us to raise capital during these difficult market conditions," said Paul R. Marcus, managing principal of Marcus Partners. "Over the past 25 years we have developed meaningful and trusting relationships with investors and are excited about the investment opportunities that we are starting to see on the horizon. While remaining cautiously optimistic, we look forward to placing the fund's equity into investments that are both profitable and strategic in order to deliver significant returns for our investors." 
The company recently hired Kyle O'Connor to manage Fund I, as well as to oversee the company's investment activities in the Washington D.C. market and the Mid-Atlantic region. O'Connor is joining the company as a principal, adding to a team of principals that includes industry veterans William McAvoy, who oversees the Boston region; David Fiore, who directs the Connecticut and New York region; and J. Mark Stroud, who oversees the Southeast region. 
O'Connor brings more than 17 years of real estate investment experience to Marcus Partners, including the acquisition of approximately $4 billion in assets on behalf of both commingled funds and separate account clients. He previously worked at Metzler North America and AEW Capital Management.  



July 2009Has Money, Will SpendREAD MORE >

There’s a new buyer in town: Marcus Partners, a Boston-based real estate investment firm, has closed its first fund and wants to invest between 20% to 40% of it in DC real estate. Fund manager Kyle O’Connor tells us it has $210M of equity: that’s $400M in purchasing power. Marcus recently bid, unsuccessfully, on a few DC offices, one of which just traded. “We view the DC market as being one of the more stable and interesting in the nation.” Right now, though, the pickings are slim, with deal flow “anemic”, Kyle says. “We expect that to change.”
