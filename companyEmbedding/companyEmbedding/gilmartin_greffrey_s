Find Pulmonologists in Massachusetts (MA) by City

    A pulmonologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the lungs and respiratory tract.


    These specialists are similar to critical care specialists in that their patients often require mechanical ventilation to assist their breathing.


    Pulmonologists diagnose and treat patients with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, asbestosis, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, COPD, and emphysema. Exposure and inhalation of certain toxic substances may also warrant the services of a pulmonologist.


    Some of the tools and tests pulmonologists use to diagnose a patient are a stethoscope in order to listen for abnormal breathing sounds, chest X-rays, CT scans, blood tests, bronchoscopy, and polysomnography.

Pulmonologists in Boston, MA

    A pulmonologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the lungs and respiratory tract.


    These specialists are similar to critical care specialists in that their patients often require mechanical ventilation to assist their breathing.


    Pulmonologists diagnose and treat patients with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, asbestosis, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, COPD, and emphysema. Exposure and inhalation of certain toxic substances may also warrant the services of a pulmonologist.


    Some of the tools and tests pulmonologists use to diagnose a patient are a stethoscope in order to listen for abnormal breathing sounds, chest X-rays, CT scans, blood tests, bronchoscopy, and polysomnography.

There are 250   Pulmonologists in Boston, MA.

Dr. Gilmartin and his collaborators have designed and are implementing both animal and human studies to evaluate the vascular, metabolic and sympathetic nervous system responses to hypoxia in patients with OSA and normal volunteers.  The current protocols involve exposures to human subjects of 8 hours of hypoxia during a single exposure as well as two weeks of an 8-hour exposure to hypoxia overnight, every night.  Variables measured include MSNA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity), forearm blood flow (measured by venous occlusion plethysmography) and hypoxic ventilatory responses both before an after the exposures. In addition, ongoing clinical invetigations into the mechanisms of and response to treatment in central sleep apnea are a significant focus of his research. Trainees

             Specialties        






 


Pulmonology 

                                Pulmonologists are specialized physicians who diagnose and treat diseases and disorders of the respiratory tract. As a respiratory specialist, Dr. Gilmartin may diagnose and treat pulmonary disorders such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and bronchitis, among a host of others.                            






 


Critical Care Medicine 

                                Critical care specialists like Dr. Gilmartin provide life-saving care for patients in critical condition. Patients are usually cared for in within intensive care units (ICUs), and may receive life and organ support. Dr. Gilmartin may also work to stabilize patients and perform time-sensitive, potentially life-saving procedures.                            






 


Internal Medicine 

                                The specialty of internal medicine is an area of primary care for adults. Dr. Gilmartin specializes in diagnosing and treating cross-system illnesses that may affect multiple organ systems. When necessary, Dr. Gilmartin also can refer patients to specialist physicians when medically needed. For instance, patients with severe kidney problems can be referred to a nephrologist for further medical tests or treatments.
