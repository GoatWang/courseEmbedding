A Trust Amendment is a legal document that changes specific provisions of a Revocable Living Trust but leaves all of the other provisions unchanged, while an Amendment and Restatement of Trust completely replaces and supersedes all of the provisions of the original Revocable Living Trust.Understanding the Basics of Revocable Living TrustsBefore discussing when Trust Amendments or full Amendments and Restatements are required, you'll need to understand what is a Revocable Living Trust.









  A Revocable Living Trust is a legal contract between the Trustmaker and Trustee that can be changed at any time and requires the Trustee to oversee the management of property transferred into the trust by the Trustmaker for the benefit of the Beneficiary of the trust.The key to a Revocable Living Trust is the fact that it's revocable - meaning that at any time while the Trustmaker is alive and competent the Trustmaker can change, modify, update, or completely revoke the provisions of the trust agreement. Since this is the case, the name of the legal document that's required to change, modify, or update the trust agreement is called a Trust Amendment, and the legal document that's required to revoke the trust agreement is called a Trust Revocation.Contrast a Trust Amendment with a Trust Amendment and Restatement, which is a type of trust amendment that completely supersedes the terms of the original trust agreement.



 The name and date of your trust will stay the same (for more on this, see below), but each and every provision of the original agreement will be replaced by the terms of the restatement.When Are Trust Amendments vs. Restatements Required?While there aren't really any written rules as to when an Amendment instead of a full Amendment and Restatement is required, the general rule is that if the changes that the Trustmaker wants to make are minimal - adding or deleting specific bequests, changing who will serve as Successor Trustee, updating a beneficiary's or Successor Trustee's legal name due to marriage or divorce - then a simple Trust Amendment will cover these types of changes.









 On the other hand, if the changes that the Trustmaker wants to make are significant - adding a new spouse as a beneficiary, completely cutting out a beneficiary, changing from distributions to family members to distributions to charity or vice versa - then a complete Amendment and Restatement should be considered.What if you've made a series of three or four simple Trust Amendments over the past 10-15 years and you want to make another change? Then consider consolidating all of your changes into a complete Amendment and Restatement - this will prove to be helpful to your Successor Trustee who will have a single document to follow instead of piecing together the provisions of four or five separate documents.The Legalities of Trust AmendmentsIf you're considering making a change to your Revocable Living Trust, don't simply mark up your trust agreement and stick it back in the drawer. Why? Because a Trust Amendment must be signed with the same formalities as the original trust agreement, so your handwritten changes will, depending on applicable state law, either void the trust agreement or be ignored. Instead, ask your estate planning attorney to prepare the Trust Amendment for you so that it will be legally valid and binding on all of your beneficiaries.










Will the Name of Your Trust Change if You Amend or Restate It?The answer is No - the nice thing about doing a Trust Amendment or an Amendment and Restatement is that the original name and date of your Revocable Living Trust will remain the same. That way, all of the hard work you put into funding your Revocable Living Trust under the original trust name and date won't need to be undone.

Revocable Trust

What is a 'Revocable Trust'
   A revocable trust is a trust whereby provisions can be altered or canceled dependent on the grantor. During the life of the trust, income earned is distributed to the grantor, and only after death does property transfer to the beneficiaries. This type of agreement provides flexibility and income to the living grantor; He is able to adjust the provisions of the trust and earn income, all the while knowing that the estate will be transferred upon death.

BREAKING DOWN 'Revocable Trust'
A revocable trust is a part of estate planning that manages and protects assets as the grantor, or owner, ages. The trust is amended or revoked as the grantor desires and is included in estate taxes. Depending on the trust’s directions, the trustee, or holder of the assets, distributes the assets to the beneficiaries or holds and manages the property. The trust remains private and becomes irrevocable upon the grantor’s death.Characteristics of a Revocable TrustThe money or property held by the trustee for the benefit of someone else is the principal of the trust. The principal changes often due to the trustee’s expenses or the investment’s appreciation or depreciation. The collective assets comprise the trust fund. The person or people benefitting from the trust are the beneficiaries. Because a revocable trust lists one or more beneficiaries, the trust avoids probate.Advantages of a Revocable TrustIf the grantor experiences health concerns through the aging process, a revocable trust allows the grantor’s chosen manager to take control of the principal. If the grantor owns real estate outside his state of domicile and the real estate is included in the trust, an ancillary probate of the real estate is avoided.If a beneficiary is not of legal age and cannot hold property in his name, the minor’s assets are held in the trust rather than having the court appoint a guardian. If the grantor believes a beneficiary will not use the assets wisely, the trust allows a set amount of money to be distributed on a regular basis.Disadvantages of a Revocable TrustImplementing a revocable trust involves much time and effort. Assets must be retitled in the name of the trust to avoid probate. The grantor’s entire    estate plan must be monitored annually to ensure the trust’s objectives are being met. Costs of maintaining a revocable trust are greater than other estate planning tools such as a will. A revocable trust does not offer the grantor tax advantages. Since not all assets will be included in the revocable trust, the grantor must create a will to designate beneficiaries for the remaining assets, to avoid probate. During the grantor’s lifetime,       creditors can still reach the property in a revocable trust.

The term “UAD” is most commonly used when referring to a living trust. It stands for “under agreement dated” and it appears in trust instruments – their formation documents – to establish the type of living trust that has been formed. Financial and other institutions rely on it for tax and other purposes when they're dealing with the trust entity.Revocable vs. Irrevocable Living Trusts First, it helps to understand the significant differences between the two types of living trusts.









A revocable trust is one that can be changed at any time by the grantor – the individual who formed it. Quite often, the grantor serves as trustee. He retains control of the assets he’s funded into the trust and he reserves the right to change the terms of the trust. He can revoke it and take his property back if decides it no longer suits his purposes.Contrast this with an irrevocable trust which requires that the grantor step aside after he has formed and funded it. Someone else, either an individual or a financial institution, serves as trustee. The grantor cannot take back his property – he relinquishes it forever. He can’t revoke the trust or change any of its terms. Irrevocable trusts offer many tax and asset protection benefits that revocable trusts don’t share because of these significant distinctions, although both avoid probate.“UAD” Identifies an Irrevocable TrustWhen the term “UAD” or sometimes “U/A” appears in a trust instrument, it commonly designates an irrevocable trust.



 It translates to “trust under agreement dated” or “trust under agreement.” It indicates that the grantor and the trustee are two separate individuals and that the trustee controls the assets that have been placed within the trust. The trust instrument might read, “John Doe, Trustee of the Jane Doe Living Trust UAD 02/17/2017.” This tells a financial institution or another entity four things: 










John is the trustee.Jane is the grantor.Jane does not control the trust.The trust was formed by instrument dated February 17, 2017UAD vs. UDT Designations When the term “U/D/T” or “UDT” appears in an instrument, it means the opposite. It stands for “under declaration of trust.” The grantor and the trustee are the same person. The grantor maintains control over the assets he has placed into it, and he can only do this if the trust is revocable.Testamentary TrustsA testamentary trusts are created after the grantor has died, not during his lifetime as a living trust is. It's based on instructions contained in the decedent's will. By definition, a testamentary trust always carries a UAD designation. The grantor and the trustee must be two separate individuals because the grantor is deceased by the time the trust is formed. NOTE: The information contained in this article is not intended as legal advice and it is not a substitute for legal advice. If you’re considering forming a trust, please consult with an estate planning attorney who can advise you regarding the pros and cons of different types of trusts and how they might meet your needs.
