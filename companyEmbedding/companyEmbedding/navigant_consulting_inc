                                                1 Million X 2020
                                            


Navigant is dedicated to our ‘1M x 2020’ campaign, a Firm-wide goal to positively impact one million youth by the year 2020 by preparing them for college and their professional careers. This new initiative is at the center of Navigant’s corporate citizenship platform to empower the leaders of tomorrow.
Our participation ranges from hands-on service where we work directly with students and their families, to donating items for those in need, to financial contributions. The 1M x 2020 campaign does not change our current efforts; it allows us to grow and improve upon them.

Navigant employees will reach one million youth by:
Utilizing our Core Skills. We address challenges with specialized, unique and cross-practice skills - our ability to apply innovative and creative approaches to a variety of problems also applies to preparing children for college and career success.
Focusing on Learning and Gaining Knowledge. Our greatest asset is our people – and what makes Navigant unique is the intelligence, tenacity, and creativity of our people. 1M x 2020’s focus is on applying these attributes to help the youth in our communities prepare for college and for their careers.
Leveraging our Entrepreneurial Spirit. We pride ourselves in our ability to work with diverse clients and adapt to any situation. 1M x 2020 means working with students, non-profits, community programs, government leaders and other stakeholders to develop new ways to improve students’ college and career success.
Leadership Development. At the core of any college or career readiness program is developing leaders who can adapt to their changing environment and excel during times of challenge and confusion. Our employees lead by example.
Visit the 1Mx2020 interactive website designed to show progress towards our goal to better prepare one million youth for college and careers by the year 2020.  The website includes a running tally of the number of children we have impacted and stories of our efforts related to the 1Mx2020 initiative.

An exciting feature of the site is a new children’s book, authored by Craig Frazier, that is specifically aligned with our 1Mx2020 campaign. For each child we impact, part of a page will be revealed, with full pages being assembled as we move closer to our goal. At the conclusion of the campaign, we will print copies of the book to donate to

Navigant employees contribute thousands of hours each year to local organizations in a variety of capacities. We embrace skills-based volunteerism and share our skills and expertise with communities in need.

Navigant’s efforts are guided by a commitment to educate and empower tomorrow’s leaders through mentorship, community welfare programs, board memberships and other volunteerism. We are focused on helping today’s youth plan and prepare for tomorrow. Our ‘1M x 2020’ campaign cements this commitment by aiming to positively impact one million young people by the year 2020.

Charitable giving is an integral part of Navigant’s community outreach initiative. Over the past five years, we’ve donated more than $4 million to non-profit organizations throughout the United States, Canada, and the UK. Financial support is bestowed through our two philanthropic organizations: The Lending a Hand Foundation in the United States and Canada, and The Navigant Foundation in the United Kingdom.

Through local office initiatives, employees learn about the culture with celebrations that include trivia, dance and music, museum outings, or other culturally relevant initiatives. The ERG also sponsors firm-wide webinars that highlight the career paths and success stories of Asian professionals and newsmakers. 





                                                Black / African Ancestry
                                            


The Black/African Ancestry ERG’s mission is to support and advise its members- and Navigant as a whole - through cultural awareness and understanding that promotes hiring, retention and career advancement around education, professional growth and development. 
Black History Month (February)
Each year the Black/African Ancestry ERG commemorates Black History Month by celebrating the culture through a number of local office and Firm-wide of events.

                                                Latino Ancestry

                                                NAVPRIDE
                                            



The NAVPRIDE Employee Resource Group (ERG) is an internal global employee network formed around the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities.
The ERG’s progressive approach to LGBT issues is widely recognized. Navigant is among Human Rights Campaign’s Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality, and we have earned a 100 percent rating for eight consecutive years on HRC’s Corporate Equality Index.

National Pride Month (June)
 
NAVPRIDE celebrates National Pride Month each June with networking and awareness activities, including participating in the Chicago Pride parade, the DC Pride parade and the Indianapolis Pride parade. Past celebrations have included webinars on hot topics: an analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court Ruling on Marriage Equality; a conversation with Breanna Sinclairé, the first openly transgender woman to study and graduate from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music; and the pursuit of inclusion, presented by Annise Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city (Houston).
Anti-LGBT Legislation

Nearly 200 state and local governments have proposed legislative initiatives that negatively impact the rights of the LGBT community. These initiatives tear at the fabric of a forward-thinking, just, and open society. They are bad for business and bad for the communities where we live and work. Navigant opposes any legislation that allows discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals.

Navigant believes that every person deserves equal rights regardless of age, religion, race, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, nationality, or disability. Navigant stands against legislation that marginalizes our clients, colleagues, families, and friends.

Business Coalition for the Equality Act

Navigant proudly supports the Business Coalition for the Equality Act and passage of the Equality Act. The Equality Act establishes explicit, permanent protections against discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity in matters of employment, housing, access to public places, federal funding, credit, education, and jury service. In addition, it would prohibit discrimination based on sex in federal funding and access to public places. The Equality Act is designed to protect the LGBT community in many of the same ways that the Civil Rights Act protects racial minorities.

Navigant’s Women Employee Resource Group (ERG) provides an inclusive, multi-dimensional environment to support the connection and development of female employees.

Members of Navigant’s Women ERG gather regularly both in-person and virtually to discuss industry hot topics, personal and professional development opportunities and to network internally and externally. In several offices, members participate in  informative “power breaks” to connect, build relationships and further their professional development.  

Members also collaborate regularly with external organizations such as the Women’s Leadership & Mentoring Alliance (of which Navigant Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Julie Howard, is a founding member), and host our own annual Women in Leadership Business Forum.
International Women’s Day (March) 

Each year in March, the Women’s ERG celebrates International Women’s Day with firm-wide activities as well as office based programming. 
Example initiatives have included a screening of a shortened version of the film “Girl Rising.;  a panel discussion featuring the CEO of YWCA Metropolitan Chicago and senior Navigant professionals who discussed how women can create opportunities to make an impact within their communities; and a webinar featuring tips and tricks to achieve a more balanced life.





                                                Young Professionals
                                            


Navigant’s Young Professionals Employee Resource Group (ERG) is dedicated to the development of young professionals through networking opportunities, knowledge sharing, mentoring and increased exposure to leadership to elevate the employee experience.

Through their participation, young professionals further develop their skills, become better connected to each other and enhance their careers. Young Professionals at Navigant are invited to participate on a companywide-basis and in office-based programming designed to invest in their professional development. All activities are designed to meet the needs and objectives identified by the Young Professionals:
Companywide programming includes initiatives focused on building connections, networking and career development. Activities are often virtual / web-based.
Office-based programs include in-person panel discussions, networking events, community service drives and team building activities.





                                                Veteran and Military
                                            


Navigant’s Veteran and Military Employee Resource Group (ERG) is committed to the recruitment and development of Veterans.  As a Firm, we value the skills and experience that veteran and military professionals bring to the workforce.  Navigant is dedicated to providing a community where Veterans can grow their careers, share their experiences and become thought leaders.

Veteran & Military Observances 

Throughout the year, the ERG honors our veteran and military professionals on key days of observance.  Memorial Day and Veterans Day allow ERG members and all employees to honor, recognize and give thanks for the sacrifices made by veterans.  Example initiatives have included employees making paracord bracelets and writing letters of gratitude which were included in care packages sent to troops deployed overseas.   Yellow Ribbon Cake ceremonies have been held in various offices across the Company on 11/11 at 11:11am to commemorate the WW1 armistice between the Allied nations and Germany.  Employees have also participated in a jeans/camo day where donations were raised for organizations that support veterans and their families.  Additionally, a “Wall of Heroes” video montage was created to honor veterans in the lives of our employees.

Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers. As the economy of many nations in today�s date chugs on the growth of the service sector as it is contributing a substantial part to the GDP of a nation, hence it is a vital worldwide business prospect. As per service industry reports of a global survey, it has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals. Therefore it won�t be wrong to say that the service sector has today become a prominent feature for the smooth flowing of the economy of a nation as huge volumes of business just depend on this sector.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris.

Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]

Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Navigant was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.”[2] The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.[4]
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May [5] and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.[6]
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.[7]
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions.[8] Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.[9]
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation,[10] as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.[11]
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK.[12] In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.[13]
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007,[citation needed] followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.[14]
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.[15]
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston-based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.[16]
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.[17][18][19]
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.[20]
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.[21]
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.[22]
Services[edit]
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative[edit]
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.[23]
Financial Advisory[edit]
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.[24]
Economics[edit]
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.[25]
Management Consulting[edit]
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.[26]
Studies/Research[edit]
The Risk Management Paradox[edit]
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.[27]
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds[edit]
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.[28]
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment[edit]
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[[29]
Name and Branding[edit]
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.[30]
Corporate Citizenship[edit]

The firms charitable trust program, Lending A Hand foundation, has supported over 200 organizations committed to health and wellness, education and community welfare.[31]
During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.[32]
Criticism[edit]
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal[edit]
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish.[33] Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006,[34] prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.[35]
Long Island Power Authority Contract[edit]
In June 2013, the New York state Moreland Commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the New York utilities' handling of Hurricane Sandy, questioned some expenses in three limited instances charged by Navigant in previous years and in a press event referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors later found no wrongdoing.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
