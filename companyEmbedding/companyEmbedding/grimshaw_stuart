JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Loveliest Valley: A Garden In Sussexby Grimshaw, Stuart (Edt)/ Traeger, Tessa (Pht)Woolbeding House lies in the valley of the River Rother in West Sussex, an unchanging English landscape. Time had appeared to stand still when, in 1972, Simon Sainsbury and Stewart Grimshaw leased the house and gardens from the National Trust. For over four decades, they worked with a talented team of architects, designers and contractors to create a masterpiece of 20th-century garden design, a Sussex Arcadia. In "The Loveliest Valley" Stewart Grimshaw recalls catching intriguing glimpses of the house on visits to Sussex, the serendipitous nature of their purchase and the painstaking process of breathing new life into both house and garden. Photographer Tessa Traeger has captured images of Woolbeding in every type of English weather, extreme and benign, from dawn to dusk. "The Loveliest Valley" is a testament to how a beautiful garden can be created in the modern age, linking the great English gardening tradition with contemporary experimentation.Domestic, Landscape, LandscapeCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Book Description

macOS continues to lead the way in desktop operating systems, with its tight integration across the Apple ecosystem of platforms and devices. With this book, you will get an in-depth knowledge of working on macOS, enabling you to unleash the full potential of the latest version using Swift 3 to build applications.
This book will help you broaden your horizons by taking your programming skills to next level. The initial chapters will show you all about the environment that surrounds a developer at the start of a project. It introduces you to the new features that Swift 3 and Xcode 8 offers and also covers the common design patterns that you need to know for planning anything more than trivial projects. You will then learn the advanced Swift programming concepts, including memory management, generics, protocol orientated and functional programming and with this knowledge you will be able to tackle the next several chapters that deal with Apple's own Cocoa frameworks. It also covers AppKit, Foundation, and Core Data in detail which is a part of the Cocoa umbrella framework. The rest of the book will cover the challenges posed by asynchronous programming, error handling, debugging, and many other areas that are an indispensable part of producing software in a professional environment.
By the end of this book, you will be well acquainted with Swift, Cocoa, and AppKit, as well as a plethora of other essential tools, and you will be ready to tackle much more complex and advanced software projects.
