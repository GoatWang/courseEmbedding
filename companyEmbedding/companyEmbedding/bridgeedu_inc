Meant for More
Every scholar deserves the opportunity to succeed. At BridgeEdU we provide scholars with high-tech, high-touch solutions like our BridgeEdU On Campus program and our brand new YesU mobile app for financial aid planning. Our students are Meant for More. Are you?
 
On Campus Solution
The transition from high school to college can be a challenging time for our students. 
Not an alternative to college or a traditional ‘gap year’, BridgeEdU is a new on-ramp to success, providing students with a personalized, affordable program for a semester or for a year. Our students gain invaluable skills in and out of the classroom and earn transferable college credits.
We partner with universities to implement programs that significantly increase retention and graduation rates.
Learn More YesU Mobile App
We want students to understand the full cost of attending college and the myriad ways to maximize their aid.
BridgeEdU’s proprietary financial aid product, YesU is a dynamic and personalized mobile experience providing educational and motivational content leading students step by step through the four primary areas of college funding: federal aid, state aid, college grants and private scholarships.
YesU breaks down the daunting task of applying for financial aid, making it easier for students and parents to complete the process.

Our University Partners
Helping forge the future of higher education.
BridgeEdU works with universities and colleges to improve their retention and graduation rates. We provide in-person services for current and incoming students, fostering a supportive environment for them to thrive in college and beyond.

 Community College of Baltimore County
 Coppin State University
At CCBC, we realize that transitioning from high school to college can be a challenge for students who lack the necessary supports. Our partnership with BridgeEdu is a natural fit due to our shared strong commitment to student completion and success.
We appreciate BridgeEdu’s ability to address the varied needs of students from a holistic point of view. Providing assistance academically, financially and socially, we can work together to help all students achieve their academic and career potential.
Sandra L. Kurtinitis PhD, President, Community College of Baltimore CountyFrom day one [Coppin] started planning with the BridgeEdU team so that we could have not only the academics needed, but the services that BridgeEdU was going to provide, to make a whole prescription for the students and what they needed.
Read the full Baltimore Business Journal article
Dr. Maria Thompson, President, Coppin State UniversityOur investment in BridgeEdU supports an innovative social enterprise that provides intervention services to students and improves college retention among at-risk students starting in their first year of postsecondary attainment. This aligns well with Lumina’s equity imperative and college completion initiative, exemplifying the Foundation’s use of impact investing tools to drive mission.
Read the full Lumina Foundation article
Kiko Suarez, VP Communications and Innovation, Lumina FoundationOur latest public-private partnership is with BridgeEdU. It’s a company that was started by Wes Moore to help students in their first year who people would traditionally call underprepared. I don’t like to use that phrase, I like to say underserved or differently prepared.
His company and my university are partnering through a grant through Kaiser Permanente and some other private sources. The goal is that more students out of Baltimore City who were not thinking about, or in any way considering going to college, but absolutely have the talent with the right wraparound services can get into college and complete.Dr. Maria Thompson, President, Coppin State UniversityApply Now!
