History[edit]
On November 11, 1918, Quaker Chemical Corporation was founded as QUAKER OIL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. Its business consisted of the manufacture and sale of oil products, chiefly for lubrication and for the textile industry.
On October 20, 1930, Quaker reorganized and changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. The Company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During this time, Quaker expanded its scope with products for the metalworking industry. In 1947, Quaker entered into the steel market.
In August 1962, QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION to better suit the scope of its activities, which include process engineering and services, as well as the development, manufacture and sale of industrial specialty chemical products. What followed was the beginning of multiple company acquisitions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, Quaker established its first European subsidiary in the Netherlands. Quaker Chemical B.V. in Uithoorn manufactures and markets Quaker products to industries in the EEC. In 1964, Quaker expanded into Europe and formed a U.K. subsidiary Quaker Chemical Limited. Quaker also entered into a joint venture in Australia, Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited. In 1967, Quaker entered into a joint venture in Japan, Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. Finally, 1968 saw Quaker enter into a Joint venture in Mexico, TecniQuimia Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
On May 3, 1972, Quaker completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) making shares in the Company available to the public for the first time. The Mid-1970s saw the launch of the innovative QUINTOLUBRIC® polyol ester line of fluids. In June 1978, Quaker made its first major U.S. acquisition - Selby, Battersby & Co., a manufacturer of flooring systems for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings, and marine decking materials.
In 1987, Quaker enters the aerospace coating market with acquisition of AC Products, Inc. in California.
The 1990s saw Quaker expand into markets in France, China and Brazil and celebrate two milestones. First, in 1993, Quaker celebrated 75 years in business. The second saw Quaker file an application to list its common shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol KWR..[5] First NYSE trade occurs on August 23, 1996 for 100 shares. The decade was capped off with Quaker entering into a joint venture in India, Quaker Chemical India Limited.
On April 29, 2002, Quaker’s new corporate worldwide headquarters opened in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania - USA.
In 2002, Quaker acquired multiple assets including Quima International, LLC (forming Q2 Technologies, LLC), Epmar Corporation and Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Quaker continued with additional strategic acquisitions.
In 2010, Quaker entered the motorsports world by forming a partnership with the Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing (“SFHR”) team to develop new greases for IndyCar. In September 2012, Quaker debuted its new integrated marketing campaign “It’s what’s inside that counts” encompassing an updated brand identity, logo and tagline. The following year, Quaker launched a new website. In April 2014, Quaker launches CoolanTool™, a mobile application that facilitates the monitoring processes of metalworking fluids and organization of the data results in a number of ways.
From 2010 to the present, Quaker has continued its organic growth as well as made many global acquisitions including companies in the hot rolling business, specialty greases, surface treatments and die casting lubricants.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Quaker's subsidiaries include Summit Lubricants, AC Products Inc., Epmar, G.W. Smith and Sons, Tecniquimia Mexicana (Mexico), NP Coil Dexter (Italy), Q2Technologies, Kelko Quaker Chemical SA (Venezuela) and most recently ECLI Products, LLC. [6]
Operating Locations[edit]
Quaker has multiple operating locations in the Asia/Pacific region including Quaker Chemical (China) Co., Ltd. (Asia/Pacific Headquarters), Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited, Quaker Chemical India Limited, Nippon Quaker Chemical, LTD (Japan) and Quaker (Thailand) Ltd.
Quaker also has a significant presence in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region including Quaker Chemical B.V. (EMEA Headquarters, Netherlands), Quaker Chemical Limited (England), Quaker Chemical S.A. (France and Spain), Npcoil Dexter Industries S.r.l and Quaker Italia S.r.l, Moscow Representative Office of Quaker Chemical B.V. and two Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty.) locations.

Motorsports[edit]
Quaker is an official sponsor and technical partner of Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing. The partnership was formed to develop new greases that would reduce mechanical loss of energy and extend the life of the bearings. The brand has been involved in IndyCar racing since 2011. The driver of the SFHR No. 67 car is 22-year-old Josef Newgarden, the Firestone Indy Lights Series 2011 Champion.
Mobile App - CoolanTool[edit]
In 2014, Quaker Chemical released a mobile application called CoolanTool. The app provides a simple tool to monitor metalworking cutting fluids. Additionally, it allows to user to register CNC machines and keep track of coolant concentration and pH values displayed in graphs.
Advertising[edit]
It's What's Inside That Counts is the tagline of Quaker Chemical Corporation.[7] The logo was updated along with the tagline to depict fluid inside of a piece of manufacturing equipment. The logo and tagline has been used on most products and materials since the company rebranded itself in September 2012. The Quaker logo and color scheme is readily seen on the company's drum barrel.

History[edit]
On November 11, 1918, Quaker Chemical Corporation was founded as QUAKER OIL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. Its business consisted of the manufacture and sale of oil products, chiefly for lubrication and for the textile industry.
On October 20, 1930, Quaker reorganized and changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. The Company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During this time, Quaker expanded its scope with products for the metalworking industry. In 1947, Quaker entered into the steel market.
In August 1962, QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION to better suit the scope of its activities, which include process engineering and services, as well as the development, manufacture and sale of industrial specialty chemical products. What followed was the beginning of multiple company acquisitions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, Quaker established its first European subsidiary in the Netherlands. Quaker Chemical B.V. in Uithoorn manufactures and markets Quaker products to industries in the EEC. In 1964, Quaker expanded into Europe and formed a U.K. subsidiary Quaker Chemical Limited. Quaker also entered into a joint venture in Australia, Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited. In 1967, Quaker entered into a joint venture in Japan, Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. Finally, 1968 saw Quaker enter into a Joint venture in Mexico, TecniQuimia Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
On May 3, 1972, Quaker completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) making shares in the Company available to the public for the first time. The Mid-1970s saw the launch of the innovative QUINTOLUBRIC® polyol ester line of fluids. In June 1978, Quaker made its first major U.S. acquisition - Selby, Battersby & Co., a manufacturer of flooring systems for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings, and marine decking materials.
In 1987, Quaker enters the aerospace coating market with acquisition of AC Products, Inc. in California.
The 1990s saw Quaker expand into markets in France, China and Brazil and celebrate two milestones. First, in 1993, Quaker celebrated 75 years in business. The second saw Quaker file an application to list its common shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol KWR..[5] First NYSE trade occurs on August 23, 1996 for 100 shares. The decade was capped off with Quaker entering into a joint venture in India, Quaker Chemical India Limited.
On April 29, 2002, Quaker’s new corporate worldwide headquarters opened in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania - USA.
In 2002, Quaker acquired multiple assets including Quima International, LLC (forming Q2 Technologies, LLC), Epmar Corporation and Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Quaker continued with additional strategic acquisitions.
In 2010, Quaker entered the motorsports world by forming a partnership with the Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing (“SFHR”) team to develop new greases for IndyCar. In September 2012, Quaker debuted its new integrated marketing campaign “It’s what’s inside that counts” encompassing an updated brand identity, logo and tagline. The following year, Quaker launched a new website. In April 2014, Quaker launches CoolanTool™, a mobile application that facilitates the monitoring processes of metalworking fluids and organization of the data results in a number of ways.
From 2010 to the present, Quaker has continued its organic growth as well as made many global acquisitions including companies in the hot rolling business, specialty greases, surface treatments and die casting lubricants.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Quaker's subsidiaries include Summit Lubricants, AC Products Inc., Epmar, G.W. Smith and Sons, Tecniquimia Mexicana (Mexico), NP Coil Dexter (Italy), Q2Technologies, Kelko Quaker Chemical SA (Venezuela) and most recently ECLI Products, LLC. [6]

History[edit]
On November 11, 1918, Quaker Chemical Corporation was founded as QUAKER OIL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. Its business consisted of the manufacture and sale of oil products, chiefly for lubrication and for the textile industry.
On October 20, 1930, Quaker reorganized and changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. The Company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During this time, Quaker expanded its scope with products for the metalworking industry. In 1947, Quaker entered into the steel market.
In August 1962, QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION to better suit the scope of its activities, which include process engineering and services, as well as the development, manufacture and sale of industrial specialty chemical products. What followed was the beginning of multiple company acquisitions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, Quaker established its first European subsidiary in the Netherlands. Quaker Chemical B.V. in Uithoorn manufactures and markets Quaker products to industries in the EEC. In 1964, Quaker expanded into Europe and formed a U.K. subsidiary Quaker Chemical Limited. Quaker also entered into a joint venture in Australia, Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited. In 1967, Quaker entered into a joint venture in Japan, Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. Finally, 1968 saw Quaker enter into a Joint venture in Mexico, TecniQuimia Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
On May 3, 1972, Quaker completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) making shares in the Company available to the public for the first time. The Mid-1970s saw the launch of the innovative QUINTOLUBRIC® polyol ester line of fluids. In June 1978, Quaker made its first major U.S. acquisition - Selby, Battersby & Co., a manufacturer of flooring systems for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings, and marine decking materials.
In 1987, Quaker enters the aerospace coating market with acquisition of AC Products, Inc. in California.
The 1990s saw Quaker expand into markets in France, China and Brazil and celebrate two milestones. First, in 1993, Quaker celebrated 75 years in business. The second saw Quaker file an application to list its common shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol KWR..[5] First NYSE trade occurs on August 23, 1996 for 100 shares. The decade was capped off with Quaker entering into a joint venture in India, Quaker Chemical India Limited.
On April 29, 2002, Quaker’s new corporate worldwide headquarters opened in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania - USA.
In 2002, Quaker acquired multiple assets including Quima International, LLC (forming Q2 Technologies, LLC), Epmar Corporation and Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Quaker continued with additional strategic acquisitions.
In 2010, Quaker entered the motorsports world by forming a partnership with the Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing (“SFHR”) team to develop new greases for IndyCar. In September 2012, Quaker debuted its new integrated marketing campaign “It’s what’s inside that counts” encompassing an updated brand identity, logo and tagline. The following year, Quaker launched a new website. In April 2014, Quaker launches CoolanTool™, a mobile application that facilitates the monitoring processes of metalworking fluids and organization of the data results in a number of ways.
From 2010 to the present, Quaker has continued its organic growth as well as made many global acquisitions including companies in the hot rolling business, specialty greases, surface treatments and die casting lubricants.

History[edit]
On November 11, 1918, Quaker Chemical Corporation was founded as QUAKER OIL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. Its business consisted of the manufacture and sale of oil products, chiefly for lubrication and for the textile industry.
On October 20, 1930, Quaker reorganized and changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. The Company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During this time, Quaker expanded its scope with products for the metalworking industry. In 1947, Quaker entered into the steel market.
In August 1962, QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION to better suit the scope of its activities, which include process engineering and services, as well as the development, manufacture and sale of industrial specialty chemical products. What followed was the beginning of multiple company acquisitions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, Quaker established its first European subsidiary in the Netherlands. Quaker Chemical B.V. in Uithoorn manufactures and markets Quaker products to industries in the EEC. In 1964, Quaker expanded into Europe and formed a U.K. subsidiary Quaker Chemical Limited. Quaker also entered into a joint venture in Australia, Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited. In 1967, Quaker entered into a joint venture in Japan, Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. Finally, 1968 saw Quaker enter into a Joint venture in Mexico, TecniQuimia Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
On May 3, 1972, Quaker completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) making shares in the Company available to the public for the first time. The Mid-1970s saw the launch of the innovative QUINTOLUBRIC® polyol ester line of fluids. In June 1978, Quaker made its first major U.S. acquisition - Selby, Battersby & Co., a manufacturer of flooring systems for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings, and marine decking materials.
In 1987, Quaker enters the aerospace coating market with acquisition of AC Products, Inc. in California.
The 1990s saw Quaker expand into markets in France, China and Brazil and celebrate two milestones. First, in 1993, Quaker celebrated 75 years in business. The second saw Quaker file an application to list its common shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol KWR..[5] First NYSE trade occurs on August 23, 1996 for 100 shares. The decade was capped off with Quaker entering into a joint venture in India, Quaker Chemical India Limited.
On April 29, 2002, Quaker’s new corporate worldwide headquarters opened in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania - USA.
In 2002, Quaker acquired multiple assets including Quima International, LLC (forming Q2 Technologies, LLC), Epmar Corporation and Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Quaker continued with additional strategic acquisitions.
In 2010, Quaker entered the motorsports world by forming a partnership with the Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing (“SFHR”) team to develop new greases for IndyCar. In September 2012, Quaker debuted its new integrated marketing campaign “It’s what’s inside that counts” encompassing an updated brand identity, logo and tagline. The following year, Quaker launched a new website. In April 2014, Quaker launches CoolanTool™, a mobile application that facilitates the monitoring processes of metalworking fluids and organization of the data results in a number of ways.
From 2010 to the present, Quaker has continued its organic growth as well as made many global acquisitions including companies in the hot rolling business, specialty greases, surface treatments and die casting lubricants.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Quaker's subsidiaries include Summit Lubricants, AC Products Inc., Epmar, G.W. Smith and Sons, Tecniquimia Mexicana (Mexico), NP Coil Dexter (Italy), Q2Technologies, Kelko Quaker Chemical SA (Venezuela) and most recently ECLI Products, LLC. [6]

Quaker has multiple operating locations in the Asia/Pacific region including Quaker Chemical (China) Co., Ltd. (Asia/Pacific Headquarters), Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited, Quaker Chemical India Limited, Nippon Quaker Chemical, LTD (Japan) and Quaker (Thailand) Ltd.
Quaker also has a significant presence in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region including Quaker Chemical B.V.

Motorsports[edit]
Quaker is an official sponsor and technical partner of Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing. The partnership was formed to develop new greases that would reduce mechanical loss of energy and extend the life of the bearings. The brand has been involved in IndyCar racing since 2011. The driver of the SFHR No. 67 car is 22-year-old Josef Newgarden, the Firestone Indy Lights Series 2011 Champion.
Mobile App - CoolanTool[edit]
In 2014, Quaker Chemical released a mobile application called CoolanTool. The app provides a simple tool to monitor metalworking cutting fluids. Additionally, it allows to user to register CNC machines and keep track of coolant concentration and pH values displayed in graphs.
Advertising[edit]
It's What's Inside That Counts is the tagline of Quaker Chemical Corporation.[7] The logo was updated along with the tagline to depict fluid inside of a piece of manufacturing equipment. The logo and tagline has been used on most products and materials since the company rebranded itself in September 2012. The Quaker logo and color scheme is readily seen on the company's drum barrel.

History[edit]
On November 11, 1918, Quaker Chemical Corporation was founded as QUAKER OIL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. Its business consisted of the manufacture and sale of oil products, chiefly for lubrication and for the textile industry.
On October 20, 1930, Quaker reorganized and changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION. The Company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During this time, Quaker expanded its scope with products for the metalworking industry. In 1947, Quaker entered into the steel market.
In August 1962, QUAKER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION changed its name to QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION to better suit the scope of its activities, which include process engineering and services, as well as the development, manufacture and sale of industrial specialty chemical products. What followed was the beginning of multiple company acquisitions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, Quaker established its first European subsidiary in the Netherlands. Quaker Chemical B.V. in Uithoorn manufactures and markets Quaker products to industries in the EEC. In 1964, Quaker expanded into Europe and formed a U.K. subsidiary Quaker Chemical Limited. Quaker also entered into a joint venture in Australia, Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited. In 1967, Quaker entered into a joint venture in Japan, Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. Finally, 1968 saw Quaker enter into a Joint venture in Mexico, TecniQuimia Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
On May 3, 1972, Quaker completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) making shares in the Company available to the public for the first time. The Mid-1970s saw the launch of the innovative QUINTOLUBRIC® polyol ester line of fluids. In June 1978, Quaker made its first major U.S. acquisition - Selby, Battersby & Co., a manufacturer of flooring systems for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings, and marine decking materials.
In 1987, Quaker enters the aerospace coating market with acquisition of AC Products, Inc. in California.
The 1990s saw Quaker expand into markets in France, China and Brazil and celebrate two milestones. First, in 1993, Quaker celebrated 75 years in business. The second saw Quaker file an application to list its common shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol KWR..[5] First NYSE trade occurs on August 23, 1996 for 100 shares. The decade was capped off with Quaker entering into a joint venture in India, Quaker Chemical India Limited.
On April 29, 2002, Quaker’s new corporate worldwide headquarters opened in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania - USA.
In 2002, Quaker acquired multiple assets including Quima International, LLC (forming Q2 Technologies, LLC), Epmar Corporation and Quaker Chemical South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Quaker continued with additional strategic acquisitions.
In 2010, Quaker entered the motorsports world by forming a partnership with the Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing (“SFHR”) team to develop new greases for IndyCar. In September 2012, Quaker debuted its new integrated marketing campaign “It’s what’s inside that counts” encompassing an updated brand identity, logo and tagline. The following year, Quaker launched a new website. In April 2014, Quaker launches CoolanTool™, a mobile application that facilitates the monitoring processes of metalworking fluids and organization of the data results in a number of ways.
From 2010 to the present, Quaker has continued its organic growth as well as made many global acquisitions including companies in the hot rolling business, specialty greases, surface treatments and die casting lubricants.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Quaker's subsidiaries include Summit Lubricants, AC Products Inc., Epmar, G.W. Smith and Sons, Tecniquimia Mexicana (Mexico), NP Coil Dexter (Italy), Q2Technologies, Kelko Quaker Chemical SA (Venezuela) and most recently ECLI Products, LLC. [6]
Operating Locations[edit]
Quaker has multiple operating locations in the Asia/Pacific region including Quaker Chemical (China) Co., Ltd. (Asia/Pacific Headquarters), Quaker Chemical (Australasia) Pty. Limited, Quaker Chemical India Limited, Nippon Quaker Chemical, LTD (Japan) and Quaker (Thailand) Ltd.
Quaker also has a significant presence in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region including Quaker Chemical B.V. (EMEA Headquarters, Netherlands), Quaker Chemical Limited (England), Quaker Chemical S.A.

Motorsports[edit]
Quaker is an official sponsor and technical partner of Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing. The partnership was formed to develop new greases that would reduce mechanical loss of energy and extend the life of the bearings. The brand has been involved in IndyCar racing since 2011. The driver of the SFHR No. 67 car is 22-year-old Josef Newgarden, the Firestone Indy Lights Series 2011 Champion.
Mobile App - CoolanTool[edit]
In 2014, Quaker Chemical released a mobile application called CoolanTool. The app provides a simple tool to monitor metalworking cutting fluids. Additionally, it allows to user to register CNC machines and keep track of coolant concentration and pH values displayed in graphs.
Advertising[edit]
It's What's Inside That Counts is the tagline of Quaker Chemical Corporation.[7] The logo was updated along with the tagline to depict fluid inside of a piece of manufacturing equipment. The logo and tagline has been used on most products and materials since the company rebranded itself in September 2012. The Quaker logo and color scheme is readily seen on the company's drum barrel.

Industrial Lubricants
PRODUCTS

MINETECH™

Specialty high performance lubricants specifically engineered for the Mining environment.
 
Featured MINETECH™ products include:
 
CST Drive Synthetic Gear Oils – MINETECH™ CST 100
Recommended for highly loaded enclosed gearing as well as plain and rolling element bearings. This shear stable lubricant resists damage to gear teeth caused by repeated shock loads, and is ideal for wind turbine gearboxes, mine hoist gearboxes, crane gearing, and other enclosed gearing which requires micro-pitting resistance.
 

 
Synthetic Gear Oils – MINETECH™ EP
A series of gear lubricants formulated with synthetic PAO base fluids proven to reduce friction, thus reducing the input power to operate the equipment or increasing the available power output. The reduction of fluid friction results in lower lubricant operating temperatures, extending the life of both the lubricant and the equipment. These products were developed for the lubrication of enclosed gears, which are heavily loaded (plain or roller element).
 

 
Semi-Fluid Synthetic Gear Oils and Greases – MINETECH™ LST-0-EP
Designed for various industrial gear applications, it is formulated to reduce fluid related problems and should be used in extreme conditions where a conventional gear lubricant may not offer sufficient lubrication. Due to the semi-solid being active when the product is stationary and not being sheared it will not leak out of the gearbox. The product itself seals in the lubricant and seals out the contaminants. This also offers resistance to water incursion and provides superior protection against corrosion and oxidation, which can eat away and destroy critical components and lead to equipment failure.
 

PROTECH™

High performance synthetic Metalworking fluids designed for various industrial and air compressor applications.
 
Featured PROTECH™ products include:
 
Synthetic Air Compressor Lubricants – PROTECH™ AC Series
Lubricants manufactured from the highest quality PAO (polyalphaolefin) base fluids and incorporate advanced additive technology. PROTECH AC Series lubricants offer many advantages over petroleum-based lubricants as well as some synthetics – especially where compatibility is an important concern.
 
Recommended applications include centrifugal compressors, rotary screw compressors, ball and roller element bearings, low temperature lubrication and high temperature lubrication.
 

 
Synthetic Gear Lubricants – PROTECH™ EP Series
Synthetic gear lubricants formulated with synthetic (PAO) base fluids and fortified with select additive systems to enhance their exceptional performance. The PAO base fluid has excellent oxidation and thermal stability, a naturally high viscosity index and excellent low temperature pumpability and fluidity. The additive system provides increased oxidation stability, extreme pressure properties, and maximum protection against wear, rust, corrosion and foaming.
 
QUAKER PROTECH™ EP Series synthetic gear lubricants have proven to reduce friction, reducing the input power to operate the equipment or increasing the available power output. The reduction of fluid friction results in lower lubricant operating temperatures, extending the life of both the lubricant and the equipment.

QUAKER CIRCULATING OIL

A series of products containing high quality, high viscosity index oils, recommended for the lubrication of oil-film bearings on back-up rolls in metal rolling mills.  They are designed to meet the specifications of bearing manufacturers.

QUAKERVIS™

A complete line of hydraulic fluid formulated from high-quality base oils and carefully selected additive systems to offer outstanding thermal stability.  QUAKERVIS™ oils are available in both zinc containing and ashless (zinc free) versions.

QUAKERWAY™

Premium line of way oils that incorporates a unique tackiness additive and a high performance lubricant additive system.  

ULTRAGEAR™

Industrial Gear Lubricants – ULTRAGEAR™ EP Series
Premium gear lubricants formulated with high quality base oils and an effective sulfur-phosphorous EP (extreme pressure) additive system designed to minimize wear of enclosed gears and other equipment operating under heavy loads and shock conditions. They utilize high viscosity index (HVI) base oils that impart high flash points, low volatility, and superior oxidation stability. They provide outstanding protection in industrial gear sets operating under severe conditions such as intermittent shock loads, high peak loads, and heavy tooth loads.
 

 
Food Grade Gear Oils
