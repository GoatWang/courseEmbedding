Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background  

The Eco-Products Fund will be jointly managed by Equator Environmental LLC and New Forests Inc.  Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:  implementing partners, best practices information.
OFFERING:  financial resources, implementing partners, best practices information, media and marketing assistance.


Progress Reports

July 2008
The current flagship program of the commitment is the Duck's Unlimited Avoided Grassland Conversion Project in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The goal of the DU Avoided Grassland Conversion project is to protect the Prairie Pothole Region (of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana) by placing perpetual conservation easements to avoid conversion to cropping. The Project aims to protect 30,000 acres by the end of 2009.
Milestones Reached:
- Currently, over 10,000 acres have been placed under easement or are pending acceptance by the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
- To date, the National Fish and Wildlife Service has never rejected any of Equator Environmental's proposed easements.

Webinar: Lessons learnt on the journey to Product Management
 










































































 











 


























  





















Lessons learnt on the journey to Product Management 




				How TUI shifted their focus from a project to product approach			








WEBINAR – 5th April 2017 














  











TUI Group are the largest leisure, travel and tourism company in the world, made up of tour operators, hotels, airlines, and cruise ships.
Like many organizations today, TUI Group recognized the need to shift their focus from a projects to product approach, by raising the skills bar for their product managers and looking at organizational alignment between business and technology.
Watch the webinar to hear the benefits that TUI are experiencing from making the change.








 







We received some more questions during and after the webinar. Have a look below to see the responses:
Can you give a few examples of TUI’s digital products?
All our websites and mobile apps, CRM and customer management systems, Marketing automation platform, Knowledge management and collaboration platforms. Basically if it’s delivered through technology and has a need for constant evolution and launch of new features/capabilities, it’s a product.
Does this signal the end of projects in TUI?
There will always be projects but we expect they will become the exception. They are generally enabling initiatives that have a very clear deliverable end date before going into a ‘business as usual’ management. A good example is a recent update to our procurement or finance systems.
Are you adopting a fail fast approach?
Yes we are. Through the product management approach we have adopted with Emergn, one of the tools we use is an Assumptions Matrix. Product managers are expected to design experiments to validate their underlying assumptions. Where assumptions are found to be incorrect we then revisit the overall value proposition to either adapt it or to bin it.
Are teams co-located for the 10 weeks?
Ideally yes but this is not always pragmatic. Product managers are expected to create the best collaboration environment they can within the real-world constraints. We do encourage pushing against constraints to see if they are real of just perceived.
What will be the differences between introducing and then scaling this change?
We are confident that the value of the product management approach has proven it can work well within TUI. There are however processes that need to be re-designed to enable the approach to scale. We also recognize that we need to scale education beyond product managers to the leadership and other functions. We are also planning to use Emergn’s online delivery offering to help reach a broader audience.
How does TUI map complex customer needs to product as well as business drivers?
To cut a long story short, we’re ruthless when it comes to breaking down needs/benefits into bitesized chunks and then prioritizing. The customer needs are typically identified through detailed customer insight (both qualitative and quantitative). Business drivers are simpler as everything needs to deliver against core KPIs and we deliver the most valuable first. All of these tasks sit within the Product function – we’re expected to know our customers inside-out and be able to match their needs with business outcomes whilst ensuring we deliver the most valuable first.
…Particularly when it is constantly evolving (business as well as customer needs as well)?
This is where you need experience in delivering at pace. We’ll test ideas/opportunities early on and quantify the benefit through a lean canvas. This is a very quick and easy way of testing the scale of the opportunity and we’ll often quickly hack together Proof of Concepts to better understand technical difficulty. Covering this up-front helps us feed into prioritization so we’re constantly building the most valuable features as quickly as possible.
Please explain what you mean by the ‘VFQ Product Management Pathway’.
The VFQ Product Management Pathway and online course helps learners to bring ideas to life, from their generation to the development of prototypes, MVPs, and market-ready propositions. It offers a structured process that uses theory and templates to drive action on challenges that are real to the learner. It guides learners through the latest thinking and how to implement it to build great products.
Value, Flow, Quality (VFQ) is an action-learning education program focused on outcomes. Our philosophy is based on the idea that different people learn in different ways, and that the most impactful learning happens when people understand things and then get to apply those concepts directly in their own work.
If you have more questions about the webinar, please feel free to email us.
