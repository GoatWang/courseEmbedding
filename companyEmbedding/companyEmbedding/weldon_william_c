Early life and education[edit]
He was born in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were a Broadway stagehand and a costume designer. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in biology from Quinnipiac University in 1971.[3]
Career[edit]
He spent his entire working life at Johnson & Johnson. He joined the company as a sales representative for the McNeil Pharameutical division in 1971 and eventually became the head of Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Endo-Surgery business in 1992. He became the head of Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical operations in 1998 and then became the company's chief executive officer (CEO) in 2002. As CEO, Weldon engineered some of the largest acquisitions in the company's history including the purchase of Alza and Pfizer's consumer-health product line.[4][5]
In 2009, he earned a total compensation of $22,830,834, which included a base salary of $1,802,500, a cash bonus of $12,831,146, stock awards of $2,762,532, option awards of $5,238,069, and other compensation of $196,587.[6] In 2011, The New York Times named him on its list of "The Worst C.E.O.'s of 2011" for the increased number of Johnson & Johnson product recalls under his leadership.[7] Additionally, as of 2013, his story was a case study at the Leadership & Corporate Accountability course at Harvard Business School.[8]
In Weldon's first full year as the company's CEO, total revenues increased from $32.3 billion to $36.3 billion and net earnings from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion.[9] In 2011, his last full year as CEO, revenues were $44.7 billion and net earnings were $9.7 billion.[10]
Weldon retired as chairman of Johnson & Johnson on December 28, 2012, and was reported to receive $143.5 million in retirement pay.[11]

The median pay package for C.E.O.’s at big public companies declined last year, to $7.7 million. Many critics would say that’s still overpaying.















                    Rivals Gird For Battle On Guidant                
Battle lines have been drawn in the fight for control of Guidant, the medical device maker whose crown jewel is its strong position in the huge and fast-growing market for heart-regulating implants. Johnson & Johnson, responding yesterday to Boston Scientific's unexpected $25 billion bid for Guidant on Monday, asserted that the $21.5 billion merger agreement it reached with Guidant on Nov. 15 represented ''full and fair value.''











                    From Band-Aids To Biotech                
FOR generations, Johnson & Johnson has been known for Band-Aids and baby powder. It invented the first-aid kit and created the universally recognized scent of a baby. But these days, the fortunes of New Jersey's largest company lie not as much in the nursery or drug store aisle as in high-tech medical devices and biotech drugs -- at once a more lucrative but riskier path. Johnson & Johnson, a mixed bag of 200 operating companies with combined sales of $47.3 billion last year, markets everything from Neutrogena and Aveeno skin creams to over-the-counter medicines like Imodium, Tylenol and Motrin to Reach toothbrushes, Stayfree Maxipads and the sugar substitute Splenda.

Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical and health care giant, announced late last night that it had agreed to buy Guidant, one of the nation's largest makers of devices to treat heart and circulatory illnesses, for $25.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $76 in cash and stock for each share of Guidant, a company that was spun off from Eli Lilly in 1994. Slightly more than a third of the offer is said to be in cash.











                    Private Sector; From the Ranks, Unassumingly                
BILL WELDON is the kind of guy who says he never really had his eye on the chairman's job at Johnson & Johnson, the global health care giant, and you almost believe him. But that is the job that will soon be handed to Mr. Weldon, a plain-speaking son of a Broadway stagehand and a seamstress, who has spent virtually his entire working life at the company. ''I'm one of those people who believe if you do what's right, things will work out,'' Mr. Weldon, now a vice chairman, said recently as he sat in his office in the Tower, as the company's 14-story hospital-white headquarters here is known.











                    J.& J. Chief Retiring; Company and Merck Post Profit Gains

Weldon, an executive who began his 30-year career as a sales representative. Also yesterday, both Johnson & Johnson and a big competitor, Merck, posted fourth-quarter profit increases.

      ■ William Weldon, who went to work for Johnson & Johnson
      (J&J) fresh out of college in 1971, assumed leadership of the
      international health-care giant in April 2002. Weldon became only the
      sixth chairman in the company's 116-year history and took on the
      daunting challenge of leading one of America's most consistently
      successful companies into the 21st century. In Weldon's first full
      year as chairman and chief executive

      officer, J&J posted a profit of nearly $7.2 billion on worldwide
      sales of just under $41.9 billion. This represented an increase of roughly
      9.1 percent in net income and a 15.3 percent increase in total revenue. In
      leading J&J to yet another sales increase, Weldon honored a long
      tradition of the company, which had not seen a revenue decline in more
      than 70 years.
    

      Although Weldon spent his entire working life with J&J, he first
      attracted widespread attention in the spring of 2001 when, as vice
      chairman and head of the company's pharmaceu ticals group, he
      engineered the takeover of Alza Corporation in what was then J&J
      biggest acquisition ever. Alza, which became a member of the J&J
      family but continued to operate under its own name, specializes in the
      development of drug-delivery systems, primarily transdermal patches.
      Analysts viewed the Alza deal favorably. Jerry I. Treppel, an analyst with
       Bank of America Securities, told Carey Krause of 
      
        Chemical Market Reporter
      
       that J&J's acquisition of Alza's Concerta, Ditropan
      XL, and Doxil pharmaceuticals would provide "high-margin,
      high-growth, new pharmaceutical revenues." Equally positive in his
      assessment of the deal was David Lothson, an analyst with UBS Warburg, who
      told Krause, "The acquisition makes terrific sense for J&J
      and is being done at a price that is attractive for both sets of
      shareholders" (April 2, 2001).
    

      J&J BEST KNOWN FOR BAND-AIDS AND TYLENOL
    

      Johnson & Johnson, headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is
      perhaps best known to consumers as the company behind such everyday
      health-care standbys as Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol, and Johnson's
      Baby Powder. But J&J is, in fact, a family of more than two hundred
      operating companies in countries around the globe. Its workforce numbers
      more than 110,000, about half of whom work in the United States. Founded
      by Robert Wood Johnson in 1886, the company was family-owned until 1944
      when its stock was first offered on the New York Stock Exchange. Although
      the company is immediately recognizable to the public for its popular
      over-the-counter health-care products, it also developed and markets such
      top-selling prescription drugs as Procrit (marketed as Eprex in Europe)
      for anemia, Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis, Risperdal for
      schizophrenia, and Topamax for epilepsy.
    

      The son of a Broadway stagehand and a costume seamstress who both worked
      in the New York theater, Weldon was born in Brooklyn, New York, on
      November 26, 1948. The family later moved to nearby northern New Jersey,
      where young Weldon attended Ridgewood High School. A student of no
      particular distinction during his high-school years, Weldon excelled at
      athletics and played on the basketball and football teams. After
      graduating from high school in 1967, Weldon enrolled at Quinnipiac
      University in Hamden, Connecticut, to study biology. Midway through
      college, he married Barbara Dearborn, whom he met while in high school,
      after which, he told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , he grew more serious about his studies.
    

      After earning his bachelor's degree in 1971, Weldon inter-viewed
      for a job as sales representative with J&J's McNeil
      Pharmaceutical unit, which is now known as Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. He
      was interviewed by Howard Klick, who three decades later told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       that as part of the process he challenged Weldon to give him a sales
      pitch on a ballpoint pen. "He was hungry," recalled Klick.
      "He had fire in the belly" (May 5, 2003). Klick said the
      young college graduate outdid himself in selling the pen to his
      interviewer, taking it apart to demonstrate how it worked and extolling
      its writing properties. Klick hired him on the spot.
    

      MOVES QUICKLY UP THE LADDER AT MCNEIL
    

      After a couple of years as a sales representative, Weldon began climbing
      the ladder at McNeil, taking on a series of marketing management positions
      of increasing responsibility. In 1982 he was named manager of
      J&J's ICOM Regional Development Center in Southeast Asia, a
      post he held until 1984, when he was named executive vice president and
      managing director of Korea McNeil. Two years later Weldon was named
      executive vice president and managing director of Ortho-Cilag
      Pharmaceutical in the United Kingdom. In 1989 he returned to the United
      States as vice president for sales and marketing of J&J's
      Janssen Pharmaceutica.
    

      In 1992 Weldon was appointed president of Ethicon Endo-Surgery (EES), a
      newly created J&J company specializing in the development and
      marketing of surgical instruments and related medical devices used in both
      minimally invasive and traditional surgery. This was a change for Weldon,
      whose previous J&J experience had been in the pharmaceutical end of
      the business. But he adapted quickly. J&J had big plans for EES and
      decided that Weldon was the man to help lead the fledgling company into a
      leadership position in the field of endoscopic surgery, an area of medical
      therapy with a vast potential for growth. As J&J infused the new
      company with millions to get it off the ground, Weldon worked doggedly to
      make EES a major force in the medical-instruments market.
    

      To develop new products, Weldon brought in a large number of engineers and
      equipped them with cutting-edge computer-aided design (CAD) systems. He
      also called on expert counsel from the Harvard Business School to help EES
      put in place a multifunctional, team-based environment that was able to
      sharply reduce the time it took to develop new products. To market its
      rapidly growing product line, the company hired a worldwide force of two
      hundred sales representatives. In a little over a decade the size of the
      EES sales team roughly tripled.
    

      WELDON GROWS EES MARKET SHARE
    

      Weldon spearheaded EES's drive for market share, traveling
      extensively to discuss the company's products with surgeons and
      hospital administrators. According to 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , he delayed a flight from San Diego back to EES's Cincinnati
      headquarters so that he could further press his company's case with
      a potential customer who was having second thoughts about committing to
      EES products. During his years with EES, Weldon earned a reputation for
      setting even higher goals for the company than the top managers back at
      J&J headquarters in New Brunswick. As Nick Valeriani, vice
      president of sales and marketing for EES, told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , "We'd have a great year and Bill would say, 'Nice
      job. Why couldn't it have been 25 percent higher?'"
      (May 5, 2003).
    

      Weldon's hard work paid off. Under his direction, by 1996 EES had
      propelled itself into the market leadership position
       in both endoscopic and traditional surgical instruments, surpassing
      United States Surgical Corporation, the previous market leader. Although
      Weldon was a hard taskmaster at EES, he also ensured that his
      best-performing employees at the J&J subsidiary were amply rewarded
      and, thus, better able to resist the temptation of offers to go elsewhere.
      Not everyone flourished under Weldon's style of leadership. Those
      who failed to adequately convince him of their willingness to be team
      players, according to 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , felt alienated by Weldon. Of his former boss at EES, one former
      executive told the magazine that Weldon was "an intimidator and a
      dominator" (May 5, 2003).
    

      In 1995, three years after he joined the newly founded EES as its
      president, Weldon was named a J&J company group chairman and the
      worldwide franchise chairman of EES. Three years later he returned to the
      pharmaceutical side of the company as worldwide chairman of
      J&J's Pharmaceuticals Group and a member of the
      company's executive committee.
    

      J&J PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS LAGS
    

      In the late 1990s J&J's pharmaceuticals business badly
      needed a shot in the arm. In 1998 five promising drugs on which the
      Pharmaceuticals Group was pinning much of its hopes for the future were
      shot down in the late stages of development. According to a report by
      Robert Langreth in 
      
        Forbes
      
      , new J&J medications for the treatment of stroke and diabetes
      failed in large-scale human trials, while drugs designed to combat
      multiple sclerosis and premature labor were rejected by federal
      regulators. To make matters even worse, J&J lost in a battle over
      the rights to a new formulation of Procrit, its bestselling anemia
      medication. Impressed by what Weldon had done at EES, Ralph Larsen, then
      chairman and CEO of J&J, hoped the Brooklyn native could find a way
      to reinvigorate the giant company's pharmaceuticals business.
    

      Weldon moved quickly to get the pharmaceuticals business moving again. By
      the end of 1999 he had helped engineer J&J's purchase of
      Centocor, a Malvern, Pennsylvania, biotechnology company that had within
      its product line three drugs of particular interest to J&J. Heading
      the list was Remicade, which was already being marketed for the treatment
      of Crohn's disease and was expected to soon receive approval for
      treating rheumatoid arthritis. The other two drugs were Reo-Pro, an
      anticlotting medication, and Retavase, a form of tissue plasminogen
      activator (tPA) used in the early treatment of heart attacks. J&J
      was also attracted by Centocor's position as the world's
      leading producer of monoclonal antibodies, technology that could be used
      as a platform for a wide variety of potential applications. The Centocor
      deal was valued at roughly $5 billion.
    

      In February 2001 J&J's board of directors elected Weldon and
      James T. Lenehan, worldwide chairman of J&J's Medical
      Devices & Diagnostics Group, vice chairmen of the corporation.
      Under terms of their new appointments, Weldon and Lenehan joined
      J&J's chairman and CEO Larsen and senior vice chairman
      Robert N. Wilson in the Office of the Chairman, J&J's top
      management group. In his new position Weldon continued to be responsible
      for the Pharmaceuticals Group and the Consumer Pharmaceuticals &
      Nutritional Products Group but was given the additional tasks of
      overseeing corporate-business development and the Corporate Office of
      Science & Technology.
    

      ENGINEERS J&J'S ACQUISITION OF ALZA
    

      Less than two months after taking over as a corporate vice chairman,
      Weldon announced an agreement to acquire Alza Corporation, headquartered
      in Mountain View, California. Ernest Mario, Alza's chairman and
      CEO, told Paul Jacobs of the 
      
        San Jose Mercury News
      
       that he and Weldon had begun talks only a month earlier about
      "putting the two businesses together to reach more patients with
      our products" (March 28, 2001). Under the terms of the acquisition
      agreement, Alza was to continue operations under its own name from its
      California base. Weldon said he expected that the merger would create for
      Alza more markets for its pharmaceutical products as well as new
      applications within the larger J&J family for the company's
      drug-delivery systems. The latter segment of Alza's product line
      included transdermal patches, which deliver measured dosages of medication
      through the skin, implants, and time-release capsules.
    

      On January 22, 2002, seven months to the day after J&J finalized
      its acquisition of Alza, Larsen announced that after 13 years at the helm
      of J&J he was stepping down and would be succeeded as chairman and
      CEO by Weldon, effective April 25, 2002. Larsen stayed on for a few months
      after passing the torch to Weldon but left the company completely on July
      1, 2002. At the same time Weldon was named to succeed Larsen, the company
      announced that Jim Lenehan, Weldon's fellow vice chairman, would
      become J&J's president, succeeding Robert Wilson.
    

      In assessing the task that lay ahead of him, Weldon told Lewis Krauskopf
      of the 
      
        Bergen Record
      
       that "the challenges are going to be to build on the outstanding
      record that Ralph [Larsen] has built going forward" (January 23,
      2002). Weldon singled out the regulatory environment as one of the more
      daunting challenges facing not only J&J but the health-care
      industry as a whole. He pointed to the insistence by federal officials on
      broader studies with greater numbers of subjects before giving the green
      light to new drugs.
    

      A CLUE TO J&J'S FUTURE?
    

      Although Weldon said that J&J's widely diversified product
      base would serve it well in the future, many outside observers
       speculated that the selection of the head of its Pharmaceuticals Group to
      lead the company offered a clue to the direction in which the company was
      moving, at least in the short term. Analysts observed that Weldon's
      selection made sense in view of the large investments J&J had made
      in its acquisitions of both Centocor and Alza.
    

      Industry observers agreed, however, that Weldon's biggest challenge
      would be maintaining healthy earnings growth at J&J, a task made
      progressively more daunting as the company's revenue base continued
      to expand. The company's performance in 2002, two-thirds of which
      occurred on Weldon's watch, was reassuring for J&J
      stockholders. The company posted net income of nearly $6.6 billion on
      sales of roughly $36.3 billion. Diluted earnings per share in 2002 came in
      at $2.16, compared with $1.84 a year earlier. This represented an increase
      in earnings per share of about 17.4 percent, continuing
      J&J's lengthy string of double-digit annual earnings gains.
    

      Under Weldon's direction, J&J continued to grow through
      acquisition. By far the biggest purchase during Weldon's first 18
      months as CEO came with the news in February 2003 that J&J had
      outbid two other major pharmaceutical companies for Scios, a major force
      in the biotechnology industry headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.
      Although the CEO of Scios, Richard B. Brewer, declined to reveal the names
      of the other suitors to the 
      
        San Jose Mercury News
      
      , he made it clear that J&J's all-cash offer of $2.4 billion
      was too good to turn down. The deal represented further expansion into the
      bio-technology field by J&J and brought into the company's
      growing family of life-saving drugs Natrecor, a genetically engineered
      medication developed by Scios for the treatment of patients with
      congestive heart failure. Under the terms of the acquisition, Scios would
      continue to operate under its own name in Sunnyvale.
    

      SMALLER ACQUISITIONS MADE
    

      Although they were dwarfed by the Scios deal, J&J made two smaller
      acquisitions before the end of 2003. In November 2002 the company
      announced its plan to purchase OraPharma, a small drug company in
      Warminster, Pennsylvania. Ora-Pharma developed Arestin, a time-release
      antibiotic used in the treatment of gum disease. Two months later
      J&J announced that it was acquiring 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals,
      which had developed technologies that J&J researchers felt could be
      used to enhance the larger company's drug-research capabilities.
    

      In early 2004 Weldon announced J&J net income of $7.2 billion on
      sales of $41.9 billion for 2003. Diluted earnings per share for the year
      were $2.40 in 2003, up 11.1 percent from the previous year. Particularly
      impressive was the company's performance in the final quarter of
      2003, when earnings jumped 33 percent to 62¢ per share from
      46¢ in the comparable period a year earlier. Of the
      company's impressive showing, Weldon told the Associated Press that
      "each of our business segments made important contributions to the
      overall growth while continuing to invest in building our businesses for
      the future" (
      
        AP Online
      
      , January 20, 2004).
    

      Weldon and his wife, Barbara, lived in Somerset County, New Jersey, not
      far from J&J's headquarters in New Brunswick. The couple had
      a daughter and a son. According to a profile of Weldon in 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , the J&J CEO maintained a strong interest in basketball. He
      reportedly insisted on the last-minute addition of a basketball court to
      plans for a new J&J facility. In November 2003 Weldon was elected
      treasurer of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. He
      was also a member of the Business Council and served on the board of
      trustees of Quinnipiac University, his alma mater.

      Sidelights
    

      William Weldon worked his way from the lowest ranks of Johnson &
      Johnson, the well-known name associated with such products as baby shampoo
      and bandages, to become the sixth chief executive officer (CEO) and
      chairman of the company. He is a classic model of the intense
      salesman—energized and inspired by the work that goes into selling
      a product. Amy Barrett reported in 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       that Weldon is known for saying, "It's no fun to be
      second." It's this philosophy that drives him to succeed and
      one that he expects from those who work with and for him.
    

      Weldon was born on November 26, 1948, in the borough of Brooklyn in New
      York City. His father was a union stagehand for Broadway performances
      while his mother worked as a seamstress for ballet and theater. In fact,
      she was responsible for the wardrobe of actress Marilyn Monroe during her
      performance for U.S. President John F. Kennedy's birthday
      celebration. When she finally retired in 2002, she was 80 years old.
      Obviously inspired by his parents' work ethic, Weldon told Barrett,
      "My parents were very hardworking, union people. It's a
      tough life."
    

      Weldon attended Ridgewood High School in New Jersey where he played on the
      basketball and football teams. A dedicated athlete throughout his life,
      especially in basketball, Weldon has had business offices designed to
      contain basketball courts. After graduating from high school, Weldon
      applied to Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut. To put himself
      through school he worked as a mover on weekends and holidays. While still
      in college he married his high school sweetheart, Barbara Dearborn.
    

      In 1971, he graduated from Quinnipiac with a bachelor's degree in
      biology. He interviewed for a job as a sales representative and got it
      based on an outstanding performance creating an impromptu sales pitch for
      a ballpoint pen. The company he was hired to work for was Johnson &
      Johnson, in their McNeil Pharmaceuticals division. In his more than
      30-year-long career with many different units of Johnson & Johnson,
      Weldon has effectively only had one interview.
    

      Throughout the 1980s, Weldon rose up through the ranks of the company.
      Most of his time during that decade he held manager and vice-presidential
      titles for some of the overseas divisions of Johnson & Johnson,
      like McNeil Limited in Korea and Ortho-Cilag Pharmaceutical in the United
      Kingdom. In 1995, he became president of Ethicon Endo-Surgery. The new
      unit was focused on endoscopic surgery and the tools associated with it.
      Weldon pursued sales in that area dogmatically and by 1996 Ethicon had
      surpassed the sales of the previous tool sales company.
    

      In 1998, he joined the executive committee and became worldwide chairman
      of pharmaceuticals. In this role, Weldon once again found himself striving
      to cover new territory. He stepped in and retooled how the decisions
      regarding what drugs to pursue were made. Instead of allowing the research
      scientists to decide on their own, he added research and development
      executives as well as managers from sales and marketing. In 2001, he was a
      key player in the acquisition of Alza Corporation, a company that had been
      competing with Johnson & Johnson in the area of drug delivery. For
      Johnson & Johnson, it was one of the company's largest
      acquisitions at the price of $13.2 billion.
    

      In 2002, Weldon succeeded former CEO Ralph Larsen, who had held the
      position since the late 1980s. In a company well-known for only hiring
      from within its ranks, it was an expected move. Also considered one of the
      best-run companies in the world, Weldon had huge expectations to meet. He
      would now be the head of a company with more than a century of history
      that was comprised of 204 businesses that covered the areas of drugs,
      medical devices, and consumer products. Weldon would be facing demands to
      keep the company growing at rates that had been stable for more than 20
      years.
    

      To Weldon's advantage is the existance of all those different
      businesses, which gives Johnson & Johnson a depth that few other
      companies can match. By combining strategies from the different units,
      Johnson & Johnson will be, as 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      's Barrett wrote, "perfectly positioned to profit from this
      shift toward combining drugs, devices, and diagnostics." Weldon
      explained to Barrett further, "There is a convergence that will
      allow us to do things we haven't done before." It does not
      hurt that the company has more than 9,000 scientists doing research in 40
      labs across the globe.
    

      Weldon also has the advantage of an excessively competitive spirit. He
      explained his goal-setting style in a speech given to the Stanford
      Graduate School of Business, "If you set a goal of 10 and reach 11,
      that's not really as good as setting a goal of 15 and reaching
      14." As another example of Weldon's hard-driving
      personality, Nick Valeriani, a colleague of Weldon's while he was
      head of Ethicon Endo-Surgery, reported to Barrett, "We'd
      have a great year and Bill would say, 'Nice job. Why
      couldn't it have been 25 percent higher?'"
    

      In 2005, Weldon was elected to head the board of directors for J. P.
      Morgan and Chase. His other memberships include the Sullivan Commission on
      Diversity in the Health Professions Workforce as well as being on the
      Board of Directors for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
      America and Vice Chairman for the Business Council. He also dedicates some
      time to the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Quinnipiac University.
    

      In 2006, Johnson & Johnson bought out the consumer division of drug
      manufacturer Pfizer. It was one of the biggest purchases for the company
      with Weldon at the helm. With Pfizer products under their name, Johnson
      & Johnson could add well-known brands such as Listerine, Nicorette,
      and Sudafed to their expansive and trusted list of products.
    

      In the past few years, Weldon has expanded his scope to spend time
      bringing up the new crop of businesspeople. Weldon has shown tenacity
      throughout his career as well as a genuine love for 
      getting into the game of selling and buying. When Jeff May of Newhouse
      News Service asked him how long he saw himself working at Johnson &
      Johnson, Weldon responded, "I love what I'm doing. I just
      don't think there could be a better organization. I don't
      see how I could ever want to do anything else. I have no plans, other than
      to keep doing what I'm doing."

Weldon, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, participates in the APEC CEO Summit in Honolulu, Hawaii November 12, 2011.Jason ReedNEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon will step down from his post in April after a series of recalls called into question the quality of the healthcare giant's products, from artificial hips to infant Tylenol. Weldon, 63, will remain chairman, the company said on Tuesday. He has held both roles for nearly 10 years, after three decades spent working his way through the company from his first job as a sales representative at J&J's McNeil consumer division. Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky, 51, will become CEO at the next board meeting on April 26, making him the ninth person to lead the company since J&J's founding in 1886. Under Weldon's tenure, J&J expanded a sprawling business comprising more than 250 companies, from prescription drugmakers to a medical devices division and units that make personal care products. J&J shares are up less than 2 percent since Weldon took over a decade ago, but have recovered about 14 percent since August 2010 when the company was mired in product recalls. In the past two years, the company that long prided itself on a credo of high quality has seen its reputation tarnished by massive recalls for products that were poorly manufactured or failed at a higher-than-expected rate. "Gorsky is inheriting a company with a better pharmaceutical pipeline than it had 5 or 6 years ago," Morgan, Keegan & Co analyst Jan Wald said. "He is inheriting a consumer division that's still embroiled in problems and he is getting a medical device business that he needs to refresh and restructure and get it to grow again." "He's got a lot of work to do and it is going to be very hard to affect anything in the short-term," Wald said. Related CoverageTimeline: Johnson & Johnson's product recallsThe quality control problems at J&J's McNeil consumer healthcare unit -- which makes over-the-counter medicines like painkillers Tylenol and Motrin -- were deemed so pervasive that U.S. health regulators took over supervision of three manufacturing plants in March. Under a consent decree that the McNeil unit was forced to enter into, the U.S. government will oversee those errant plants for at least five years, an independent expert was retained to inspect manufacturing facilities and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can levy fines up to $10 million annually if it feels the agreement has been violated. The consumer products recalls cost the company nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales. Last month, the company said it would take a $3 billion charge, mostly to cover costs for its recall of metal artificial hips by its DePuy Orthopedics unit. The company also had to recall contact lenses, heart devices, such as stents, and insulin pump cartridges. The latest trouble came just last Friday, when J&J recalled the entire U.S. supply -- 574,000 bottles -- of its infant Tylenol soon after the product had returned to pharmacy shelves. Weldon was called before Congress in late 2010 to address the recalls, including an incident in which J&J hired contractors to pose as customers and buy defective bottles of Motrin at drugstores rather than alert the general public. "This was not one of our finer moments," Weldon said at the time. Two-Way Race Gorsky is the latest in a long line of CEOs to come from within the company, although he left in 2004 for a four-year stint as Novartis' head of pharmaceuticals in North America before returning to J&J. "Any time you change the hand at the tiller, it's liable to liven things up a bit," said Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic. Miksic said he does not expect to see great rapid changes, but added, "resolution of the succession question and an energized new CEO rising to the challenge is a good thing for the company." Gorsky began his J&J career in 1988 as a sales representative with the Janssen Pharmaceutica unit. In 2001, he was appointed president of Janssen, and in 2003, Gorsky became group chairman of Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceuticals business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. After returning to the J&J fold he became global chairman of the Surgical Care Group. Investors had expected Weldon would be succeeded by Gorsky or co-Vice Chairman Sheri McCoy, who were promoted to the shared post in December 2010. McCoy will report to Gorsky and continue to lead the company's pharmaceuticals and consumer groups. J&J's planned $21 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes, its largest ever, may have helped tip the decision in Gorsky's favor, some said. "Medical devices has now become their biggest division by sales and earnings and is going to be even bigger when the Synthes deal closes, and that's obviously Alex Gorsky's background," said Jeff Jonas, co-portfolio manager for the Gabelli Healthcare and Wellness Trust, which holds J&J stock. Jonas said he'd like to see J&J buy back more of its stock going forward, a move not likely before the company closes on the Synthes deal. J&J shares were nearly unchanged after the announcement. He noted that J&J has new promise with a pipeline of medicines including blood clot preventer Xarelto, developed with Bayer AG, and prostate cancer drug Zytiga. "He's done a good job for most of the business but obviously the consumer business is sort of a big black eye," Jonas said of Weldon. "He chose good managers."

William C. Weldon


Making the World 
			    a Better and Healthier Place


An Interview with William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson


Editors’ Note
William Weldon was elected to the Board of Directors and named Vice Chairman of the Board in 2001, and assumed his current responsibilities as Chairman and CEO in 2002. In 1971, he joined the company and served in several sales, marketing, and international management positions before becoming President of Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Endo-Surgery company in 1992 and its Company Group Chairman in 1995. He was appointed to the Executive Committee and named Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals Group in 1998. Weldon also served as Chairman of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer. Other public company board service includes JPMorgan Chase & Co. from 2005 to present.
Company Brief
Johnson & Johnson (www.jnj.com; J&J) embraces research and science, bringing innovative ideas, products, and services to advance the health and well-being of people. Their approximately 118,000 employees at more than 250 Johnson & Johnson companies work with partners in health care to touch the lives of over a billion people every day throughout the world. Johnson & Johnson was named number 12 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for 2012.
How do the company’s values impact the work you do and how critical are those values to the culture of Johnson & Johnson?
The values expressed in our credo are the heart of our culture. We are responsible first to patients, customers, and consumers, then to our employees, then to the community, and finally, to our shareholders. These values have guided us since our founding and continue to inspire our employees around the world to develop innovative health care products, volunteer in the community, and care for generations of people throughout every stage of their lives.
Our values are also reflected in our partnerships with many organizations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations and many of its agencies, and various other community and government organizations. For instance, we work with global partners to treat up to 25 million children a year for intestinal worms with our drug mebendazole; we have global access programs for underserved patients who rely on our HIV-AIDS medications; and we partner with UCLA and other organizations to build health care capacity around the world through programs like the Management Development Institute, a one-week intensive training program for health care professionals in sub-Saharan Africa.
What has allowed J&J to remain an industry leader known for its strong financial results and for having the highest levels of quality and integrity?
We’re proud of our long track record of strong financial results and our legacy of great products that goes back to our first sterile surgical products in 1886. We’ve been part of people’s lives for 126 years and part of their investments for more than 65 years. Our business does not come without challenges. But we have turned the corner on a difficult period for our company and are excited to be developing state-of-the-art quality management systems and great products that deliver value and address significant unmet health care needs. What makes all of that possible – and what makes Johnson & Johnson so special – is our people, who come to work each day with a passion to make the world better for patients, families, and communities across the globe.
Would you highlight the importance of corporate citizenship and community engagement to the culture of J&J?
At Johnson & Johnson, we consider ourselves a part of the communities in which we operate across the world so we have a responsibility to help improve the lives of the men, women, and children in those communities. And citizenship is broader than our philanthropic programs; it is core to everything we do and every way we touch our stakeholders around the world. So that includes our environmental sustainability, corporate governance, social commitments, commitment to global diversity and inclusion, adherence to laws and standards, and more. Since our founding, we have been engaged in partnerships with the medical profession, governments, retail customers, patients, and consumers to help meet the needs of people worldwide.
One area of focus for over a century is improving maternal and child health. More than 100 years ago, we worked with the medical profession in the U.S. to make childbirth safer and provide health information for women; today, we work to treat and prevent obstetric fistula, prevent the transmission of HIV to babies, and ensure safe births in the developing world. We’re a founding partner of Text4Baby in the U.S. and Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action globally, which provide free mobile information to improve maternal and infant health.
How do you focus your corporate citizenship and philanthropic efforts and is it important that these efforts align with J&J’s business strategy?
We see our citizenship and our business as driving toward the same goal: to make the world a better and healthier place. We do this through the products we discover and develop, our positions on public policy issues, the way we run our businesses every day, and the programs and alliances that we form and participate in.
Our broad base in health care allows us to leverage resources and knowledge from across our organization. We are collaborating across our enterprise to support the United Nation’s global strategy to reduce mortality in women and children by 2015. Our commitment includes a program to deliver pre- and post-natal health information to mothers in the developing world via mobile phones; training and support for front-line health workers; a program to help eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV; and using R&D to develop new treatments for HIV and TB, and enhancing access to those treatments for patients around the world.
As you transition exclusively to the Chairman role at J&J, what are you most proud of during your time as CEO and what will you miss the most about the role?
I am proudest of seeing how Johnson & Johnson has stepped up its role in global health care. We’re working with more governments to address issues like expanding access to medicines and health care services, containing costs, and maintaining high quality care. We’re partnering with global NGOs and community based organizations to address global health problems. I’m also proud of all of the strides we’ve made in global diversity and inclusion, so that our worldwide organization today more closely reflects the patients, families, and communities we serve. We’ve worked to address other needs –such as critical nursing shortages – in more countries through efforts such as the Johnson & Johnson Campaign for Nursing’s Future in the U.S. and programs in countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana. As I make the transition, what I’ll miss most is the opportunities I’ve had to work with so many exceptional men and women of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies.•

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
