 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years.

EXPLANATORY
NOTE REGARDING THIS FORM 10-Q/A

 

Aspect
FuturesAccess LLC (the “Registrant”) is filing this
Amendment No. 1 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016, originally filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2016
(the “Original Form 10-Q”).  This Amendment
pertains to correcting certain net asset value calculations at
specified dates during the second quarter of 2016, which are set
forth in Part I, Item 2 (Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and
Part II, Item 2 (Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds).

 

Except as
described above, this Amendment No. 1 does not amend any other
information set forth in the Original Form 10-Q and the
Registrant has not updated disclosures included therein to reflect
any events that occurred subsequent to June 30,
2016.

PART I
— FINANCIAL INFORMATION

 


Item
2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

 

PERIOD-END
NET ASSET VALUE PER UNIT

 

The Fund
calculates the Net Asset Value per Unit of each Class of Units
as of the last calendar day of each month, the fifteenth calendar
day of each month and as of any other dates MLAI may determine in
its discretion (each, a “Calculation Date”). The
Fund’s Net Asset Value as of any Calculation Date generally
equals the value of the Fund’s account under the management
of the Trading Advisor as of that date, plus any other assets held
by the Fund, minus accrued sponsor, management and performance
fees, trading liabilities, including brokerage commissions, any
offering or operating costs, and all other liabilities of the
Fund.  MLAI or its delegates are authorized to make all Net
Asset Value determinations.

 

MLAI
believes that the Net Asset Value used to calculate subscription
and redemption value and to report performance to investors is a
useful performance measure for the investors of the Fund. 
Therefore, the charts below are referencing Net Asset Value at each
Calculation Date.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

The Fund
borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term
basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated
trading positions pending the conversion of the Fund’s
U.S. dollar deposits.  These borrowings are at a
prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency.

 

Substantially
all of the Fund’s assets are held in cash with the brokers.
Changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down
price trends, during which the Fund’s profit or loss
potential might increase. Inflation in commodity prices could also
generate price movements, which the strategies might successfully
follow. The Fund should be able to close out its open trading
positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at
market prices, except in unusual circumstances.  This
typically permits the Fund to limit losses as well as reduce market
exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing
so.

 

As a
commodity pool, the Fund maintains an extremely large percentage of
its assets in cash, which it must have available to post initial
and variation margin on futures contracts.  This cash is also
used to fund redemptions.  While the Fund has the ability to
fund redemption proceeds from liquidating positions, as a practical
matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions.  In
the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions, MLAI,
as the Manager of the Fund, has the ability to override decisions
of the Trading Advisor to fund redemptions if necessary, but in
practice the Trading Advisor would determine in its discretion
which investments should be liquidated.

 

For the
six month period ended June 30, 2016 Fund capital decreased
1.22% from $124,871,836 to $123,346,573. This decrease was
attributable to the net loss from operations of $2,495,016 coupled
with the redemption of 4,098,065 redeemable Units resulting in an
outflow of $6,627,912.  The cash outflow was offset with cash
inflow of $7,597,665 due to subscriptions of 4,830,031 Units.
Future redemptions could impact the amount of funds available for
investment in commodity contract positions in subsequent
months.

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

Statement
of Cash Flows

 

The Fund
is not required to provide a Statement of Cash Flows.

 

Investments

 

All
investments (including derivatives) are held for trading
purposes.  Investments are recorded on trade date and open
contracts are recorded at fair value (as described below) at the
measurement date.  Investments denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates
prevailing at the measurement date.  Profits or losses are
realized when contracts are liquidated.  Unrealized profits or
losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in
commodity trading accounts on the Statements of Financial
Condition.  Realized profits or losses and any change in net
unrealized profits or losses from the preceding period are reported
in the Statements of Operations.

 

4


  

 

 

Fair Value
Measurements

 

Fair value
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.  For more
information on the Fund’s treatment of fair value, see
Financial Statements Note 3, Fair Value of Investments.

 

Futures
Contracts

 

The Fund
trades exchange listed futures contracts.  A listed futures
contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a standardized
quantity of an underlying asset over a specified duration. 
The Fund buys and sells contracts based on indices of financial
assets such as stocks, domestic and global stock indices, as well
as contracts on various physical commodities. Prices paid or
received on these contracts are determined by the ask or bid
provided by the exchanges on which they are traded.  
Contracts may be settled in physical form or cash settled depending
upon the contract.  Upon the execution of a trade, margin
requirements determine the amount of cash that must be on deposit
to secure the transaction.  These amounts are considered
restricted cash on the Fund’s Statements of Financial
Condition.  Contracts are priced daily by the Fund and the
profit or loss is based on the daily mark to market and is recorded
as unrealized profit (loss).  When the contract is closed, the
Fund records a realized profit or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the
value at the time it was closed.  Because transactions in
futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin
deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits,
through the futures broker or directly with the exchange on which
the contracts are traded, credit exposure is limited. 
Realized profit (loss), net and change in unrealized profit (loss),
net on futures contracts are recognized in the period in which the
contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively and are
included in the Statements of Operations.  The Fund also
trades futures contracts on the London Metals Exchange (LME). The
valuation pricing for LME contracts is based on action of a
committee that incorporates prices from the most liquid trading
sessions of the day and can also rely on other inputs such as
supply and demand factors and bids and asks from open outcry
sessions.

 

Forward
Foreign Currency Contracts

 

Foreign
currency contracts are those contracts where the Fund agrees to
receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an
agreed-upon price on an agreed future date.  Foreign currency
contracts are valued daily, and the Fund’s net equity
therein, representing unrealized profit or loss on the contracts as
measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange
rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward
rates at the reporting date, is included in the Statements of
Financial Condition.  Realized profit (loss), net and change
in unrealized profit (loss), net on foreign currency contracts are
recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the
changes occur, respectively and are included in the Statements of
Operations.

 

Interest
Rates and Income

 

BofA
Corp.’s “Interest Earning Program”, which offers
interest on cash balances subject to a negotiated schedule, will
generally apply to Fund cash assets during any time they are
maintained by the Sponsor with its affiliates.  The present
interest rate under the Interest Earning Program on U.S. dollar
cash balances is the daily effective federal funds rate less 20
basis points, recalculated and accrued daily, and subject to a
floor of 0%, except for currencies designated by MLPF&S as
“negative interest rate currencies”.  MLPF&S
deposits certain of the Fund’s assets as margin or collateral
with clearinghouses and/or depositories. As a result of the present
low interest rate environment, clearinghouses and depositories
charge MLPF&S fees to account for the negative interest rates
on cash balances for certain

 

5


  

 

 

currencies,
which may change from time to time.  Accordingly, MLPF&S
will charge the Fund a “negative interest rate fee” for
any currencies designated by MLPF&S as a “negative
interest rate currency”.

 

Income
Taxes

 

Each
investor is individually responsible for reporting income or loss
based on such investor’s share of the Fund’s income and
expenses as reported for income tax purposes.

 

The Fund
follows the ASC guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions.
This guidance provides how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
statements.  This guidance also requires the evaluation of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing
the Fund’s financial statements to determine whether the tax
positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by
the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions with respect to
tax at the Fund level not deemed to meet the
“more-likely-than-not” threshold would be recorded as a
tax benefit or expense in the current year. A prospective investor
should be aware that, among other things, income taxes could have a
material adverse effect on the periodic calculations of the Net
Asset Value of the Fund, including reducing the Net Asset Value of
the Fund to reflect reserves for income taxes, such as foreign
withholding taxes, that may be payable by the Fund. This could
cause benefits or detriments to certain investors, depending upon
the timing of their entry and exit from the Fund. MLAI has analyzed
the Fund’s tax positions and has concluded that a provision
for income tax of $517,000, generated by trading in Spain, is
required in the Fund’s financial statements.  Such
amount, which is included in Other Liabilities on the Statement of
Financial Condition as of June 30, 2016, is net of a $647,420
reversal of tax exposure which is reflected within other income on
the 2016 Statements of Operations.   The following is the
major tax jurisdiction for the Fund and the earliest tax year
subject to examination: United States — 2012.

 

Reform
Act

 

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended
the definition of “eligible contract participant” and
the Fund expects to meet the amended definition as it applies to
trading in “retail forex” transactions so long as its
total assets exceed $10 million.  If the Fund does not meet
the definition of “eligible contract participant” for
purposes of trading in “retail forex” transactions, it
could lead to the Fund being unable to trade such transactions in
the interbank market and bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market
margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition
of new or increased fees.  “Retail forex” markets
available to parties that do not meet the definition of
“eligible contract participant” could also be
significantly less liquid than the interbank market. 
Moreover, the creditworthiness of the counterparties with whom the
Fund may be required to trade in such circumstances could be
significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of MLI and the
currency forward counterparties with which the Fund would otherwise
engage for its currency forward transactions.

Results of
Operations

 

January 1,
2016 to June 30, 2016

 

January 1,
2016 to March 31, 2016

 

The Fund
experienced a net trading profit of $2,551,977 before brokerage
commissions and related fees in the first quarter of 2016. The
Fund’s profits were primarily attributable to the interest
rates and energy sectors. The stock indices, agriculture, metals
and currency sectors posted losses.

 

The
interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were
posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Poor
economic data from the U.S. and China raised concerns about the
global economy and caused bond markets to rally on safe haven
appeal. This led to profits from the Trading Program’s long
bond positions. Later in January, speculation that the European
Central Bank would introduce additional stimulus measures and the
Bank of Japan’s decision to reduce interest rates drove
further profits. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of
the quarter. Against a background of heightened volatility in
equity markets, safe haven assets were favored by investors. This,
combined with the threat of deflation in Europe and Japan, saw
investors favoring longer maturity fixed income markets which
resulted in profits posted to the Fund from the Trading
Program’s long fixed income positions. Losses were posted to
the Fund at the end of the quarter as the Trading Program’s
long fixed income exposures were affected as a resurgence of global
risk appetite led to bonds generally trading lower.

 

The energy
sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund
at the beginning of the first quarter. The Trading Program’s
short positions in oils made gains as prices fell below $30 per
barrel, driven by a rise in U.S. inventory levels and the
expectation of additional production from Iran. Profits were posted
to the Fund in the middle of the quarter as the Trading Program
profited from continuing bearish trends in natural gas as an
inventory glut pushed prices lower. Losses were posted to the Fund
at the end of the quarter due to the Trading Program’s short
positions in energies as natural gas rallied during the month of
March.

 

The stock
indices sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the
Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The large sell-offs in
stock markets led to losses from the stock indices sector at the
beginning of January. However, the Trading Program responded and
switched its small net long positions to net short positions.
During January, most stock indices recorded losses, but there were
profits from short positions in emerging market stock indices.
Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter.
Against a background of heightened volatility in equity markets,
safe haven assets were favored by investors in February. The
Trading Program’s small short exposures to emerging markets,
such as the Indian Nifty and the Chinese H-Shares indices also
posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the
end of the quarter. Mixed directional positioning among stock
indices led to small gains overall in March. In particular, gains
were made from the long position in Korea but remaining shorts
positions in China and other emerging markets detracted from
gains.

 

The
agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to
the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter, however this
reversed in the middle of the quarter as the Trading Program
profited from continuing bearish trends in wheat contracts as an
inventory glut pushed prices lower. Losses were posted to the Fund
at the end of the quarter due to the Trading Program’s short
positions in grains.

 

The metals
sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund
at the beginning of the first quarter, however this reversed in the
middle of the quarter. A tighter global supply of zinc as a result
of production cuts led to a price rally which negatively affected
the Trading Program’s short positions. Gold and silver
appreciated during February as investors sought refuge from
the equity sell-off. The Trading Program’s positions switched
to long positions but were unable to turn a profit in February.
Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter due to the
Trading Program’s short positions in metal which rallied
during March.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
