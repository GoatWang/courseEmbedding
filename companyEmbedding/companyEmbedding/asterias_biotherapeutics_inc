About Asterias Biotherapeutics



Asterias Biotherapeutics is a biotechnology company pioneering the field of regenerative medicine.  We even draw our name from the common starfish, Asterias rubens, which has the ability to regenerate lost limbs even in adulthood.  We are focused on employing our pluripotent stem cell and cancer immunotherapy platforms to develop therapeutics addressing significant unmet medical needs in neurology and oncology. These clinical-stage programs are supported by robust proof-of-concept pre-clinical and clinical data. Our three clinical-stage programs include:







AST-OPC1


AST-VAC1



AST-VAC2





AST-OPC1 is a product in development for spinal cord injuries utilizing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which we manufacture from our pluripotent stem cell platform. With significant financial support from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in subacute, cervical (neck) spinal cord injury.  AST-OPC1 cells are inserted directly into the damaged section of the spinal cord through a surgical procedure.  The hope is that addition of these cells, which support the healthy functioning of nerve cells, can improve the transmission of signals from the brain through the spinal cord and out to the upper extremities, so that patients can better regain use of their arms, hands and fingers.  Regaining use of the upper extremities can dramatically reduce health care costs and have a direct impact on a patient's ability to live independently.  Approximately 17,000 people each year in the US suffer spinal cord injuries, and there are currently no therapies available to address these devastating injuries. 


AST-VAC1 is an autologous (patient-specific) immunotherapy treatment for maintaining remission in individuals suffering from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). AST-VAC1 has the potential to supplement current chemotherapy regimens in order to improve long-term remission for these patients, as demonstrated in a phase 2 trial.  Asterias is presently developing a manufacturing process in order to be able to produce clinical trial material in support of a phase 2b study expected to commence in 2018. 


AST-VAC2 is an allogeneic (non-patient specific) immunotherapy manufactured using cells from our pluripotent stem cell line. We have partnered with Cancer Research-UK (CRUK) to investigate AST-VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer, and CRUK is fully funding the first phase 1/2a clinical study.  The first patient is expected to be enrolled in the second quarter of 2017. Additionally, AST-VAC2 has potential application in a wide range other cancers, and is likely synergistic with other immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. 




Our team has a long history of advancing therapies in regenerative medicine. Many of our senior leaders have extensive experience developing our technology assets prior to the inception of Asterias in 2012. The Asterias technology platforms are based upon a strong foundation of hundreds of pieces of intellectual property, proprietary cell banks, and scientific data which we acquired at our founding in 2013. While our near term focus is to build out the three pipeline programs discussed above, our flexible technology platforms could unlock further therapeutic opportunities in the future.

The Asterias technology platforms are based upon a strong foundation of hundreds of pieces of intellectual property, proprietary cell banks, and scientific data which we acquired at our founding in 2013. While our near term focus is to build out the three pipeline programs discussed above, our flexible technology platforms could unlock further therapeutic opportunities in the future.

Asterias Biotherapeutics Completes Enrollment and Dosing of SCiStar Study's AIS-A 20 Million Cell Cohort
Jul 17 17
Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. announced completion of enrollment and dosing of the AIS-A 20 million cell cohort in the company's ongoing SCiStar Phase 1/2a clinical study of AST-OPC1 in complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). In this cohort, five patients with AIS-A grade SCIs were administered 20 million AST-OPC1 cells. The 20 million AST-OPC1 cell dose is to be investigated in the SCiStar Phase 1/2a clinical trial. The company expects to report top-line six-month results from this cohort in January 2018. Enrolling and dosing the fifth patient in this cohort triggers the final $1.5 million grant payment from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) under the existing $14.3 million Strategic Partnerships Award grant awarded to Asterias. Asterias expects to receive this grant payment in the third quarter of 2017. Asterias has now completed enrollment and dosing in four of the five planned SCiStar study cohorts and enrolled twenty patients in the SCiStar study. Twenty-five patients have been administered AST-OPC1 after including patients from a previous Phase 1 safety trial and results-to-date continue to support the safety of AST-OPC1, with no serious adverse events related to AST-OPC1 or its administration. In June 2017, Asterias reported 9 month data from the AIS-A 10 million cell cohort that showed improvements in arm, hand and finger function observed at 3-months and 6-months following administration of AST-OPC1 were confirmed and in some patients further increased at 9-months. The company intends to complete enrollment of the entire SCiStar study later this year, with multiple safety and efficacy readouts anticipated during the remainder of 2017 and 2018.


Asterias Announces Update on Phase I/IIa Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Study
Jul 10 17
Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. has announced that the FDA has accepted its amendment to the clinical research protocol for its ongoing AST-OPC1 SCiStar Phase I/IIa clinical trial in motor complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The amendment expands the eligibility criteria to include patients with a C-4 spinal cord injury and extends the dosing window from 14 to 30 days to 21 to 42 days post-injury. The FDA's decision to allow Asterias to enroll qualified patients with C-4 level injuries is the result of the data supporting the safety of both AST-OPC1 and the procedure to inject the cells, and means that the second most common cervical spinal cord injury population can now be eligible to receive AST-OPC1. The overall changes to the study protocol will enhance the ability to enroll qualified patient candidates for current SCiStar study and also expect the changes to help enrollment rates in a future, larger clinical study. The protocol amendment will expand patient eligibility and enable study investigators to administer AST-OPC1 to patients with injuries at one vertebral level higher than the trial's previous C-5 limitation, to the fourth cervical vertebra down, known as C-4, near the middle of the neck. A C-4 cervical level injury, the second most common level of SCI in the SCiStar study's targeted patient population, generally means that the injured person is paralyzed from the neck down and requires round-the-clock care. The lifetime direct costs of care for a patient suffering a high cervical spinal cord injury, such as a C-4 spinal cord injury, can approach $5 million.


Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. Appoints Michael Mulroy to Serve on the Board, Effective from June 26, 2017
Jun 16 17
At a meeting of the Board of Directors of Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. on June 14, 2017, the Board increased the number of members on the Board from nine to ten and elected Michael Mulroy, the company's incoming President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve on the Board, effective June 26, 2017 and upon commencement of his employment with the company.

			Asterias Biotherapeutics Receives $11.7 Million in Proceeds from Exercise of Warrants			



MENLO PARK, Calif., May 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: AST), a biotechnology company focused on the emerging field of regenerative medicine, today announced that all outstanding common share purchase warrants originally issued inJune 2014 were exercised prior to their expiry on June 15, 2015, resulting in total proceeds to the Company of $11.7 million.
“We thank our shareholders for their continued support,” said Pedro Lichtinger, President and CEO of Asterias. “This exercise of warrants represents a strong vote of confidence from our long-term shareholders in Asterias, the prospects for our clinical programs, and our potential to create value. The $11.7 million in proceeds strengthens our balance sheet and will be used to further advance our development programs focused on major unmet medical needs without adequate available therapies, including AST-OPC1 for spinal cord injuries and AST-VAC2 for lung cancer.”
“Asterias has made significant progress since these warrants were issued nearly 12 months ago,” continued Mr. Lichtinger.  “Among other accomplishments, we obtained commitments for non-dilutive financing from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Research U.K., we received FDA clearance and initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for AST-OPC1 for complete cervical spinal cord injury (“SCI”), and the abstract from the Phase 2 clinical trial of our autologous telomerase-based dendritic cell cancer vaccine, AST-VAC1, was selected for an oral presentation on May 30, 2015 at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.”

					Full Description



Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc., incorporated on October 24, 2012, is a biotechnology company. The Company is engaged in developing and commercializing therapies in the fields of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The Company has over two technology platforms. The first is an immunotherapy platform to teach cancer patients' immune systems to attack their tumors. The second is pluripotent stem cell platform. Pluripotent cells are a type of stem cell capable of becoming all of the cell types in the human body. The Company is focused on developing therapies to treat conditions with medical needs and inadequate available therapies, with an initial focus on the therapeutic areas of oncology and neurology. From its immunotherapy platform, the Company is developing over two programs. AST-VAC1 (telomerase loaded, autologous dendritic cells), which allows patient's own cells to recognize and fight cancer cells in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Together with its collaboration partner, Cancer Research United Kingdom (CRUK), it is developing AST-VAC2 (telomerase loaded, -allogeneic dendritic cells), -derived from pluripotent stem cells which could provide off the shelf cells that teaches a patient's immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells, in non-small cell lung cancer. From its pluripotent stem cell platform, it is developing AST-OPC1, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, in an initial clinical indication of spinal cord injury, with potential for later expansion into other neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke and multiple sclerosis.AST-VAC1: Autologous Telomerase-loaded, Dendritic CellsAST-VAC1 is an autologous product candidate, or a product that is derived from cells that come from the treated patient. AST-VAC1 consists of mature antigen-presenting dendritic cells pulsed with Ribonucleic acid (RNA) for the protein component of human telomerase (hTERT) and a portion of a lysosomal targeting signal (LAMP). LAMP directs the telomerase RNA to the lysosome, the subcellular organelle that directs the RNA to a particular part of the cell membrane. AST-VAC1 is injected into the patient's skin, with the objective of the dendritic cells to travel to the lymph nodes and instruct cytotoxic T-cells to kill tumor cells that express telomerase on their surface. The Company has completed Phase II clinical trial of AST-VAC1.AST-VAC2: hES Cell-Derived Allogeneic Dendritic CellsAST-VAC2 is an allogeneic or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and can be modified with any antigen. The use of hES, as opposed to collecting and using the patient's own blood, as the starting material for AST-VAC2 provides a scalable system for the production of various vaccine doses in a single lot. AST-VAC2 may be synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors in development for many cancer indications. AST-VAC2 program are progressed towards a Phase I/IIa clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer in collaboration with Cancer Research UK (CRUK).AST-OPC1 Glial Progenitor CellsThe Company's AST-OPC1 product candidate consists of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection, derived from a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) master cell bank of undifferentiated hES cells that has been fully qualified for human use. The cells, which are stored frozen until ready for use, are produced under cGMP conditions and screened for adventitious agents. AST-OPC1 cells reproduce the natural functions of oligodendrocytes in animal models, including producing myelin that wraps around nerve fibers; producing neurotrophic factors, which offer neuro-regeneration and sprouting of new nerve endings, and inducing new blood vessels, which provide nutrients and remove waste matter from neural tissue as it functions in the body. The Company has completed Phase I trial of AST-OPC1 in thoracic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI).

MENLO PARK, Calif. & ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. and BioTime, Inc. (NYSE MKT: BTX) jointly 
      announced today the closing of the transactions under the Asset 
      Contribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Geron Corporation, 
      previously announced on January 7, 2013, pursuant to which Asterias 
      Biotherapeutics acquired Geron’s human embryonic stem (hES) cell assets, 
      as well as rights to use certain human embryonic stem cell lines, 
      minority stakes in two of BioTime's subsidiaries and stock from BioTime.
    

Assets Contributed to Asterias by Geron


      Under the terms of the Agreement, Geron has contributed to Asterias its 
      stem cell intellectual property, multiple lots of OPC1 drug product (hES 
      cell-derived oligodendrocytes) used in the world’s first human clinical 
      trial of hES-derived cells in subacute spinal cord injury, multiple lots 
      of hESC manufacturing cell banks - the starting material to manufacture 
      additional lots of OPC1 drug product and to produce dendritric cells for 
      cancer immunotherapy, chondrocytes for cartilage and disc repair, and 
      cardiomyocytes for heart disease. Geron has also contributed all of the 
      clinical and regulatory documents pertaining to the OPC1 and VAC1 
      (autologous dendritic cells) clinical trials, as well as a series of 
      stem-cell-related out-licenses. Asterias has entered into an exclusive 
      sublicense with Geron for using telomerase as an antigen for the VAC1 
      and VAC2 (hES-derived dendritic cells) product candidates.
    

Assets Contributed to Asterias by BioTime


      BioTime has previously loaned Asterias $5 million in cash, which 
      indebtedness was cancelled as part of the closing of the transaction. 
      Under the terms of the Agreement, BioTime contributed to Asterias 
      8,902,077 BioTime common shares, rights to use certain clinical grade 
      hES cell lines, a sublicense to use certain patents for stem cell 
      differentiation and minority stakes in two of BioTime’s subsidiaries, 
      Orthocyte Corporation and Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. In addition, 
      BioTime has contributed to Asterias 5-year warrants to purchase 
      5,000,000 common shares of BioTime at an exercise price of $5.00 per 
      share (“BioTime Warrants”) which will be distributed by Asterias on a pro 
      rata basis to holders of its Series A common stock, as further 
      described below.
    

      The assets contributed under the Agreement provide Asterias with four 
      cell lines, each with animal proof of concept, from which multiple 
      therapeutic product candidates may be selected for development 
      indications as summarized below.
    


Neurology – An initial Phase 1 safety 
        study in spinal cord injury has been completed with follow-on 
        opportunities in larger indications in Multiple Sclerosis and stroke.
      

Oncology – A Phase 2/3 ready cancer 
        vaccine (VAC1) with an opportunity to continue the development of a 
        second approach using dendritic cells derived from hESCs (VAC2).
      

Orthopedics – Opportunity to continue the 
        development of hESC derived chondrocytes to regenerate articular 
        cartilage to address osteoarthritis.
      

Cardiovascular – Opportunity to continue 
        the development of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes for heart failure and 
        myocardial infarction.
      


Consideration to Geron and BioTime from Asterias; 
      Distributions by Geron and Asterias


      Under the terms of the Agreement, Geron has received from Asterias 
      6,537,779 shares of Asterias Series A common stock. Subject to 
      applicable law, Geron will distribute these shares on a pro rata 
      basis to Geron stockholders as promptly as practicable, other than with 
      respect to fractional shares and with respect to stockholders residing 
      in certain to-be-determined excluded jurisdictions, who will instead 
      receive cash on a pro rata basis. As promptly as practicable 
      following the distribution of the Asterias Series A common stock by 
      Geron to its stockholders, Asterias will distribute the BioTime Warrants 
      on a pro rata basis to the holders of Asterias Series A common 
      stock.
    

      Asterias will also pay to Geron royalties on the sale of products that 
      are commercialized, if any, in reliance on Geron patents contributed or 
      licensed to Asterias.
    

      Asterias has issued to BioTime 21,773,340 shares of Asterias Series B 
      common stock and 3-year warrants to purchase 3,150,000 additional shares 
      of Asterias Series B common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per 
      share.
    

The Romulus Films, Ltd. Investment


      In a related transaction, Asterias has obtained $5 million in equity 
      financing pursuant to a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with 
      Romulus Films, Ltd., in exchange for 2,136,000 shares of Asterias Series 
      B common stock, plus warrants to purchase approximately 350,000 
      additional shares of Asterias Series B common shares at an exercise 
      price of $5.00 per share, with a three year term. Earlier this year, 
      Romulus invested $5 million in BioTime, which BioTime used to fund the 
      loan to Asterias for its operations.
    

Ownership of Asterias Terms of Asterias Series A 
      and Series B Common Stock; Trading Markets


      Upon the distributions of the Series A common stock to Geron’s 
      stockholders described above, BioTime will own approximately 71.6%, 
      Geron stockholders will own approximately 21.4%, and Romulus will own 
      approximately 7% of the outstanding Asterias common stock. BioTime and 
      Romulus could increase their collective ownership in Asterias by 
      approximately 2.2% if they choose to exercise all of their warrants, 
      which would reduce the Geron stockholders’ ownership in Asterias to 
      approximately 19.2%.
    

      The terms of the Asterias Series A and Series B common stock are 
      identical, except that Asterias is entitled to make certain 
      distributions or pay dividends on its Series A common stock without 
      making a distribution or paying a dividend on its Series B common stock. 
      The Series B common stock will be convertible into Series A common stock 
      following the distribution of the BioTime Warrants described above.
    

      Asterias expects that prices for the Asterias Series A common stock will 
      be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board following the distribution of the 
      Asterias Series A common stock to Geron’s stockholders. BioTime has 
      applied to list the BioTime Warrants for trading on the NYSE MKT, where 
      BioTime common shares are traded.
    

      Kaye Scholer LLP and Thompson, Welch, Soroko & Gilbert LLP acted as 
      legal counsel to Asterias and BioTime in connection with the transaction.
    

      A registration statement on Form S-1 relating to the distribution of 
      Asterias Series A common stock by Geron to its stockholders was 
      previously filed by Asterias with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (“SEC”) and is effective. The registration statement is available at the 
      SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov,.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
