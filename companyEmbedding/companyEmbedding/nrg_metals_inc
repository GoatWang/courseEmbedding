About UsNRG Metals Inc.The strategic contribution of ArgentinaNRG Metals Inc. is a Junior Canadian Exploration company in search of brine based lithium targets in Argentina, Chile and Boliva. Over half of the earth's identified resources of the mineral are found in this South American  &quotlithium  triangle.&quot For 10 or 12 years, Argentina was a do-not-invest zone. The tone of doing business has just swung 180 degrees with the new Mauricio Macri government that took over in December 2015.The two main sectors
driving the price and sale of energy metals are BATTERIES for cars and STORAGE for clean energy

Lithium. Powering our Future.
THE SHIFT TO CLEAN ENERGY IS CREATING A BOOM MARKET FOR ENERGY METALS


The age of electrification across the transportation sector, the solar panel revolution, and Tesla’s battery gigafactory are igniting a battle for the cheapest battery. That will transform lithium into a boom-time mineral and the hottest commodity on the energy investor’s radar. It has been easy to take lithium for granted. This wonder mineral is the backbone of our everyday lives, popping up in everything from the glass in our windows to our mountains of electronics.



And while investors have long appreciated the steady rise in demand for this preferred mineral, the number of new applications continues to multiply. Smart phones, tablets, laptops, and other consumer electronics demand more lithium. But the largest driver for future lithium use will be in electric vehicles and home batteries for solar panels. That has lithium on the verge a boom for which supply can no longer be taken for granted.
