Lisa  Polezoes's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Tiger Paws
Job Details
               Tiger PAWS (Parents Association Working for Students) is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization committed to assuring Wheaton Warrenville South students have a well-rounded high school experience. Through fundraising and volunteerism, we provide support for academic achievement and school-sponsored teams, clubs and extra curricular activities at Wheaton Warrenville South High School. We are similar to a booster club; at Friday night football games you will see Tiger PAWS volunteers throughout Red Grange Stadium. However, unlike a booster club, we also strive to enrich the academic experience at South. In fact, the majority of the money raised by PAWS is allocated to the math, science and languages departments. We are proud of the fact that we support each and every student at South. Your membership fees and donations and/or your involvement with our fundraisers and events make this possible.
