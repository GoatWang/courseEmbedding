The Case for Diversification across the Dividend Yield Spectrum
Focusing on the highest dividend yielders may not always result in the highest return.








Data source: FactSet Alpha Testing, 1/1/07-3/31/17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not protect against loss. Non-dividend payers are  those companies in the S&P 500 Index that have a yield of 0.0%.
This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor's objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.  This material is for informational and educational purposes only and is not intended to predict or depict performance of any investment.  All investments carry a certain degree of risk, including possible loss of principal, and there is no assurance that an investment will provide positive performance over any period of time.  Different indices and economic periods will produce different results. Indices are unmanaged and unavailable for direct investment. Equity investments are subject to market risk or the risk that stocks will decline in response to such factors as adverse company news or industry developments or a general economic decline.  Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.  Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment.

The CBOE (Chicago Board of Exchange) Volatility Index® (VIX®) is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices. All indices are unmanaged and unavailable for direct investment.

Risks and Other Important Considerations
This information should not be relied upon as investment advice, recommendations, offers or solicitation of any particular security, asset class, fund, strategy, or investment product. Investing entails risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over any period of time. Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment. Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Equity investments such as large-cap stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline in response to adverse company news, industry developments, or a general economic decline. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Such statements may or may not be accurate over the long-term.

Santa Barbara Tax Products Group







Industry: Financial Services
Headquarters: San Diego, CA
Website: www.cisc.sbtpg.com



 Investment Overview:
Santa Barbara Tax Products Group (“Santa Barbara”) is a leading provider of financial products and processing services to the tax preparation industry.  Santa Barbara provides its services through third party tax preparation firms, including tax preparers and tax software providers.  Customers include Intuit’s TurboTax Online (the largest consumer online tax preparation software) and approximately 25,000 independent tax preparation offices.  In late 2014, Santa Barbara merged with Green Dot Corporation (NYSE: GDOT), the largest provider of prepaid debit card products and reloading services in the U.S.  The merger generated a significant cash return, while also providing the opportunity to benefit from the continued success of Santa Barbara through potential earn-out payments and as a significant GDOT shareholder.  The transaction, which included cash and GDOT stock, was valued at approximately $400 million.
 
 Transaction Background:
Santa Barbara's management team founded and led the Santa Barbara Bank & Trust tax processing division of Pacific Capital Bancorp ("Pacific Capital") for over 20 years. Pacific Capital was a Santa Barbara, CA based commercial and consumer bank that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the economic downturn. In response, Pacific Capital decided to sell the tax processing division in late 2009 to raise capital for its core banking operations.
Recognizing that Pacific Capital might need to sell the tax division to raise capital, Platform approached Pacific Capital in mid-2009 about acquiring the business in partnership with management. Platform was well positioned to make the acquisition because of our history investing in the tax industry through the IntelliTax division of our portfolio company, TRE Financial Services. IntelliTax had been a long-standing customer of Pacific Capital's tax division.
When Pacific Capital ultimately decided to sell the tax division, Platform was able to quickly negotiate the acquisition in partnership with management. The division was carved out from Pacific Capital and operated as a stand-alone business by Santa Barbara's management team.
