But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Princeton, NJ professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Princeton, NJ portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Princeton, NJ professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Princeton

How do I find the best Princeton architect for my home design project?It is best to hire a home architect who will be involved in all phases of the design process, from the initial concept to the completed construction. The architect is often the first person you will hire for your project. If necessary, they might also help you select and hire New Jersey subcontractors, which can include the builders, engineers and landscaper. Interior architects are also involved in negotiating contracts for all involved participants. It is for these reasons that it is extremely important for you to have a good relationship with the Princeton residential architect you hire. He or she can be the tie-breaking vote between you and the general contractor and can be your biggest advocate during the construction process. Different architecture firms in Princeton, NJ provide different services, so the scope of the work can span from pre-design environmental impact studies to selecting furniture and finishes, depending on what your specific needs are.What sort of process can I expect from a residential architect?As far as the process goes, the architecture firm or individual that you choose will start with concept drawings and finish with construction drawings and documents. Some firms even design with 3D renderings and videos, but that should not be assumed. There should be plenty of meetings between you and your building designer until you have agreed upon a design that you are completely happy with. Always keep in mind that the designer will have building codes to follow, and likely pre-existing design limitations when dealing with a remodel, so while they might not be able to execute your exact ideas they always have your safety and aesthetics in mind.  One of the most important duties of a residential architect is to serve as managers and supervise most aspects of construction, as well as facilitate communication between all other contractors, so you can expect them to be present throughout the entire building process to ensure everything is executed as planned.It is very important to hire the right professional for the job. Remember that the most well-known or established designer might not provide the best architectural services for your needs. It all comes down to the individual project. Research and ask people whose work you like for recommendations. It's important to have somewhat of an idea of the style of house architecture that you prefer, as well as the amount you would like to spend. Residential architects in Princeton, NJ are natural problem solvers. They will assess the entire situation and help you to solve your problems too. Don't settle for a single company too early. Call and interview a few. Make sure that you feel like your personalities will mesh well and that you like their professional perspective.Questions to ask prospective Princeton interior architects: What is your fee structure? What does the cost include? Do you have professional liability insurance? Can you handle my special requests (ADA, LEED etc.)? What types of renderings (3D, video, illustrative) will you produce? What is your experience with similar projects? When do you expect to start and be finished with the project? What do your services include? (It's best that the services are until construction is completed.) What happens when the cost exceeds the budget? Can you provide me with references? Would you say your work has a defining style? (This is important in case the architect's personal style will interfere with your vision.) Will you help with hiring a general contractor and subcontractors? What do you estimate the cost will be? What will I need to provide? Are there any complications you foresee with this project?Find a home architect in Princeton, NJ on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to Princeton architects. You may also look through photos of New Jersey projects to find interior architects and building designers who have worked on a project similar to yours.
