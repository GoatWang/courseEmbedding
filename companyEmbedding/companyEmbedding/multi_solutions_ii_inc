(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Multi Solutions II, Inc.'s Condensed Financial Statements and the related Notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. All statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein. Overview  Our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both domestic and international companies.  We have negative working capital, negative shareholders' equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since 2005. However, we have issued an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector Group Ltd. ("Vector"), a majority shareholder, in the principal amount of up to $450,000, as amended on June 3, 2015, which we believe provides us with access to sufficient capital for the next twelve months. We are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations. Our historical operating results disclosed in this Form 10-Q are not meaningful to our future results.  We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) investigating and analyzing business combinations; (ii) filing of Exchange Act reports, and (iii) consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as needed, to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors.  We may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations, a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company that does not need substantial additional capital, but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  Our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  MULTI SOLUTIONS II, INC.  We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of Multi Soft II, Inc., an entity under common control, each of our officers and directors has entered into an agreement with us and Multi Soft II, Inc. whereby they have each agreed that Multi Soft II, Inc. shall not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until we have agreed to consummate a business combination.  If we consummate a business combination, we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB"), and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the OTCBB subsequent to such business combination. In addition, subsequent to such business combination, we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several NASDAQ markets or the NYSE MKT, either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future. However, in 2011, the NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSE MKT adopted a "seasoning" requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies, which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels, with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing SEC filings during this time, although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least $40 million. We may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the $40 million exception, which could adversely impact our ability to access U.S. stock exchanges. There can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the OTCBB or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange or quotation service, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any of those or any other stock exchange or quotation service. If an active trading market for our shares does not develop, the value and liquidity of our shares will be materially and adversely affected.  Results of Operations  Comparison of Three Months Ended April 30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues. We did not generate revenues for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 were $9,775 and $6,875, respectively. During the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, such expenses consisted of professional fees associated with various corporation matters. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain low until such time as we effect a merger or other business combination with an operating business, if at all.  Other Expense. Other expense was $8,503 and $7,321 for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other expense for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 related to interest expense on the outstanding balance of the credit facility executed in April 2012.  MULTI SOLUTIONS II, INC.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We do not have any revenues from operations and, absent a merger or other combination with an operating company, or a public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured, we will be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from our present shareholders or management, for which there is no existing commitment. Although we have no present commitment from any such parties to provide funding aside from the Credit Facility, if we reach the point where we need funds to remain in operation, we will attempt to raise funds from our present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt. If, in such situation, we are unable to raise funds from those parties, it is likely that our business would cease operations. As of April 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $30,932, total liabilities of $443,109 and a negative working capital balance of approximately $4,300.  In April 2012 we entered into an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to $450,000, as amended on June 3, 2015, and the outstanding principal and interest balance owed to Vector as of April 30, 2016 was $407,909, including accrued interest of $98,712. We believe this revolving credit arrangement provides us with access to capital sufficient for the next twelve months. If we later determine that our capital reserves are insufficient, we will either cease operations or we will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares or through debt. There is no existing commitment to provide additional capital. In such situation, there can be no assurance that we shall be able to receive additional financing, and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing upon acceptable terms, it is likely that our business would cease operations.  Discussion of Cash Flows  For the three months ended April 30, 2016, net cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,875. Net cash used in operations was $3,875. For the three months ended April 30, 2016, no cash was provided by investing or financing activities.  For the three months ended April 30, 2015, net cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,875. Net cash used in operations was $3,875. For the three months ended April 30, 2015, no cash was provided by investing or financing activities.  Liquidity Sources  We satisfy our cash needs by drawing on the 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to $450,000, as amended on June 3, 2015 which had an outstanding principal and interest balance of $407,909 including accrued interest of $98,712 as of April 30, 2016.  We may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt, including loans from related parties, to acquire sufficient liquidity to satisfy our future liabilities. Such additional capital may not be available timely or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our plans to repay our liabilities as they become due may be impacted adversely by our inability to have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy our liabilities.  Contractual Obligations  As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this section.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.  MULTI SOLUTIONS II, INC.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Some of the statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q discuss future expectations, contain projections of our plan of operation or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words such as "anticipate", "plan", "believe", "expect", "estimate", and the like. Forward-looking statements involve future risks and uncertainties, there are factors that could cause actual results or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and is derived using numerous assumptions. A reader deciding whether to invest in our securities or not, should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example:   the success or failure of our efforts to implement our plan of operation;   our ability to fund our operating expenses;   our ability to compete with other companies that have a similar plan of operation;   the effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation;   our ability to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the SEC.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We believe the information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that date. We will not update that information except as required by law in the normal course of our public disclosure practices.  Additionally, the discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and related notes.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
