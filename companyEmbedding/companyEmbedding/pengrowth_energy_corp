How Much Time Does Pengrowth Energy Corp. Have Left?

Chris MacDonald | July 13, 2017 | More on:  PGH PGF








 




Many Canadian oil investors who have considered scraping the bottom of the barrel for value deals have looked at companies such as Pengrowth Energy Corp. (TSX:PGF)(NYSE:PGH) as deep-value opportunities, as many oil and gas companies operating within Canada are beginning to be valued closed to (or, in some cases, below) the breakup value of the asset base.

Long-term catalysts for the oil and gas sector appear to be few and far between with the vast majority of analysts believing that a “lower for longer” commodity price environment is more likely than a swift and sustained rebound in commodity prices.

Many Canadian oil investors who have considered scraping the bottom of the barrel for value deals have looked at companies such as Pengrowth Energy Corp.  (TSX:PGF)(NYSE:PGH) as deep-value opportunities, as many oil and gas companies operating within Canada are beginning to be valued closed to (or, in some cases, below) the breakup value of the asset base.
Long-term catalysts for the oil and gas sector appear to be few and far between with the vast majority of analysts believing that a “lower for longer” commodity price environment is more likely than a swift and sustained rebound in commodity prices.
The Canadian oil and gas sector in particular has been hit hard over the most recent quarters due to the unfavourable economics of the underlying Canadian oil and gas resource base compared to other oil deposits, which happen to be cheaper to extract and more profitable to sell.
On Wednesday, Pengrowth announced mixed results of the company’s initiative to sell off a portion of its oil assets to reduce its debt load. While Pengrowth was unable to secure a sale of its Swan Hills asset, the company did announce a confirmed $300 million sale of its Garrington/Olds assets in southern Alberta. The total amount expected to be raised from asset sales, which are scheduled to close this this year at $827 million, is a decent step in the right direction.
Analysts and investors have largely shown a mixed response to the news, with shares trading sideways, noting that while these asset sales do benefit the company in its bid to become profitable again and avoid bankruptcy, the cash flow generation of these assets which will be foregone may put the company at risk of breaching debt covenants linked to its debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
While many firms attempt to avoid asset sales as a way of reducing debt, looking primarily to equity issuances first as a way of re-balancing an over-levered capital structure with the stock prices of many Canadian oil and gas firms currently severely depressed to levels at or near book value, equity issuances become increasingly less attractive as the dilutive effect of such offerings can often be catastrophic for a company’s already rock-bottom share price.
Bottom line
The situation Pengrowth finds itself in is not a unique one, as many Canadian oil and gas firms have engaged in talks recently about asset sales. The ability of Pengrowth to generate cash flow over the near to medium term will be the primary factor for investors to pay close attention to moving forward. I would remain on the sidelines until it is clear that Pengrowth will be able to continue as a going concern, something which, according to my analysis, remains uncertain at this time.
Stay Foolish, my friends.

Breakthrough IPO Receives Rare Endorsement

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Don't Do The Pengrowth Energy Shuffle - Pengrowth Energy Corporation (NYSE:PGH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Don't Do The Pengrowth Energy ShuffleJul.12.17 | About: Pengrowth Energy (PGH) Long Player Long/short equity, value, special situations, contrarianSummaryThere is now a C$300 million sale that effectively replaces the terminated C$180 million sale.This new sale results in the sale of a significant amount of production, yet the annual cash flow guidance has not been adjusted.The company is still likely to violate its covenants in the third or fourth quarter without additional property sales.Most managements would shelve the expansion of Lindbergh with its WTI $46 breakeven and look for other, lower breakeven projects.The stock is still an avoid until a viable future plan appears.Pengrowth Energy (PGH) management has not improved their outlook with the recent announcement enough to make the stock a consideration. This stock remains a "run the other direction fast" consideration for the foreseeable future. Management announced the collapse of one of the agreements to sell part of the Swan Hills acreage for C$180 million. That important non-achievement was listed far below the top line achievement of selling other properties for C$300 million. That allowed management to "shuffle" sales so that Mr. Market's attention is now focused on the new sale. Time may be getting desperately short for these sales. But -- and this is a big deal -- this new sale "drew blood" which may be sign of the desperation of management. Plus the stock market reaction was absolutely nothing to get excited about today. The "blood" part: The Olds/Garrington area assets are expected to generate 2017 average daily production of 13,875 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe per day), and had Proved plus Probable (2P) reserves of 78 million boe as at December 31, 2016, as per the GLJ Petroleum Consultants independent reserve valuation dated December 31, 2016. The assets include facilities and gathering systems related to the oil and gas properties being sold, as well as the Olds Gas plant. That is some very serious production numbers for the size of this company. It was very interesting that management has not provided a new cash flow guidance as a result of this sale.
 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy Q1 2017 Earnings Press Release A significant production sale will most likely affect the above warning. It is very clear from the above that management needed to move fast when it became apparent that one of the Swan Hills deal would collapse. Since commodity prices are lower a second attempt to sell the Swan Hills properties is likely to bring a lower price. If and when the new deal closes (hopefully on schedule this time), the company will have an extra C$100 million. Whether or not that can bring the company into compliance with the lower commodity prices is still another key question management has not answered in the latest press releases. Judging by the timing of the announcements on the latest property sales, the answer may be that more sales are clearly needed. 

 Source: Pengrowth June 2017 Corporate Presentation Combine the sales effort with plans to expand the Lindbergh production. As shown above this project has a very high breakeven. In fact, it would lose money at current pricing. Why management would spend any money on such a project during a period of low pricing defies logic. The logic used to justify the project is faulty because many of the unconventional projects noted above are rapidly lowering the costs of new wells. There are far too many improvements sweeping the industry to rely on a chart like this. This project with the breakeven listed above is not competitive with many unconventional projects. Most managements would look at other company prospects during a low commodity price time like this and shelve any Lindbergh talk.
 This Lindbergh expansion needs sustained higher pricing for a reasonable return. But management has yet to demonstrate a profit even when prices were higher a few months back. Now commodity prices are sinking below assumptions. 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy Website - July 11, 2017 The latest press release decreases the production volume range by 2,000 BOED. Other than that, the other assumptions remain untouched so far. But it is clear that the WTI price of $55 and the AECO price of C$3.25 are too high. So the projected funds flow from operations probably will be a missed target. How much time management has to "right the ship" is unclear. That alone is reason enough to watch from the sidelines. The new sale has not changed production that significantly. But management plans to try to resell Swan Hills. So a potential new guidance without both Swan Hills as well as the current pending sale is indicated. A lower WTI assumption as well as a more realistic AECO natural gas price would help management's credibility. It would help if management were to state the dollar volume of sales needed to remove the covenant warning. There are a lot of moving parts here. It is very clear that management is scrambling. Management knew this future was possible yet did nothing to prevent the last minute crunch. So even though a bigger sale was announced to replace the sale that did not close, this stock should still be avoided. This management has a ways to go before a viable future can be presented. In fact, a lot more information needs to be available to potential investors before a reasonable assessment can be made.

Pengrowth Energy - Avoid For The Foreseeable Future - Pengrowth Energy Corporation (NYSE:PGH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pengrowth Energy - Avoid For The Foreseeable FutureJul.10.17 | About: Pengrowth Energy (PGH) Long Player Long/short equity, value, special situations, contrarianSummaryTwo Swan Hills asset sales were expected to close at the end of May. One of those sales worth C$180 million has not closed.The debt covenant warnings still apply because the WTI $60 assumption by the start of the third quarter is far away from reality.There has been very minimal cost reduction progress, so management could end up having to substantially pay off all the debt to avoid future problems.The time spent on the future thermal expansion and the failed high yield market debt attempt may cost shareholders dearly in the future.Competitors are reporting much better results with new gas wells than this management is forecasting.Pengrowth Energy (PGH) management announced the closing of the C$185 million sale of Swan Hills assets. Noticeably missing from the announcement is why the C$180 million sale, which was supposed to close by the end of May, is taking longer than expected. Instead there was a comment that management is still working to close the deal. Far more important though is progress to enhance cash flow. This is needed for the wonderful expansion plans that management keeps touting. The silence is deafening and that silence may imply that the stock has further to drop. In fact, this stock could go to zero without some very prompt substantial progress. Back on March 20, management announced a planned sale of some Central Alberta assets for about C$180 million. The expected closing date was May 30, 2017. We are now well past that deadline. Without a cognizant management explanation for the delay, the chances of a price decrease steadily increase. It does not help that commodity prices have been somewhat weak lately. 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy June, 2017, Corporate Update.
 This slide shows the debt situation, since the end of May, 2017. On June 2, 2017, management paid the remaining 2017 debt of C$135 million. The two pending sales of the Swan Hills properties were to pay much of the 2018 debt. Since management has also announced intentions to sell more assets, the investor can assume that the 2019 debt is also a targeted payment amount. 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy First Quarter, 2017, Earnings Press Release The reason for some market apprehension is the above statement. First, the oil based WTI has missed the targeted price of $60 per barrel beginning in the third quarter by a mile. Management may have wasted valuable time with their brief foray into a possible high yield debt. The closing delay may give both the lenders and the market some apprehension. One of the two anticipated Swan Hills closings will definitely help things along, but clearly this management needs a whole lot more focus. Despite all the debt payment progress, it is very clear that the warnings about covenant violations will still be material. For a management that has been steadily losing credibility this is a very unwelcome development. The debt payment progress probably will enable management to get at least a temporary extension that would allow for those covenant violations. But it may also pressure management to begin selling properties for lower prices. The beginning of the year featured much better commodity prices than now. So it is no surprise that not many property sales have been announced lately. But now, management may have no choice. They could have had more options had they focused on operations cost much more forcefully. (Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Specified)
 

 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy June, 2017, Corporate Update. This may be one of very few energy company presentations that does not have operational cost decrease as a major objective. Instead, management plans to expand the thermal production before the current thermal production shows a profit. In fact, a segmented cash flow statement and income statement is really not provided so shareholders can tell what if anything, is profitable. Instead management is guiding to reduced cash flow from operations and continuing high costs. Until the immediate covenant issues are resolved, any time spent on the anticipated thermal expansion is wasted time. Instead, this management should be high grading its prospects and drilling some spectacular wells. This company clearly could use more cash flow to escape the financial distress. (Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Stated) 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy June, 2017, Corporate Update. Therefore the growth strategy shown above is looking much less viable. First, expanding a money losing division does not make sense. Second, if there is any part of the company that can be quickly turned around, it has to be the Cardium and Montney unconventional business.
 Even the reserves that management has touted appear to be at risk. As long as production is high cost, then reserves tend to suffer downward revisions as commodity prices retreat. Right now, those commodity prices are clearly retreated. This management needed some commodity price help that it is not getting. So now the CEO needs to clearly state the Plan "B" to reassure the market and carry that plan out convincingly. 

 

 Source: Pengrowth Energy June, 2017, Corporate Update. The first slide shows where the argument falls apart. First of all the assumed WTI pricing is much too high. Many competitors have much better returns at far lower WTI Pricing. Management had originally cashed in all the hedging and established new hedges during the first quarter. So the AECO assumptions are absolutely critical. But like the oil prices, they are on the optimistic side. Frankly, this company has some catching-up to do. Nearby operators are doing far better than that top slide. If this is the growth potential, then this company needs new wells that provide adequate returns much lower than the prices shown above. Last year, much of the cash flow came from the hedging operation. But management was supposed to use that time to reduce operating costs low enough that the company could survive once the hedges were gone. Clearly that has not happened. The net result may be that management will have to sell enough assets to substantially pay down the debt. The lack of operational progress may destroy any substantial kind of necessary banking relationship. Bankers will most likely place this company on a very short leash until adequate progress is shown. In any event, this stock, which could have turned around had management shown some operational progress, will now probably continue to decline. The stock remains a far better short candidate than a long candidate. The story should have been different by now. But management clings to the "good old days" which are now gone. Long term investors probably need to look elsewhere as there are much better long term candidates out there.
 Both Peyto (OTCPK:PEYUF) and Tourmaline (OTCPK:TRMLF) are relatively low cost survivors with a decent future. Peyto pays a decent dividend, but Tourmaline has ventured into some liquids production. Both gas producers rate to do much better than Pengrowth even though they operate in geographically similar areas. Neither is that far away from the Pengrowth operations. If some oil production is not a worry, then Yangarra Resources (OTCPK:YGRAF) is smaller and more speculative, but also doing well in the current industry climate. Its balance sheet may throw some investors for a loop because it deposits all cash into the revolving line and then pays bills from that revolving line. So, the company has a substantial working capital deficit and no cash balance. However, the bank just increased the credit line and production is up nicely to go with some generous netbacks. In any case, until Pengrowth Energy management shows a lot more progress this might be a stock to just avoid for the foreseeable future. There has been more than enough time to show improvement on a number of fronts. But this management always waits until its "back is against the wall." There is just no realistic foresight and shareholders keep paying for it.

Light Oil and SAGD Portfolio » Pengrowth Energy Corporation























Our Projects




Where Pengrowth is Today and Where We Are Growing
It's an exciting time to be in the oil and gas industry, with fascinating opportunities unfolding at Pengrowth. While maintaining our conventional assets, including Swan Hills light oil, Greater Olds / Garrington light oil and Montney natural gas at Groundbirch, we also focus our attention on our Lindbergh Thermal Project, located in East Central Alberta, near Cold Lake.
 
Our operational expertise is in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. We rely on this expertise to help offset production declines in our conventional oil and natural gas properties as well as develop new production in less mature properties. Our inventory of undeveloped land provides drilling and development opportunities for the short, mid and long-term. Our strategy is to leverage our expertise with these development opportunities to exploit large accumulations of oil, bitumen and natural gas with low declines and low cost structures.
Our Barbell Strategy for Sustainable Growth
With our diverse geographical locations across the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, Pengrowth's current assets consist of an even balance between oil and gas as well as thermal and conventional assets. This balance allows for flexibility in fluctuating market conditions by providing commodity and capital optionality.

July 2016 Options Now Available For Pengrowth Energy (PGH)
Investors in Pengrowth Energy Corp saw new options become available today, for the July 2016 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

Pengrowth Energy Corporation is a Canadian oil and natural gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. Established in 1988 by Calgary entrepreneur James S Kinnear, it was one of the largest of the Canadian royalty trusts ("Canroys"), with a market capitalization of US$4.12 billion at the end of 2007. Its assets are approximately evenly distributed between oil and natural gas.[2][3]
Pengrowth's assets are in the Western Canada sedimentary basin, a geologic region which has a long history of productivity in crude oil and natural gas. In addition to the properties in western Canada, the company has assets in the Atlantic Ocean off of Nova Scotia. Pengrowth produces petroleum ranging from heavy crude oil to light oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Proved reserves as of 2006 were reported to be 200 million barrels (32,000,000 m3) of oil equivalent (boe) with an additional 160 million barrels (25,000,000 m3) of probable reserves. Average daily production in 2006 was 62,821 barrels per day (9,987.7 m3/d) (bpd) with a projected amount of 86,000 to 87,000 for 2007; figures verifying these totals should be released in early 2008 (those estimates for 2007 ended up being fairly accurate, that year Pengrowth produced 87,401 boe per day, the highest for any annual period between 2005 and 2009, also in 2007 natural gas made up the highest percentage for any of those years (51%)).[4] In 2009 total production averaged 79,519 boe/d (29.0 million barrels for the year) of which 49,126 (61.78%) was natural gas related, 22,841 (28.72%) was crude oil and the rest 7,551 (9.50%) heavy oil.[5]
In addition to traditional oil and gas reservoirs, Pengrowth also is expanding its operations into oil sands and coalbed methane.[6]
Pengrowth Energy Trust pays a high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 15.9% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since Pengrowth's assets are considered a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.[7] In December 2015 the company suspended all dividends as it struggles to fund the upcoming Bond payoffs.
The Pengrowth Saddledome, home to the Calgary Flames of the NHL, used to be named after the company until 2010 when Scotiabank took over there naming rights. Scotiabank also formerly sponsored Scotiabank Place, which is home of the Ottawa Senators. In 2013, the arena was renamed Canadian Tire Centre.

Pengrowth Energy Corporation is a Canadian oil and natural gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. Established in 1988 by Calgary entrepreneur James S Kinnear, it was one of the largest of the Canadian royalty trusts ("Canroys"), with a market capitalization of US$4.12 billion at the end of 2007. Its assets are approximately evenly distributed between oil and natural gas.[2][3]
Pengrowth's assets are in the Western Canada sedimentary basin, a geologic region which has a long history of productivity in crude oil and natural gas. In addition to the properties in western Canada, the company has assets in the Atlantic Ocean off of Nova Scotia. Pengrowth produces petroleum ranging from heavy crude oil to light oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Proved reserves as of 2006 were reported to be 200 million barrels (32,000,000 m3) of oil equivalent (boe) with an additional 160 million barrels (25,000,000 m3) of probable reserves. Average daily production in 2006 was 62,821 barrels per day (9,987.7 m3/d) (bpd) with a projected amount of 86,000 to 87,000 for 2007; figures verifying these totals should be released in early 2008 (those estimates for 2007 ended up being fairly accurate, that year Pengrowth produced 87,401 boe per day, the highest for any annual period between 2005 and 2009, also in 2007 natural gas made up the highest percentage for any of those years (51%)).[4] In 2009 total production averaged 79,519 boe/d (29.0 million barrels for the year) of which 49,126 (61.78%) was natural gas related, 22,841 (28.72%) was crude oil and the rest 7,551 (9.50%) heavy oil.[5]
In addition to traditional oil and gas reservoirs, Pengrowth also is expanding its operations into oil sands and coalbed methane.[6]
Pengrowth Energy Trust pays a high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 15.9% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Pengrowth Energy Corporation is a Canadian oil and natural gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. Established in 1988 by Calgary entrepreneur James S Kinnear, it was one of the largest of the Canadian royalty trusts ("Canroys"), with a market capitalization of US$4.12 billion at the end of 2007. Its assets are approximately evenly distributed between oil and natural gas.[2][3]
Pengrowth's assets are in the Western Canada sedimentary basin, a geologic region which has a long history of productivity in crude oil and natural gas. In addition to the properties in western Canada, the company has assets in the Atlantic Ocean off of Nova Scotia. Pengrowth produces petroleum ranging from heavy crude oil to light oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Proved reserves as of 2006 were reported to be 200 million barrels (32,000,000 m3) of oil equivalent (boe) with an additional 160 million barrels (25,000,000 m3) of probable reserves. Average daily production in 2006 was 62,821 barrels per day (9,987.7 m3/d) (bpd) with a projected amount of 86,000 to 87,000 for 2007; figures verifying these totals should be released in early 2008 (those estimates for 2007 ended up being fairly accurate, that year Pengrowth produced 87,401 boe per day, the highest for any annual period between 2005 and 2009, also in 2007 natural gas made up the highest percentage for any of those years (51%)).[4] In 2009 total production averaged 79,519 boe/d (29.0 million barrels for the year) of which 49,126 (61.78%) was natural gas related, 22,841 (28.72%) was crude oil and the rest 7,551 (9.50%) heavy oil.[5]
In addition to traditional oil and gas reservoirs, Pengrowth also is expanding its operations into oil sands and coalbed methane.[6]
Pengrowth Energy Trust pays a high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 15.9% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since Pengrowth's assets are considered a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.[7] In December 2015 the company suspended all dividends as it struggles to fund the upcoming Bond payoffs.
The Pengrowth Saddledome, home to the Calgary Flames of the NHL, used to be named after the company until 2010 when Scotiabank took over there naming rights. Scotiabank also formerly sponsored Scotiabank Place, which is home of the Ottawa Senators. In 2013, the arena was renamed Canadian Tire Centre.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
