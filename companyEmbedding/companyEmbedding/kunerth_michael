Bill Kunerth: Journalism and Justice








Warren Riedesel, (right) marketing communications manager for the corn seed product line at Pioneer Hi-Bred, reunited with his former journalism professor Bill Kunerth, in 2010.  “Kunerth was still fighting the fight to make things right,” Riedesel said.Decorated World War II veteran, inspiring journalism instructor and defender of the First Amendment are just a few roles that describe William F. (Bill) Kunerth. A native of Belle Fourche, S.D., Kunerth devoted his life to his students, community and his profession before he passed away on Dec. 9, 2013.Kunerth left a tremendous legacy behind him. He dedicated 31 years to his career as a journalism professor at Iowa State University and made a huge impact on his students and on its community.“I am convinced that Bill was the most important and significant force on journalism (including the Daily) at Iowa State from 1957 to 1988 – and beyond, as well,” said Tom Emmerson, a former ISU journalism colleague of Kunerth. “I cannot image what Iowa State would be like if he hadn’t been around to keep people on their toes.”Kunerth was a champion of the First Amendment, and he wasn’t afraid to ruffle a few feathers. In September 2000, Kunerth supported a bill to open records of the nonprofit foundations established by state universities. The case involved the Iowa State University Foundation, the private fundraising arm of Iowa State University.A drawn out lawsuit followed with the intention of forcing the ISU Foundation to make its records public. Thanks to the efforts of Kunerth and many others, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that the ISU Foundation must disclose its records.In addition to battling the ISU Foundation, Kunerth fought the Iowa Board of Regents from selling WOI-TV, the university-owned station. WOI-TV was the first television station owned and operated by a U.S. higher education institution. The station allowed Iowa State to be a pioneer in broadcasting college-level courses and using television for educational purposes.Kunerth was an advocate of the Iowans for WOI-TV organization that opposed the Iowa Board of Regents’ decision. Despite the organization’s determination and public support, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Board of Regents in 1993. In March 1994, Iowa State University sold WOI-TV to Capital Cities Communications, Inc., the parent company of ABC Television.Kunerth was persistent and not afraid to challenge violations of the First Amendment that affected the public. He also understood the importance of promoting a good cause. Kunerth believed in the impact of the Jack Trice story and made a point to keep the name alive.On Wednesday, Apr. 16, Bill Kunerth will be recognized by the Greenlee School of Journalism with the Champion of the First Amendment Award. A ceremony will be held in the Great Hall of the Memorial Union at 3 p.m to pay tribute to Kunerth’s legacy at Iowa State. Friends, family and students are invited to attend and share their thoughts and memories about the former Greenlee professor.Greenlee School Director Michael Bugeja is among the speakers scheduled to present at the tribute. Following Kunerth’s passing, Bugeja expressed his thoughts about his fellow journalist.“Bill taught the old values, investigation, in-depth writing, public records and disclosures. As a journalist, he did many things. As a teacher he inspired hundreds to continue that legacy, and they're doing it across the country. That's the enduring contribution of Bill,” Bugeja said.The Kunerth tribute is part of a university-wide celebration known as First Amendment Day. First Amendment Day recognizes the value of the five freedoms granted in the U.S. Constitution. It is sponsored by Lee Enterprises and the Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication.
