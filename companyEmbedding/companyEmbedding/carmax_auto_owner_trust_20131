For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3
    





August 08, 2013 03:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to CarMax Auto Owner Trust 
      2013-3:
    

      --$178,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$321,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$128,500,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,500,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,000,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,000,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2013-3 has consistent credit quality compared 
      to recent 2013 pools. The weighted average FICO score is 700 with 
      consistent internal credit tiers, while vehicle age, condition and LTV's 
      are slightly above recent 2013 pools.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CarMax Auto 
      Finance's (CAF) portfolio and 2009-2012 securitizations have declined in 
      recent years due to stronger quality originations and elevated used 
      vehicle values, which have supported higher recovery rates.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution in 2013-3 is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) in 2013-3 
      for the class A notes totals 6.70%, up from 5.70% in 2013-2 and 2013-1. 
      CE is adequate to cover Fitch's base case loss coverage levels.
    

      Unstable Macroeconomic Conditions: A slower recovery and potential for 
      volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis 
      accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the 
      recent recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: Fitch believes 
      CAF demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer to service 2013-3.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential 
      downgrades of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. Each class of notes could experience downgrades of up to three 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
