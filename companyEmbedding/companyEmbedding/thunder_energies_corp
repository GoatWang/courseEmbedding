Corporate Presentation Video         TEC Neutron Source         TEC Hyper-Combustion

new technologies for a new era



NUCLEAR

Division of Nuclear Equipment (TEC-DNE)
The production, promotion, sale and service of the Santilli Thermal Neutron Source is based on a novel synthesis of the neutron from a hydrogen gas (international patent pending). It was believed that neutrons are synthesized from the hydrogen solely in the core of stars. Recent studies via Hadronic mathematics and physics have achieved for the first time the laboratory synthesis of the neutron from a hydrogen gas. This equipment produces thermal neutrons at moderate cost that is important for national security as well as for scientific and industrial applications.

COMBUSTION

Division of Combustion Equipment (TEC-DCE)
The production, promotion, sale and service of the novel HyperFurnace which achieves the full combustion of fossil fuels as well as an enhanced energy output (patented and international patents pending). Combustion has essentially remained the same for thousands of years. New technologies today can achieve a combustion of fossil fuels without the exhaust of combustible contaminants. In addition to alleviating environmental problems, Santilli combustion increases the energy output of fossil fuel combustion.

OPTICAL

Division of Optical Equipment (TEC-DOE)
The production, promotion, sale and service of pairs of Galileo telescopes with convex lenses to detect matter-galaxies & Santilli telescopes with concave lenses to detect antimatter-galaxies (international patent pending). The universe was believed to be comprised galaxies solely made up of matter. Research has shown that this was due to the inspection of the night sky with Galileo telescope with convex lenses, since the inspection of the night sky with Santilli revolutionary telescope with concave lenses has identified for the first time antimatter galaxies.

Thunder Energies Corporation has previously presented confirmations of the apparent existence of antimatter galaxies, antimatter asteroids and antimatter cosmic rays detected in preceding tests. In this breaking news, Thunder Energies presents evidence for the existence of Invisible Terrestrial Entities (ITE) of the dark and bright type (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFvz5TGw0_0&index=6&list=PLdA-dZtlMHMaeL-9XZyVnN7yvcW-ZxwRP).Pamela Fleming states: "The detection occurred at 8:45 pm, using a pair of 70 mm Galileo and Santilli telescopes from the 4th floor of the Marriott Hotel, facing the Tax Collector building in Tallahassee, Florida. No anomalous entities were detected with the Galileo Telescope with conventional convex lenses, whereas the anomalous entities were fully visible in the screen of the digital camera attached to the Santilli telescope with concave lenses. I believe that these anomalous entities are a good candidate for Invisible Terrestrial Entities of the second kind because they emitted isodual light, which can only be focused with the Santilli Telescope with concave lens," (http://www.thunder-energies.com/index.php/ct-menu-item-18/11-articles/17-article-8).Pamela Fleming adds: "The entities disappeared from view in the Santilli Telescope two hours after the initial detection, without any change in the public city lighting that was surrounding the Tax Collector building. Thunder Energies Corporation believes that this detection confirms the usefulness of the new surveillance of civilian, industrial and governmental facilities permitted by our pair of Galileo and Santilli Telescopes, since they can record all possible anomalies not visible with conventional binoculars or telescopes," (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CNW8E5K/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=).View photosView photosView photosRead MoreAbout Thunder Energies Corp:Thunder Energies Corporation is a breakthrough technology company featuring three cutting edge technologies in the fields of optics, nuclear physics and fuel combustion.
