The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.

SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2011, ORBCOMM has acquired a number of companies including:

StarTrak Systems
In 2011 ORBCOMM acquired StarTrak and its ReeferTrak and GenTrak brands, including devices and applications for tracking refrigerated trailers, assets and gensets. StarTrak’s customers included refrigerated unit manufacturers such as Carrier and Thermo King as well as companies such as Tropicana, Maersk Line, Prime Inc, CR England, FFE Transport, Inc. and Exel Transportation.
PAR Logistics Management Systems

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

ORBCOMM: The Stars Align In 2017 - ORBCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:ORBC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»ORBCOMM: The Stars Align In 2017Apr.25.17 | About: ORBCOMM Inc. (ORBC) Gary Milne Special situations, Growth, long-term horizonSummaryProduct shipments in Q1 will exceed expectations and lead to a revenue beat.Deals with J.B. Hunt and U.S. Postal Service will yield 100,000+ new subs and hardware in 2017. This represents 65% of 2016 organic growth sold by the end of February.Partnerships with CIMC and Carrier Transicold will yield manufacturer-installed ORBCOMM solutions.High-margin AIS revenue is steadily increasing each quarter.When my first article on ORBCOMM (NASDAQ:ORBC) was published in August 31, 2016, the stock traded around $10.00, and it is still there today. In the interim period, the stock has traded as high as $10.98 and as low as $7.15, when the market overreacted to a Q3 miss. Timing is always the hardest part when it comes to growth stories, and ORBCOMM has proven no exception. While 2016 was disappointing in terms of stock performance, most of it came down to issues with product shipments in Q3 and Q4, which we will discuss later. In this article, I lay out my reasons why 2017 should be a year of increased growth and strong results for the company. Sturdy Growth in 2017 At the end of February 2017, ORBCOMM was selected by J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) to equip its 90,000-plus intermodal and over-the-road (OTR) trailing fleets with end-to-end tracking and monitoring. This is a huge deal for the company, both in terms of product and service revenue. In addition, AT&T closed a deal with the U.S. Postal Service, which utilizes ORBCOMM's solution for tracking Postal Service assets. On the Q4 earnings call, Marc Eisenberg, the CEO, referred to this deal as "tens of thousands of units at AT&T/U.S. Postal Service," and later as "... that could be tens of thousands of units with an upside of 40,000 over the next year or two." The significance of these two deals is best understood in terms of ORBCOMM's typical organic growth, as shown below. 


 Using 100,000 units for these combined deals accounts for 65% of their 2016 organic growth being booked by the end of February 2017. It appears highly likely that 2017 new subscriber numbers (and product revenue) will handily beat those for 2016. It should be noted that the implementation of these new customers will not be linear throughout the year, and the CEO cited the J.B. Hunt implementation as an example: "So there is a portion of the year that J.B. Hunt stacks a lot of trailers in Q2, Q3 and we've got to zoom ahead to get as many installed in those quarters as we can."- Marc Eisenberg, Q4 Earnings Call These two deals represent a dream start for 2017 that should bode well for sturdy growth in subs and product. Food Safety Management Act - The Second Wave I detailed in my prior article the significance of the FSMA, and I won't repeat that here. What is important is that the FSMA has two significant compliance dates for "Sanitary Transportation". There are a few exceptions, but in essence, it looks like this:  March 31, 2017 - Carriers with greater than 500 employees March 31, 2018 - Carriers with less than 500 employees  The first date has passed, and ORBCOMM has been very successful in converting numerous large refrigerated shippers into customers. The second date, March 31, 2018, applies to all small carriers across the nation with less than 500 employees. "We believe FSMA will continue to generate strong demand for our industry leading cold chain solutions"- Marc Eisenberg, Q4 Earnings Call This second wave of demand will grow throughout 2017 and ORBCOMM is perfectly situated to benefit from it. The Product Business ORBCOMM's financial reports break revenue down into Services and Products, which have an approximate 60/40 split. Over the last two quarters, product revenues have been below company guidance and the major contributor to revenue misses in both quarters. In Q3, service revenues increased 15% over the prior-year period to $28.8 million. Product Sales of $17.4 million were ($3.6) million or 17% lower than the prior-year period. In the Q3 earnings call, management gave several reasons for the shortfall.
    "First, we've now moved the majority of our products to a new contract manufacturer in Mexico. While this was a necessary change due to the pricing advantages we will be seeing, it wasn't without some glitches." "We had a number of incomplete system shipped, which prevented us from recognizing a significant amount of revenue." "A second issue we ran into was that we had distribution partners that pushed some of their deployments."  In Q4, product sales picked up, but the anticipated rebound from the Q3 backlog did not materialize, and again, the numbers fell short of expectations. From the Q4 press release: "Product Sales during the fourth quarter of 2016 were $17.4 million compared to $17.9 million during the same period last year, decreasing ($0.5) million or 2.5%. Product Sales were lower largely due to the timing of deployments and delays in obtaining the required LTE product certifications, which resulted in a shift of about 10,000 units of backlog or $3-4 million to the first quarter of 2017." With certification of its new LTE module completed in late December, the company finally looks set to clear the majority of its backlog in Q1 2017. These circumstances should setup ORBCOMM for strong product sales in Q1 2017. Analysts Have Conservative Expectations In the 2016 Q4 earnings call, management gave the following guidance for full-year 2017:  Service Revenue: $118-122 million Product Revenue: $80-110 million  By comparison, 2016 revenues were $112.8 million for Services and $78.3 million for Product. Growth in subscriber revenue is predictable as new subs are added, and the tight range given is relatively easy to predict. In Q4 2016, Service revenues were $29.4 million. Taking a typical $250,000 quarterly increase in Service revenue yields $29.65 million for Q1 2017. A quick look at the analyst estimates from Yahoo Finance shows us that combined revenue for Q1 is expected to be $48.67 million. 


 Product sales is by far the more variable number, so let us take a closer look at that. If we deduct the $29.65 million from $48.67 million, we are left with an estimate of $19 million in Q1 product sales. With $17.4 million in product revenue in Q4 2016, it means the average analyst is expecting a rebound of only $1.6 million in product sales. Compare this to earlier in the year where product sales rebounded from $16.6 million in Q1 to $22.4 million in Q2, an increase of $5.8 million, due to shipping delays in Q1. Given the product backlog going into 2017 (cited as $3-4 million in the Q4 press release), certification of the company's new LTE module in December and two large deals already signed, it seems quite likely that ORBCOMM will beat on product sales, which will lead to an overall revenue beat for Q1. Growth in Automatic Identification System (AIS) AIS is a system that broadcasts a ship's identification, position and other data. This system is mandated by the International Maritime Organization on all large vessels. ORBCOMM continues to expand its footprint in this space as its partners close deals with agencies around the world.  ORBCOMM's partner Kordia awarded multi-year contract by Australian Maritime Safety Authority ORBCOMM's partner Maerospace awarded multi-year contract for the Canadian government  In the Q4 earnings call, the CFO made this comment on AIS growth: "AIS revenues, now at $1.8 million per quarter, are trending over $7 million on an annual run rate heading toward our expected $10 million to $15 million per year." This segment of the business keeps growing steadily. Its high-margin nature gives it an oversized contribution to the bottom line. Strategic Partnerships ORBCOMM has two partnerships which will make a highly significant contribution to growth over the next few years. The first is CIMC, the largest manufacturer of shipping containers in the world. See my prior article for more information on shipping containers. Here is how Marc Eisenberg described the status of the relationship in the Q4 earnings call:
 "Well there's no factory installs yet with CIMC. But CIMC is - they've committed to 50,000 units per year first couple of years. Their product is just about ready, they're out there pitching the deal, pitching their deals on an aftermarket basis. And you know their expectation, you know they've committed to 100,000 in year three and 250,000 in year four." The second is Carrier Transicold, the biggest name in refrigerated transportation. Together, they have built a Carrier-branded OEM solution. These are going in after-market, but will come as a factory-installed option in the future. This was Marc Eisenberg's update in the Q4 earnings call:    "We're continuing to make progress in the launch of our customized cold chain telematics solution for Carrier Transicold, truck and trailer transport refrigeration units." "We started shipping to Carrier in Q4. Carrier believes there is significant demand through their dealer network in North America and expect this to be followed by some factory installs in early 2018."  Having leading manufacturers build an ORBCOMM solution into their product makes the company a strong incumbent that is harder to displace. It also generates new subscribers and regular product sales without the overhead of the typical sales process. Conclusion For the past decade, ORBCOMM has evangelised its solution for tracking and monitoring assets on a global basis, as a seller in search of buyers. Now the landscape is shifting, and fleet management, telematics and cold chain monitoring are all becoming essential to the smooth and cost-efficient operation of the supply chain. Buyer resistance is fading, and selling the ORBCOMM solution has never been easier. The en masse adoption by large fleets like J.B. Hunt, Maersk (OTCPK:AMKAF) and Carrier demonstrate this technology has moved from a futuristic nicety into the realm of common business necessity. The average subscriber monthly fee at ORBCOMM is $5.68 - a number which is dwarfed by the value of operational efficiencies it delivers. As ORBCOMM's solution shifts to a competitive necessity, it would appear the pricing structure offers opportunity to increase revenue without significantly impairing the value proposition to the customer.
 The year is off to a great start with the J.B. Hunt and U.S. Postal Service deals. Add to that the resolution of product shipment issues from Q3/Q4, and ORBCOMM looks set to deliver in 2017.

					Full Description



ORBCOMM Inc., incorporated on October 16, 2003, is a provider of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, including network connectivity, devices, device management and Web reporting applications. The Company's IoT products and services are designed to track, monitor and manage security for a range of assets, such as trailers, trucks, rail cars, sea containers, generators, fluid tanks, marine vessels, diesel or electric powered generators (gensets), oil and gas wells, pipeline monitoring equipment, irrigation control systems, and utility meters, in industries for transportation and supply chain, heavy equipment, fixed asset monitoring, maritime and government. Additionally, the Company provides Automatic Identification System (AIS) data services to assist in vessel navigation and to manage maritime safety for government and commercial customers across the world. The Company provides its services using various network platforms, including its own constellation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and its accompanying ground infrastructure, as well as terrestrial-based cellular communication services obtained through reseller agreements with cellular wireless providers.The Company's satellite-based customer solution offerings use small, low power, mobile satellite subscriber communicators for remote asset connectivity, and its terrestrial-based solutions utilize cellular data modems with subscriber identity modules (SIMs). It also resells service using the two-way Inmarsat satellite network to provide bandwidth, satellite products and services, engaging its IsatDataPro (IDP) technology. Its customer solutions provide access to data gathered over these systems through connections to other public or private networks, including the Internet. Its IoT data communications services are provided by offering a combination of both satellite and terrestrial networks, including its LEO satellite constellation, consisting of its ORBCOMM Generation 1 (OG1) and AIS equipped OG2 satellites operating in the very high frequency (VHF) band, third-party LEO constellations.The Company utilizes its ORBCOMMConnect Platform to translate and integrate the communications from its range of network service partners into a manageable set of commands and responses and information transport. This creates a common user platform for provisioning, billing and multi-mode access for IoT applications and enables access to network and terminal management tools for wholesale integration with its network. The Company provides its customers a subscriber component, which consists of satellite subscriber communicators and cellular terrestrial units, or wireless modems incorporating SIMS, used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and its system. In addition, its Web applications provide specialized data feeds that are established through its application gateway interface to third-party dispatch systems and customer software applications to provide customers data and analytics from telematics products and specialized sensors.The data is transferred to either a subscriber communicator, or a terrestrial-based wireless device using a SIM on the partner cellular provider's network. If the data is transferred to a satellite subscriber communicator, data is transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view in near real-time. The data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station (GES) that it connects to, which in turn forwards it to the ORBCOMM gateway control center (GCC). Within the GCC, the data is processed, safe-stored and forwarded to its ultimate destination and, if requested, an acknowledgment that the message content has been received is transmitted back to the subscriber communicators. If the data is transferred to a cellular device, data is routed through the partner carrier's network through a virtual private network (VPN) to the ORBCOMM GCC and forwarded to its destination in real time. The destination for transferred data may be another subscriber communicator, a SIM, a corporate resource management system, various personal or business Internet e-mail address, a pager or a text message-capable cellular phone, or various other combinations. In addition, data can be sent in the reverse direction (a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets) using similar methods.The Company competes with Iridium Communications Inc. and Globalstar, Inc.

Orbcomm: Devices + Network + Apps = Internet Of Things - ORBCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:ORBC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Orbcomm: Devices + Network + Apps = Internet Of ThingsAug.31.16 | About: ORBCOMM Inc. (ORBC) Gary Milne Special situations, Growth, long-term horizonSummaryRecent deals with CIMC, Maersk and Carrier demonstrate a pivotal point in market evolution.Food Safety Management Act creating large wave of opportunity in refrigerated shipping and distribution.Satellite launch risk is removed and satellite network capacity has increased 10X.Very impressive portfolio of satellite and cellular partners, hardware products, SaaS solutions and industry leading customers.Verizon showing interest in Internet of Things solution players. Introduction Long before the "Internet of Things" became a technology term and investing buzzword Orbcomm (NASDAQ:ORBC) was connecting terrestrial objects such as shipping containers and construction equipment (things) to the internet via its satellite network. Orbcomm is perceived as a satellite company but really has 3 things to sell.  Devices that send status message over a network. Two way communications over their satellite or partner cellular network. A range of industry specific Software as a Service applications.  Putting these three things together and we get Devices + Network + Apps. Think that over for a minute! Devices that communicate over a network to software that monitors/reports/changes based on what it sees. That sounds like a dictionary definition for the Internet of Things. However, Orbcomm is largely seen as a satellite company with a small subscriber network when in fact it is at the nexus of three technologies that are all central to the IoT revolution. IoT devices, networking and SaaS solutions. Read on to see why I believe Orbcomm is poised to rapidly grow their subscriber and enterprise solutions base over the 1-2 years, especially in the areas of shipping and distribution. This article does not evaluate the present financials of Orbcomm or make estimates on future share price. The goal is to evaluate the company and the potential market for their goods and services. Orbcomm's Background Orbcomm has a long history dating back to its origins as Orbital Sciences Inc. in 1993 and has operated a satellite network since 2000. In 2001, it was acquired by new ownership and became a public company in 2006. Through a process of organic growth and an aggressive acquisition strategy, ORBC now has 1.6M+ subscribers and expects annual revenues for 2016 around $200M. 

 ORBC Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts Revenue Sources Hardware: These are the communication devices that gather data from a physical object on the ground and transmit the data to the nearest orbiting satellite (or via cellular). Hardware accounts for about 45% of their revenue. Network Services: Orbcomm has over 1.2M subscribers for their network services. Subscribers pay a monthly fee to use the Orbcomm network which includes their own satellite or partner terrestrial cellular networks. Enterprise Solutions: Orbcomm has 450,000 subscribers to their enterprise solutions which provide turnkey SaaS applications to companies in the transportation and distribution business (trucking, shipping and intermodal) as well as solutions for heavy equipment and SCADA system. Remember, Devices + Network + Apps = Internet of Things The Orbcomm Network December 2015 saw the completed launch of 11 new OG2 satellites, bringing the total to 17 OG2 satellites and 25 OG1 satellites, which are still operating after 17 years in service. Each OG2 satellite has the capacity of 12 OG1 satellites and also supports much larger message sizes. Improvements in the OG2 satellites allow the terrestrial devices to be smaller and use less power. The successful launch of these satellites was a large risk that has now been eliminated. In addition to the 42 Orbcomm owned satellites, Orbcomm also has agreements with Inmarsat and Globalstar to ensure global coverage even in countries such as China and Russia where licenses are almost impossible to obtain. In addition to satellite modems, Orbcomm also sells cellular and dual mode devices to accommodate the broadest range of a customer's need. The Orbcomm cellular solution works with: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Orange, Rogers, Telefonica and Vodafone. The global network is built, the biggest risk is off the table and network capacity has increased at least ten-fold. The network is ready to scale up dramatically from its 1.2 million network subscribers with minimal incremental capex investment. The Orbcomm Solution Orbcomm provides a global solution that allows its customers to monitor any kind of asset regardless of its physical location. The main uses at present are:  Transportation: Trailers, shipping containers, fleet and driver management, intermodal containers. Sample customers are Wal-Mart, CIMC, Maersk, Carrier, Union Pacific, Hub Group. Heavy Equipment: Construction and agriculture. Sample customers are John Deere, Komatsu, Caterpillar, Hyundai, Volvo. Monitoring and Control: Remote industrial infrastructure such as Oil and Gas, Electrical grid, water and waste management.  A simple example: A refrigerated container carries perishable goods. With an Orbcomm solution, the container can continuously transmit information such as location, temperature, humidity, power, fuel, door open/close events to a central monitoring station. Should the temperature go outside specified limits, a technician can be dispatched to resolve the issue before the load spoils. The Opportunity In Shipping InterModal Containers The global capacity for intermodal shipping containers in 2012 was estimated to be 34 million TEU. A TEU is a Twenty Foot Equivalent container so a 40 foot container = 2 TEU. While the exact number of containers is unknown, 25 million is a reasonable estimate. In 2015, the new container capacity added was estimated at 3 million TEU and another 2 million TEU for replacement of lost/damaged/retired containers. This places the number of new containers built each year at 2-3 million containers. China International Marine Corp. is the world's largest builder of containers (China produces ~90% of world supply) estimated to be around 50% of the world supply, or approximately 1.25 million units each year. In November of 2015, CIMC selected Orbcomm to build an OEM solution for CIMC which went into testing in early 2016. The potential opportunity here is huge relative to their current subscriber base. Refrigerated Containers (Reefers) Maersk, one the largest shippers in the world, has a fleet of over 260,000 refrigerated containers (referred to as reefers in the industry). In May 2016, the COO of Maersk went public on their decision to retrofit their entire reefer fleet with remote monitoring in a 5-year project. Today, 59% of the claims made against Maersk relate to failures of reefer units so they have a strong economic incentive to solve this problem. Orbcomm subsidiary WAM Technologies (acquired 2015) supplied the telematics application and device management middleware for the final solution. Orbcomm's ReeferConnect solution is now deployed on over 300,000 reefer containers worldwide and are managed via their ReeferConnect SaaS application. The Opportunity in Distribution There are estimated to be 15.5 million trucks in the US alone. Approximately, 2 million of these are semis with about 5.6 million accompanying semi trailers. Many of these trucks and semis form part of commercial fleets and Orbcomm has established a very strong position in refrigerated trucking and a competitive position in dry van fleet management. Orbcomm's reefer customer list reads like a who's who of the refrigerated trucking industry including C.R. England, Werner, Carrier, Celadon, Marten, Prime Inc., Swift, Tyson, Wal-Mart and many others. Food Safety Modernization Act The FSMA is the most sweeping reform of U.S. food safety laws in more than 70 years. It aims to assure the safety of food throughout the supply chain through the introduction of new requirements to food manufacturers, processors, transporters and distributors. There are seven foundational rules within the act with the most relevant rule being the "Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food." The Sanitary Transportation rule applies to the US food chain as follows:  Shippers, receivers, loaders and carriers who transport food within the United States by truck or rail. Shippers in other countries who ship food to the United States by truck, rail, ship or air, and arrange for the transfer of the intact container onto a motor or rail vehicle for transportation within the U.S., if that food will be consumed or distributed in the United States. Companies involved in the transportation of food intended for export are covered by the rule until the shipment reaches a port or U.S. border. The rule does not apply to exporters who ship food through the United States (for example, from Canada to Mexico) by truck or rail if the food does not enter U.S. distribution.  Most shippers have until March of 2017 to comply with these new regulations. Companies with less than 500 employees have at least 1 additional year. For full FSMA compliance dates click here. While reefers are by nature temperature controlled, the new act requires that the shipper must be able to provide a log of the controlled environment upon request from the receiver or an auditor. These records must be kept for a period not exceeding 1 year. Orbcomm's existing ReeferTrak and ReeferConnect SaaS product provides a turnkey solution of hardware and software that is ready to address this market need. The FSMA is driving forward a wave of adoption ahead of the March 2017 deadline and Orbcomm is a major beneficiary. Some recent wins:  Aug 11th, 2016 - Northern Refrigerated to equip all reefers with Orbcomm solution by end of 2016  Aug 8th, 2016 - Carrier Transicold selects Orbcomm to build OEM telematics solution for Carrier.  July 19th, 2016 - Gulik Trucking selects Orbcomm for its refrigerated trucking fleets.   Dry Van Solutions Trucking companies also see benefits in tracking dry van trailers to give a global overview of their equipment and drivers. Orbcomm does not have a dominant position in the much larger dry van market but they do have a competitive turnkey solution (CargoWatch) with robust communications (dual cell/satellite) that integrate with leading trucking software such as TMWSuite and Loadmaster. Some recent wins:  August 25th, 2016 - L.J. Rogers Trucking Selects Orbcomm's Asset Tracking Solution for its Dry Van Trailer Fleet  August 3rd, 2016 - Barnes Transportation Selects Orbcomm's Trailer Tracking Solution for Its Dry Van Fleet  July 19th, 2016 - Gulik Trucking selects Orbcomm for its dry van fleet.   Orbcomm's introduction of an award winning solar powered trailer tracking device in 2015, the GT 1100, has been well received in the industry. The slim, ruggedized and easy to install GT 1100 has eliminated a number of barriers to broad adoption of this type of solution in the Dry Van business. Heavy Equipment Management and Telematics Orbcomm has achieved a dominant position in providing telematic solutions for mobile heavy machinery. Customers with Orbcomm's FleetView SaaS solution can have a near real time view of their entire fleet along with the information that is most important in maximizing the value of that asset. With heavy equipment often used outside the range of a cellular network, it makes a lot of sense to utilize Orbcomm's satellite or satellite/cellular solution in this market. The following marquee customers use an Orbcomm solution: Caterpillar, John Deere, Hitachi, Volvo, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Komatsu, Doosan, Terex. SCADA System Monitoring SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition and is a commonly used acronym in the area of engineering controls. Up until this point, the Orbcomm solutions discussed generally relay data from the device (trailer, container, railcar) back to a central point on the internet. In this category, data is collected and commands are issued to a remote device to control its operation. Examples of this type of need are often found in the utilities industry. A pipeline may span thousands of miles and contain scores of pumping stations with pressure sensors, pumps and valves. These often span remote areas of the country where cellular connections are not an option. Using an Orbcomm solution pumps can be stopped and started, valves opened and closed, etc. In July of 2016, Orbcomm announced that it had won the "SMART Grid Product of the Year Award" for its dual-mode satellite-cellular solution which enables utility companies to manage their Smart Grids by monitoring and controlling reclosers and other network distribution devices in real time. Orbcomm allows you to connect anything that you wish to monitor or control anywhere on the planet in near real time. Utilities are a critical part of a nation's infrastructure so they are early adopters for this kind of technology. Inevitably the use of this type of solution will expand into other industries and find new use cases as the technology becomes cheaper. Automatic Identification System (AIS) AIS is a system that broadcasts a vessel's identification, position and other data. This system is mandated by the International Maritime Organization on all large vessels. While this system was initially designed with collision avoidance in mind, its use has broadened to include security, counter piracy, environmental monitoring, accident investigation (ala Costa Concordia), fishing zone compliance, port logistics and even analysis of shipping patterns as an indicator of economic strength. All Orbcomm satellites are AIS equipped and Orbcomm keeps increasing its AIS revenue each year. In Q2 of 2016, AIS revenue was up 36% Y/Y to $1.7M and will continue to grow due to a recent contract win by their reseller/partner LuxSpace Sarl to provide AIS data to the European Maritime Safety Agency. This 4-year agreement will start to add AIS revenue in Q4 of 2016. Although AIS sounds like an outlier from its core business, it is simply IoT applied to ships. In this case, Orbcomm primarily provides network services and others provide the devices and analytical applications. Why Buy Now? The chart below shows Orbcomm's share price since the company went public in November of 2006. 

 ORBC data by YCharts Compare the chart above to the typical Gartner hype cycle which accompanies many tech IPOs. The "Peak of Inflated Expectations" was in 2007, the "Trough of Disillusionment" around 2009 when investors realize it's not going to change the world overnight. 

 We have traveled along the "Slope of Enlightenment" and entered into the "Plateau of Productivity" which represents the point at which broad mainstream adoption of a new technology/solution is taking place. Orbcomm is a mature company with a strong product line that is ready to capitalise on a business segment that is in a transitional phase from early adopter to broad adoption. The FSMA ensures that food shippers and distributors move to an IoT solution and we will see a market segment (reefers) have full adoption over the next year or so. Orbcomm has a strong moat in its private satellite network that is designed specifically to handle M2M data. This unique asset allows Orbcomm to cover most of the earth and will make it a very strong contender for InterModal shipping allowing containers to be tracked from source to final destination regardless of cellular infrastructure. Orbcomm offers dual mode devices that support both satellite and cellular transmission. Orbcomm is laser focused on their business. They have been in the M2M business from the start and do not have to pivot to take advantage of the opportunity that IoT brings. The onset of IoT plays directly into their existing product portfolio and transforms the appearance of their business from niche satellite solutions player into mainstream IoT solutions provider. Orbcomm demonstrates a strong commitment to the bottom line. The two charts below show the relationships between SG&A and R&D expense in relation to annual revenue. SG&A cost as a fraction of annual revenue has shown a strong down trend whilst R&D has remained relatively flat at around 3.5% flat over the same period. 

 Fundamental Chart data by YCharts Orbcomm is a growing company with a 34% CAGR in revenues and 39% CAGR in EBITDA since 2011. This demonstrates a growing company which is also fiscally responsible.

Earlier this month (Aug 1st, 2016) Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to acquire Fleetmatics (NYSE:FLTX) for $2.4 Billion. Fleetmatics provides fleet management solutions based on cellular communications and had around 737,000 vehicles under subscription at the time of the deal. Click here for the WSJ article on this acquisition. In June 2016, Verizon agreed to acquire privately held Telogis, a specialized telematics company, for an unspecified amount. Click here for the story. If history is any guide, we will see aggregation of IoT players by larger well-established companies with deeper pockets. We used to have thousands of ISPs and telephone companies but those numbers dwindled quickly as they were acquired (usually at a premium) during the 1990s and 2000s. In the new frontier of IoT, we are likely to see the same pattern repeat as the industry behemoths stake their claims on the data landscape of the future. With a market cap around $725M and 1.65M subscribers, Orbcomm's valuation is $440/subscriber. By comparison, Verizon is paying $3,256 per subscriber for Fleetmatics. I'm not drawing a direct comparison between these two companies as Fleetmatics has a much stronger record of profitability and there are obvious synergies, but I do see these two companies as having a great number of similarities. The Future At its heart, Orbcomm is an Internet of Things company with a unique network offering that provides a strong competitive moat. The challenge in front of Orbcomm is one of scale. Orbcomm has recently added ~35,000 subscribers per quarter, excluding acquisitions. I believe the FSMA deadline will drive the new subscriber rate notably higher and we will see this reflected in the quarterly results between 2016 Q3 and Q1 2017. Orbcomm is operating marginally below profitability losing $2.1M in FY 2015 and $4.2M in the first half of FY 2016. I expect a strong increase in subscribers over the next 3 quarters which will put Orbcomm into a position of consistent quarterly profit. I believe the total addressable market for Orbcomm is in the tens of millions and the company is well positioned to capture a very significant share of this market before the end of the decade.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]
Hardware[edit]
Devices[edit]
ORBCOMM offers cellular, satellite and dual-mode hardware devices for M2M tracking, monitoring and control applications, for a variety of industry applications.

GT 1100: a dry van trailer tracking device with solar panel and rechargeable batteries that can be connected to door and cargo sensors. Available with cellular-only, satellite-only or dual cellular-satellite communication options. Chassis tracking option also available.

Modems[edit]
ORBCOMM’s interchangeable OG2 (OG2-M and OG2-GPS) and OG-ISAT (IsatData Pro L-Band) satellite modems feature an identical footprint (smaller than a credit card), connectors, power input, programming environment, communication interface and protocols. ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.

History[edit]
Founding and Low-Earth Orbit Satellite System Development[edit]
The ORBCOMM Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) system was conceived by Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) in the late 1980s. In 1990, Orbital filed the world's first license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the operation of a network of small LEO spacecraft[6] to provide global satellite services of commercial messaging and data communications services via the company's ORBCOMM program.
During the initial stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: regulatory approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 mobile Earth stations (MESs).
ORBCOMM began procuring Gateway Earth Station (GES) locations and contracted with a division of Orbital Sciences, located in Mesa, AZ, to develop and build four sets of GESs and associated spares. Land for the four GESs was procured or leased in Arizona, Washington, New York and Georgia.
After the 1992 WARC approval, ORBCOMM signed contracts with three modem developers and manufacturers: Kyushu Matsushita Electric Company, a division of Panasonic; Elisra Electronic Systems, an Israeli company with expertise in electronic warfare systems; and Torrey Science & Technology, a small San Diego-based company with long ties to Orbital Sciences. Panasonic provided the first ORBCOMM approved MES in March 1995. Elisra followed with the EL2000 in late 1995, and Torrey Science provided the ComCore 200 in April 1996.
During the development of equipment, ORBCOMM also pursued licensing and regulatory approvals in several countries. By 1995, ORBCOMM had obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries with a number of additional countries well into the regulatory process. ORBCOMM was also in initial negotiations with groups in Indonesia, EMEA and Italy for becoming ORBCOMM licensees as well as GES operators in their respective regions.
During the conceptual stages of the LEO satellite communications system, Orbital Sciences purchased a small company in Boulder, Colorado specializing in small satellite design. This company built the first three satellites in the ORBCOMM system: ORBCOMM X, Communications Demonstration Satellite (CDS) 1 and CDS 2. ORBCOMM X was lost after a single orbit. To validate the feasibility of commercially tracking and communicating with a LEO satellite, Orbital built an additional communications payload and flew this payload on an SR-71 in 1992. These tests were successful and work on CDS 1 and 2 continued. CDS 1 and CDS 2 were launched in February and April 1992 respectively. These satellites were used to further validate the design of the network and were showcased in Orbital’s plans to sign up an equity partner for the completion of the ORBCOMM System.
In June 1992, Orbital created an equal partnership called ORBCOMM Global L.P. with Teleglobe Mobile Partners (Teleglobe Mobile), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., for the design and development of the LEO satellite system. Teleglobe Mobile invested $85 million in the project and also provided international service distribution. Orbital agreed to construct and launch satellites for the ORBCOMM system and to construct the satellite control center, the network control center and four U.S. gateway Earth stations.
In April 1995, two satellites (F Plane) were launched, and in the summer the ORBCOMM global mobile data communications network was tested. Teleglobe Mobile invested an additional $75 million in the project that year and joined Orbital as a full joint-venture partner in ORBCOMM. In February 1996, ORBCOMM initiated the world's first commercial service for global mobile data communications provided by LEO satellites. ORBCOMM also raised an additional $170 million.[7] In October 1996, ORBCOMM licensed Malaysian partner Technology Resources Industries Bhd. (TRI) to sell ORBCOMM's global two-way messaging service in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. TRI became the owner of a 15% stake in ORBCOMM, Teleglobe owning 35% and the rest held by Orbital.[8]
In December 1997, ORBCOMM launched 8 satellites (A Plane). In 1998 ORBCOMM launched 2 satellites (G Plane) in February, 8 satellites (B Plane) in August and 8 satellites (C Plane) in September. After a short hiatus, ORBCOMM launched 7 more satellites (D Plane) in December 1999.
With the launch and operation of the C Plane satellites, ORBCOMM became the first commercial provider of global LEO satellite data and messaging communications services. ORBCOMM inaugurated full commercial service with its satellite-based global data communications network on November 30, 1998. In March 1998, the FCC expanded ORBCOMM’s original license from 36 to 48 satellites.[9]
In January 2000, Orbital halted funding of ORBCOMM, and Teleglobe and Orbital signed a new partnership agreement with 67% ownership to Teleglobe and 33% to Orbital.[10] In May 2000, Teleglobe ceased funding ORBCOMM. Like its voice-centric competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September 2000.
New Ownership[edit]
In 2001, a group of private investors purchased ORBCOMM and its assets out of an auction process, and ORBCOMM LLC was organized on April 4, 2001. On April 23, 2001, this group of investors acquired substantially all of the non-cash assets of ORBCOMM Global L.P. and its subsidiaries, which included the in-orbit satellites and supporting U.S. ground infrastructure equipment that the company owns today. At the same time, ORBCOMM LLC also acquired the FCC licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which was not in bankruptcy, in a related transaction. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in November 2006.[2] The company sold 9.23 million shares of common stock.
In September, 2007, ORBCOMM Inc was sued, for its IPO prospectus containing inaccurate statements of material fact. It failed to disclose that demand for the Company’s products was weakening. In 2009, a payment of $2,450,000 was agreed.[11]
In September 2009, ORBCOMM signed a contract with SpaceX to launch ORBCOMM’s next-generation OG2 satellite constellation.[12]
ORBCOMM launched its commercial Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service in 2009.[13] AIS technology is used mainly for collision avoidance but also for maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. AIS launched two additional satellites, VesselSat-1 and VesselSat-2, in January 2011 and October 2012 respectively.
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.
In December 2015, the company launched eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[14]

Satellites[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm (satellite)
The first-generation OG1 satellites each weigh 42 kg (93 lb).[citation needed] Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Communication with subscriber units is done using SDPSK modulation at 4800 bit/s for the downlink and 2400 bit/s for the uplink.
Each satellite has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises the popular TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation.[17] ORBCOMM is the only current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for "Little LEO" systems. Several such systems were planned in the early to mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there is likely to be a satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or simple sensor readings.
A total of 35 satellites were launched by ORBCOMM Global in the mid to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket:[18] one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each.[19][20] These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS.[21][22] Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost.[23] The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites[24] and received $44.5 million in compensation.
OG2[edit]
Main article: Orbcomm-OG2




SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket launched the ORBCOMM OG2 Mission 1 on July 14, 2014.


On 3 September 2009 a deal was announced between ORBCOMM and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to launch 18 second-generation satellites with SpaceX launch vehicles between 2010 and 2014.[25] SpaceX originally planned to use Falcon 1e rocket, but on March 14, 2011 it was announced that SpaceX will use Falcon 9 to carry the first two ORBCOMM next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011.[26] On Oct. 7, 2012, the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype OG2 ORBCOMM communications satellite from Cape Canaveral failed to achieve proper orbit and the company filed a $10 million claim with its insurers.[27] The ORBCOMM satellite was declared a total loss and burned up in the atmosphere upon rentry on October 10, 2012.[28]
On July 14, 2014 ORBCOMM launched six next generation OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. In September 2014, ORBCOMM announced that, after in-orbit testing, the six satellites had been properly spaced within their orbital planes and were processing over 20% of the network’s M2M traffic.[29] In June 2015, the company lost communication with one of the in-orbit OG2 satellites. The company recorded impairment charge of $12.7 million to write-off the net book value of this satellite as of June 30, 2015. The company stated that the loss of this one satellite is not expected to have a material adverse effect on network communications services.[30]
In October 2015, the company announced that SpaceX plans to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites were deployed on December 21, 2015.[31] This dedicated launch marked ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission to complete its next generation satellite constellation.[32]
Compared to its current OG1 satellites, ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts.[33]

 Frequency range   Downlink  137- 138 MHz
                   Uplink    148- 150.05 MHz

Network Services[edit]
ORBCOMM provides satellite data services. As of May 2016, ORBCOMM has more than 1.6 million billable subscriber communicators.[34] ORBCOMM has control centers in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, as well as U.S. ground stations in New York, Georgia, Arizona, Washington and international ground stations in Curaçao, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Plans for additional ground station locations are under way.
The ORBCOMM satellite network is best suited for users who send small amounts of data. To avoid interference, terminals are not permitted to be active more than 1% of the time, and thus they may only execute a 450ms data burst twice every 15 minutes. The latency inherent in ORBCOMM's network design prevents it from supporting certain safety-critical applications.
ORBCOMM’s acquisition of SkyWave Mobile Communications in January 2015 gave the company access to higher bandwidth, lower-latency satellite products and services that leverage IsatData Pro (IDP) technology over Inmarsat's global L-band satellite network.
ORBCOMM's direct competition includes Globalstar's simplex services (which ORBCOMM also resells) and L-band leased capacity services such as those offered by SkyBitz. ORBCOMM's most significant competitor is Iridium Communications, which offers the Iridium SBD service, which features data packet, latency and antenna capabilities similar to that of IDP technology, which is now jointly owned by ORBCOMM and Inmarsat.
ORBCOMM satellite services can be easily integrated with business applications. Customer data can be retrieved or auto-forwarded via SMTP or HTTP/XML feed directly over the Internet or through a dedicated link.[35]
ORBCOMM also partners with seven different cellular providers to offer wireless connectivity, cellular airtime data plans and SIM cards for M2M and IoT applications.[36]
ORBCOMM's other network service business is Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which is a widely deployed system used to track ocean vessels. Six satellites with AIS capability were launched in June 2008, referred to as the Quick Launch satellites. However, all six satellites eventually failed prematurely. When ORBCOMM’s next generation satellites launched on July 14, 2014, each one was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime applications. ORBCOMM combines its satellite AIS data with a variety of terrestrial feeds to track over 150,000 vessels daily for over 100 customers in a variety of government and commercial organizations.[37]

ORBCOMM’s SkyWave IDP 200 Series packaged satellite modems operate over Inmarsat’s IsatData Pro network.
Sensors[edit]
ORBCOMM offers a variety of sensors for M2M applications including a multi-zone cargo sensor, trailer or container door sensor, hook/unhook trailer sensor, fuel level sensor and temperature sensor.
Antennas[edit]
Antennas for ORBCOMM’s IDP service have a small form factor, and are similar to the ones used in the other L-band (1.5-1.6 GHz) satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar). ORBCOMM's spectrum of 137 to 150 MHz is at a much lower frequency, and requires a much larger antenna than other networks. Most antennas are basic "whip" antennas that can be several feet long. Smaller, more compact designs are available but with performance trade-offs.
