What our customers are saying...



              Unlike other gardening suppliers, Breck's has NEVER  sent to me anything that wasn't top quality.  As long as I'm able to "play in the dirt," I'll be buying from Breck's. - Bizrate® survey, Feb ‘17
Source




              Breck's never fails to provide beautiful, healthy plants ready to prosper in my garden.  They have things that I cannot always find locally. - Bizrate® survey, Jan ‘17”
Source




              I love Brecks!   You have dependable plants and flowers that come up as promised, thrive, and blossom, and are great additions to any yard or neighborhood.   Thank you
              - Bizrate® survey, Jan ‘17” Source




             "I have been shopping with Breck's for several years and have never had an issue with either their products or their customer service. I thoroughly enjoy shopping on their website because I always find the unique and hard-to-find plants that are not seen in your typical home improvement store or nursery."
             - Bizrate® survey, Mar ‘17” Source




              I recommend Breck's to family and friends. I give Breck's lily tree bulbs instead of floral arrangements to relatives/friends who have had a death in the family. They are very appreciate of a lovely gift that grows bigger and more beautiful year after year. They look at the lily trees as a beautiful living memorial.  - Bizrate® survey, Nov ‘16” Source
