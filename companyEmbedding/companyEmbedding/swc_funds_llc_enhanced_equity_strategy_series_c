What is 'Passive Investing'
Passive investing is an investment strategy that aims to maximize returns over the long run by keeping the amount of buying and selling to a minimum. The idea is to avoid the fees and the drag on performance that potentially occur from frequent trading. Passive investing is not aimed at making quick gains or at getting rich with one great bet, but rather on building slow, steady wealth over time.

BREAKING DOWN 'Passive Investing'
Also known as a buy-and-hold strategy, passive investing involves buying a security with the intention of owning it for many years. Unlike active traders, passive investors are not attempting to profit from short-term price fluctuations, or otherwise "time the market." The basic assumption that underpins a passive investment strategy is that the market generally posts positive returns given enough time.Passive Investing StrategyTraditionally, passive investors attempt to replicate market performance by constructing well-diversified portfolios of individual stocks, a process that can require extensive research.With the introduction of index funds in the 1970s, achieving returns in line with the market became much easier. In the 1990s, exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track major indices, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), simplified the process even further by allowing investors to trade index funds as though they were stocks.Now that mutual funds and ETFs allow for index investing with relatively little initial research, the most difficult skill for passive investors to master is emotional control. Resisting the urge to sell when the market experiences a downturn requires patience and a strong stomach. When a rapid sell-off triggered circuit breakers that shut down trading in August of 2015, for example, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and many other ETFs tracking the S&P 500 suffered significant losses, as investors panicked at the lack of pricing information and liquidated their holdings.Passive investors must have the presence of mind to weather these storms and trust that the market will correct itself with time.Testing Passive InvestingA highly vocal defendant of passive investing is value investor Warren Buffett. His approach as Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A, BRK-B) exemplifies some of the principles of passive management, including ultra-long investment horizons and infrequent selling. In a sense, however, he is an active investor, since he invests in companies based on particular competitive advantages.While his style of investing cannot be considered fully passive, Buffett is a big proponent of index investing. In 2008, to prove the superiority of passive management, Buffett challenged the hedge fund industry – the quintessential active investors – to a 10-year contest. He put a million dollars in Vanguard's S&P 500 Admiral Fund (the first index fund available to retail investors), while Protégé Partners LLC, the hedge fund that took him up on his challenge, picked five fund of funds.Though the bet is still running as of 2016, Buffett's passive strategy has proven its worth thus far. By the end of 2015, Buffett's passive bet had generated a 66% cumulative return compared to Protégé's 22%.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.






Performance shown may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers. Certain funds may have contractual or voluntary fee waivers that result in a Net Expense Ratio.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Objective

            Seeks long-term capital appreciation

Overview






Fund Overview
High-conviction stock picking with a focus on downside risk mitigation
With the flexibility to increase or decrease equity market exposure, this fund seeks to offer investors access to the long-term benefits of owning stocks while also preserving their capital during extended market declines.
Why Invest In This Fund
Best ideas approach
The fund seeks to provide capital appreciation by constructing a concentrated, high-conviction portfolio of long and short investments. The fund’s ability to take sizeable positions in its best ideas provides the potential for attractive long-term returns, but may also result in volatility in the short-term.
Actively managed equity market exposure
The fund has the flexibility to increase or decrease equity market exposure by adjusting its mix of long, short and cash positions. It will tend to have more equity market exposure when attractive investment opportunities are plentiful and will take steps to reduce equity market exposure when there is an absence of compelling ideas or when risks appear to outweigh reward.
Time-tested investment strategy
The fund integrates bottom-up, fundamental research and top-down macroeconomic views. The strategy has been tested for over a decade through various market environments. PIMCO’s global investment platform and macroeconomic expertise serve to enhance the investment process.
Our Expertise
The fund is managed by John Devir, a highly
skilled long/short equity investor with 23
years of experience in the space, and Ben
Strom, who has 16 years of equity investing
experience. The team’s time-tested approach
benefits from PIMCO’s economic insights,
cyclical and secular views and global
investment platform.

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance shown. For performance current to the most recent month-end, visit www.PIMCO.com/investments or call (888) 87-PIMCO.

This material is authorized for use only when preceded or accompanied by the current PIMCO funds prospectus or summary prospectus, if available and the current fund card.

A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates.Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations;bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations,and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market NAV as of 






Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.


Money Market funds are not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other government agency and although such funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in Money Market funds.

             Performance figures presented reflect the total return performance after fees and reflect changes in share price and reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions on the payable date. All periods longer than one year are annualized.
        

             Total return performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The minimum initial investment for Institutional class shares is $1 million; however, it may be modified for certain financial intermediaries who submit trades on behalf of eligible investors.


For periods prior to 20 April 2012, the fund’s performance reflects the performance when the fund was a partnership, net of actual fees and expenses charged to individual partnership accounts in the aggregate. If the performance had been restated to reflect the applicable fees and expenses of each share class, the performance may have been higher or lower. The fund began operations as a partnership on 1 January 2003 and, on 20 April 2012, was reorganized into a newly-formed fund that was registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Prior to the reorganization, the fund had an investment objective, investment strategies, investment guidelines, and restrictions that were substantially similar to those currently applicable to the fund. However, the fund was not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and was not subject to its requirements or requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which, if applicable, may have adversely affected its performance. The performance of each class of shares will differ as a result of the different levels of fees and expenses applicable to each class of shares.
        

             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.
        

             Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.
        

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures

5The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return for a portfolio and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
6Beta measures the market related volatility of a portfolio. The beta of the market is 1 by definition. A beta greater than 1 indicates that a portfolios market risk is greater than the overall markets, while a beta less than 1 indicates a lower market risk. It is important to note that having a low market risk does not necessarily imply low volatility. A portfolio may have a low beta while experiencing volatility due to factors independent of the market.

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.
        

             References to specific sectors, securities or issuers are for illustrative purposes only. All holdings are subject to change daily. All share classes have the same portfolio but different expenses.

This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:
Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market’s value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Investing in securities of smaller capitalization and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities of larger companies. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets.  Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. REITs are subject to risk, such as poor performance by the manager, adverse changes to tax laws or failure to qualify for tax-free pass-through of income. Entering into short sales includes the potential for loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the portfolio. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its investments in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
