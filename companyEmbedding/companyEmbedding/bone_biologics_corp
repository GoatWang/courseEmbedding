BURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bone Biologics Corporation (OTCQB: BBLG) 
      announced today that it has commenced a private offering of up to 
      $10,000,000 of its securities. The securities will initially only be 
      offered to persons who are either stockholders of the company or who are 
      “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation D under the Securities 
      Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The net offering 
      proceeds will be used for working capital including to fund the further 
      development of Nell-1 which is a recombinant human protein growth factor 
      essential for normal bone development.
    

      The securities will not be registered under the Securities Act or any 
      state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United 
      States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the 
      registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state 
      securities laws.
    

      This press release does not and will not constitute an offer to sell or 
      the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities. This press release 
      is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the 
      Securities Act.
    

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect the 
      Company’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future 
      events. Any statements contained in this press release that are not 
      statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. 
      Words such as “will,” “will be,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “continue,” 
      “future,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
      forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, 
      without limitation, the Company’s expectations with respect to trading 
      in the Company’s common stock on the OTCQB; the next phase of the 
      Company’s development and testing work; the Company’s expectation about 
      moving its technology forward and setting the stage for future growth 
      and enhanced shareholder value; and the future need for regenerative 
      bone solutions. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks 
      and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, many 
      of which are generally outside the control of the Company and are 
      difficult to predict. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include, 
      but are not limited to: future revenues, expenditures, capital or other 
      funding requirements, the adequacy of the Company’s current cash and 
      working capital to fund present and planned operations and financing 
      needs, expansion of and demand for product offerings, and the growth of 
      the Company’s business and operations through acquisitions or otherwise, 
      as well as future economic and other conditions both generally and in 
      the Company’s specific geographic and product markets. Additional 
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements can be found in 
      the most recent current report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2017 and Form 10-Q, filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2017. The Company 
      anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause their 
      views and expectations to change. The Company assumes no obligation, and 
      they specifically disclaim any intention or obligation, to update any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise.

AboutAboutAboutBone Biologics is a publicly traded company based in Boston, MA and is focused on developing and marketing orthobiologic products. Our proprietary platform technology is NELL-1, a recombinant human protein growth factor that is essential for normal bone development. Our lead product is a NELL-1 based bone graft substitute for spine fusion, targeting the rapidly growing orthobiologics market. Our goal is to offer patients superior safety with uncompromising efficacy relative to existing technologies. NELL-1  provides specific targeted regulation over bone regeneration in the presence of targeted osteogenic cells, as both demonstrated in the lab and through the use of animal testing, unlike any other current therapy. It has been shown not to form bone when applied to non-osteogenic cells such as myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell that differentiates to give rise to muscle cells) nor does it induce adipogenesis (the formation of fat that can occur within the bone matrix often exhibited as cysts) that results in weaker bone.
MISSION
Our mission is to utilize the power of NELL-1 to improve clinical outcomes and reduce total health care delivery costs associated with spinal fusion. Bone Biologics is focused on bone repair and regeneration applications and is committed to exploring additional applications of the NELL-1 technology to enhance bone regeneration and repair in areas where the current options provide suboptimal patient outcomes.
LeadershipLeadershipLeadershipThe Bone Biologics leadership team consists of some of the top leaders and innovators of orthobiologics in regenerative medicine. Not only does our leadership provide strategic oversight of the Company, they contribute to the collective advancement of the industry. This leadership is instrumental in fulfilling our mission to improve clinical outcomes and reduce health care delivery costs associated with lumbar spinal fusion.
ProductsProductsProductsWhile Bone Biologics has chosen to focus its initial product development efforts in spinal fusion, we believe that this regenerative medicine technology has potential in the broader fields of bone regeneration and repair including osteoporosis, chondrocytes and applications using mesenchymal stem cells.
 
Investor RelationsInvestor RelationsInvestor RelationsBone Biologics was founded in 2004 by Dr. Chia Soo, MD/Vice-Chair and Professor, UCLA Hospital Dept of Orthopedic Surgery; Dr. Kang Ting DMD, DMSc/Professor, UCLA Dental School; and Dr. Benjamin Wu, DDS, PhD/Chair and Professor, UCLA Dept of Bioengineering.The Company was acquired in 2006 by MTF, the major shareholder and primary funder since the acquisition.
Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, Bone Biologics became a public company in September 2014 and is focused on bone repair and regeneration applications.  The company is committed to exploring additional applications of the NELL-1 technology to enhance bone regeneration and repair in areas where the current options provide suboptimal patient outcomes.

 DevelopmentOur lead product under development is a NELL-1 based bone graft substitute for spine fusion. NELL-1 is a recombinant human protein growth factor that has the same functionality as the endogenous NELL and that which is essential for normal bone development.
Preclinical studies in small and large animals have shown that NELL-1 grows bone at similar rates to recombinant BMP but with a significantly greater safety profile. This is due to the fact NELL-1 forms bone in a target specific fashion and without inducing inflammation, poor bone formation or ectopic bone growth.

Our lead product is a NELL-1 based bone graft substitute for spine fusion, targeting the rapidly growing orthobiologics market. Our goal is to offer patients superior safety with uncompromising efficacy relative to existing technologies. NELL-1  provides specific targeted regulation over bone regeneration in the presence of targeted osteogenic cells, as both demonstrated in the lab and through the use of animal testing, unlike any other current therapy. It has been shown not to form bone when applied to non-osteogenic cells such as myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell that differentiates to give rise to muscle cells) nor does it induce adipogenesis (the formation of fat that can occur within the bone matrix often exhibited as cysts) that results in weaker bone.
MISSION
Our mission is to utilize the power of NELL-1 to improve clinical outcomes and reduce total health care delivery costs associated with spinal fusion. Bone Biologics is focused on bone repair and regeneration applications and is committed to exploring additional applications of the NELL-1 technology to enhance bone regeneration and repair in areas where the current options provide suboptimal patient outcomes.
LeadershipLeadershipLeadershipThe Bone Biologics leadership team consists of some of the top leaders and innovators of orthobiologics in regenerative medicine. Not only does our leadership provide strategic oversight of the Company, they contribute to the collective advancement of the industry. This leadership is instrumental in fulfilling our mission to improve clinical outcomes and reduce health care delivery costs associated with lumbar spinal fusion.

Bone Biologics |  » Development
















































AboutAboutAboutBone Biologics is a publicly traded company based in Boston, MA and is focused on developing and marketing orthobiologic products. Our proprietary platform technology is NELL-1, a recombinant human protein growth factor that is essential for normal bone development. Our lead product is a NELL-1 based bone graft substitute for spine fusion, targeting the rapidly growing orthobiologics market. Our goal is to offer patients superior safety with uncompromising efficacy relative to existing technologies. NELL-1  provides specific targeted regulation over bone regeneration in the presence of targeted osteogenic cells, as both demonstrated in the lab and through the use of animal testing, unlike any other current therapy. It has been shown not to form bone when applied to non-osteogenic cells such as myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell that differentiates to give rise to muscle cells) nor does it induce adipogenesis (the formation of fat that can occur within the bone matrix often exhibited as cysts) that results in weaker bone.
MISSION
Our mission is to utilize the power of NELL-1 to improve clinical outcomes and reduce total health care delivery costs associated with spinal fusion. Bone Biologics is focused on bone repair and regeneration applications and is committed to exploring additional applications of the NELL-1 technology to enhance bone regeneration and repair in areas where the current options provide suboptimal patient outcomes.
LeadershipLeadershipLeadershipThe Bone Biologics leadership team consists of some of the top leaders and innovators of orthobiologics in regenerative medicine. Not only does our leadership provide strategic oversight of the Company, they contribute to the collective advancement of the industry. This leadership is instrumental in fulfilling our mission to improve clinical outcomes and reduce health care delivery costs associated with lumbar spinal fusion.

DevelopmentProducts
 DevelopmentOur lead product under development is a NELL-1 based bone graft substitute for spine fusion. NELL-1 is a recombinant human protein growth factor that has the same functionality as the endogenous NELL and that which is essential for normal bone development.
Preclinical studies in small and large animals have shown that NELL-1 grows bone at similar rates to recombinant BMP but with a significantly greater safety profile. This is due to the fact NELL-1 forms bone in a target specific fashion and without inducing inflammation, poor bone formation or ectopic bone growth. 
Investor RelationsInvestor RelationsInvestor RelationsBone Biologics was founded in 2004 by Dr. Chia Soo, MD/Vice-Chair and Professor, UCLA Hospital Dept of Orthopedic Surgery; Dr. Kang Ting DMD, DMSc/Professor, UCLA Dental School; and Dr. Benjamin Wu, DDS, PhD/Chair and Professor, UCLA Dept of Bioengineering.The Company was acquired in 2006 by MTF, the major shareholder and primary funder since the acquisition.
Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, Bone Biologics became a public company in September 2014 and is focused on bone repair and regeneration applications.  The company is committed to exploring additional applications of the NELL-1 technology to enhance bone regeneration and repair in areas where the current options provide suboptimal patient outcomes.

 Bone Biologics Corp Completes Merger With AFH Acquisition X, Inc 
         










    










 






 











 









Bone Biologics Corp Completes Merger With AFH Acquisition X, Inc

		  Combined company to continue development of leading bone growth regeneration proteins
		

Oct 16, 2014, 16:16 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Bone Biologics, Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


EDISON, N.J., Oct. 16, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Bone Biologics, Corp., ("Bone Biologics" or "The Company") a company developing a proprietary protein for use in bone regenerative medicine using the patented recombinant human protein known as UCB-1 (or Nell-1) for use with patients undergoing spinal fusion, announced today the completion of a reverse merger of privately held Bone Biologics, Inc. and AFH Acquisition X, Inc, a fully-reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company changed its name to Bone Biologics, Corp and anticipates that trading in the Company's common stock will commence on the OTC Bulletin Board following regulatory approvals.
Following the completion of the merger, the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF), the nation's leading tissue bank and majority shareholder, remains as the largest shareholder.  For the last eight years MTF has been an investor in Bone Biologics and will continue its support for the Company's development of Bone Biologics revolutionary bone growth factor. In connection with the merger, Bruce Stroever, the president and CEO of MTF, will serve as Chairman of the Bone Biologics Board and Michael Schuler, MTF's Vice President of New Business Development, will serve as Chief Executive Officer. William Jay Treat, PhD. was appointed the Company's President and Chief Technology Officer.
Nell-1, a bone growth factor has been developed by Bone Biologics, Inc. in partnership with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a more specific alternative to other bone growth factors used in health care today. In large animal studies, Nell-1 exhibited none of the side effects currently associated with other bone growth factors including ectopic bone growth, extraneous bone growth or cyst formation. The next phase will be completing the development and testing work needed to seek regulatory approval for the initial pilot study in human clinical trials.
William Jay Treat said, "We are pleased with the completion of this merger which will now allow the company to move from basic research to preparation for clinical trials.  With our aging population and the growing need for regenerative bone solutions, we are optimistic that Bone Biologics will be an attractive and preferred solution in this dynamic and growing marketplace."
About Bone Biologics 
Bone Biologics was founded by University of California Los Angeles professors in collaboration with an Osaka University professor, and a USC surgeon in 2004. Formed to pursue regenerative medicine for bone, the company currently has as its strategic partners the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, the nation's leading tissue bank and Orthofix a leading global medical device company. Bone Biologics is currently focused on bone regeneration in spinal fusion using its recombinant human protein known as Nell-1. Nell-1 is an osteoinductive orthobiologic; a recombinant protein that provides control over bone regeneration. This patent protected technology has been exclusively licensed to Bone Biologics from UCLA. For more information visit www.bonebiologics.com.
About MTF
The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Edison, NJ, is a national consortium comprised of leading organ procurement organizations, tissue recovery organizations and academic medical institutions. Since its inception in 1987 MTF has received tissue from more than 100,000 donors and distributed more than five million grafts for transplantation. For more information visit www.mtf.org
