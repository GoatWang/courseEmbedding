IP reputation and security services identify, classify, and block malicious files, URLs and IPs, providing comprehensive protection against advanced online threats 
Integrated Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for secure storage of credentials and keys 
SecureJack-capable for secure tunneling of wiredEthernet traffic


Intelligent Power Monitoring (IPM)
										
Enables the AP to continuously monitor and report its actual power consumption and optionally make autonomous decisions to disable certain capabilities based on the amount of power available to the unit
Software configurable to disable capabilities in certain orders. For the 330 Series APs, by default, the USB interface will be the first feature to turn off if the AP power consumption exceeds the available power budget









CHOOSE YOUR OPERATING MODE




The Aruba 330 Series APs offer a choice of operating modes to meet your unique management and deployment requirements.
Controller-managed mode – When managed by Aruba Mobility Controllers, Aruba 330 Series APs offer centralized configuration, data encryption, policy enforcement and network services, as well as distributed and centralized traffic forwarding.
Aruba Instant mode – In Aruba Instant mode, a single AP automatically distributes the network configuration
to other Instant APs in the WLAN. Simply power-up one Instant AP, configure it over the air, and plug in the other APs – the entire process takes about five minutes. If WLAN requirements change, a built-in migration path allows the 330 Series Instant APs to become part of a WLAN that is managed by a Mobility Controller.
Remote AP (RAP) for branch deployments
Air monitor (AM) for wireless IDS, rogue detection and containment
Spectrum analyzer, dedicated or hybrid, for identifying sources of RF interference
Secure enterprise mesh 
For large installations across multiple sites, the Aruba Activate service significantly reduces deployment time by automating device provisioning, firmware upgrades, and inventory management. With Aruba Activate, the Instant APs are factory-shipped to any site and configure themselves when powered up.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Compared to Amazon, Even Netflix Looks Like a Bargain
              
              Amazon.com Inc. has always been the ultimate long-term play for shareholders, given that the company has prioritized expansion at the expense of immediate profit. But even by those standards, it's a pricey bet.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Source: CRN and Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company On Dec. 5th, CRN announced the winners of its 2016 Products of the Year Award. CRN affirmed Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s leadership position in networking with our numerous wins across the Cloud Platform, Enterprise Storage, and Networking technology areas. Aruba’s 330 Series Wave 2 access points claimed CRN’s prestigious Overall Win in Networking. CRN’s annual Products of the Year Awards are given to standout products and services that represent best-in-breed technological innovation and are backed by a supportive channel partner program. This year, for the first time, the winners were determined through a combination of editorial selection and a survey fielded to solution providers to accurately capture real-world satisfaction among partners and their customers. Participants were asked to score their experiences with the finalist products using criteria in the three main categories: TechnologyRevenue and ProfitCustomer DemandThe Aruba 330 Series access points stood out as the Overall Winner of each above category and were awarded Overall Win in Networking. This CRN Award further validates Aruba’s innovation leadership for multi-gigabit technologies and products, where Aruba is leading the way for high performance 802.11ac Wave 2 technology and deployments across verticals.      As the highest performing access points in Aruba’s Wave 2 family, the 330 Series is distinguished with two key advantages:     Very high performance and density wirelessThe 330 Series supports the highest performance with 4x4:4SS MU-MIMO, enabling a highly efficient network with an aggregated data rate up to 2.5Gbps. It is ideal for very high-density environments with over 125 active devices, such as Higher Education, Enterprise, and Financial, etc.Multi-gigabit Ethernet uplink for more capacityThe 330 series is designed with an integrated HPE Smart Rate port (up to 5 Gbps Ethernet), allowing enterprises to leverage their multi-gigabit Ethernet wired network infrastructure to eliminate bottlenecks.  If customers’ switches support HPE Smart Rate, 802.3bz compliance, or if customers plan to update their wired network to HPE Smart Rate soon, then the new Wave 2 330 series will allow them to scale their networks from 1 to 5 Gbps Ethernet, maximizing the overall network capacity and efficiency all while leveraging existing wiring for investment protection.Additionally, compared to other high-end Wave 2 APs in the market, the 330 series is designed with several unique Aruba features that drive better performance and value for customers: Enhanced ClientMatch for the best radio connection and the highest Wave 2 performanceIntegrated BLE for mobile based location services Instant models for flexible and scalable deploymentsFIPS/TAA certified models to provide security features required by federal customersWith the surge of Mobile and IoT, enterprises need a multi-gigabit high-performance WLAN solution to serve the very high-density environment. The Aruba 330 Series has been approved by both industry and customers to be the best Networking product of the year to serve the purpose. For more information about the Aruba 330 Series access points, click here.
