Framing Information










Design for the Lady Chapel of St. Patrick's Cathedral , New York , NY Charles T. Mathews, architect(s). From the American Architect and Building News, November 24, 1900. 17.25 by 13 inches. VG+ condition with light browning along the edges and some light crinkling. Hand-colored Original Plan. This picture is extremely hard to find, as the American Architect and Building News not only had a very small circulation during that time, but very few were actually preserved or colored as this has been. It measures 17.25 by 13 inches. Has a mat border and foam core backing (not attached to the picture). The whole plan measures approximately 20 by 15 inches (with mat border). Finely detailed and beautifully hand-colored. Shrink wrapped.
