Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. We reserve the right to change the use of
proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies that
are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that event are
indicated in an amended prospectus reflecting the same. There is no assurance
that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated.

We believe that we will be able to partially satisfy our anticipated cash
requirements for at least the next 12 months from the net proceeds of this
offering. This estimate is based on certain assumptions, including among others,
achieving a customer base and revenue, continued expansion and conforming actual
costs to estimates. The expenses anticipated to be incurred in expansion of our
marketing capabilities cannot be predicted with certainty. Currently, we do not
have any revenues, and have not yet located financing to implement our business
plan. Initial growth may be very limited and based solely on loans from Mr. Dai
which he has agreed to.

There can be no assurance that unforeseen events will not occur which might
increase anticipated expenses, in which case the net proceeds of this offering
might satisfy our cash requirements for less than the anticipated time period.
The foregoing represents our best estimate of our use of the net proceeds of the
offering based on present planning and business conditions. We reserve the right
to change our use of proceeds as unanticipated changes, such as increased
expenses, rapid growth or intense competition may cause us to redirect our
priorities and reallocate the proceeds for working capital purposes.

If we are not able to raise sufficient proceeds from the sale of the common
stock registered in this Offering, we will not implement our business plan at
all, except maintaining our reporting with the SEC and remain in good standing
with the state of Nevada. We will also need more funds if the costs of marketing
and sales are greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional
financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning
revenues. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or
other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering
or following this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to
obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to
obtain further financing, the successful development of our business, a
successful marketing and promotion program, attracting and, further in the
future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional
equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity
interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.  There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further
funds required for our continued operations. As widely reported, the global and
domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months. If
such conditions and constraints continue, we may not be able to acquire
additional funds either through credit markets or through equity markets. Even
if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find
favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in
place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse
effect on our ability to remain in business.

We may change the use of proceeds because of changes in our business plan.
Investors should understand that we have wide discretion of the use of proceeds.

Gross proceeds                 $25,000   $50,000   $75,000   $100,000
Offering expenses            $   8,000 $   8,000 $   8,000 $    8,000
Net proceeds                 $  17,000 $  42,000 $  67,000 $   92,000
Establishing an office       $   1,000 $   1,500 $   2,000 $    3,000
Website development          $   1,500 $   3,000 $   3,500 $    5,000
Manufacturing and shipping   $   2,500 $  10,000 $  20,000 $   30,000
Sales person salary          $       0 $   9,000 $  18,000 $   27,000
Marketing and advertising    $   2,000 $   7,500 $  11,000 $   13,000
SEC reporting and compliance $  10,000 $  10,000 $  10,000 $   10,000
Miscellaneous expenses       $       0 $   1,000 $   2,500 $    4,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. In the event that the Company
sells 25% or less of the offering, the Company will carry forward with its
business plan and decrease its budgeted expenditures and Mr. Dai has agreed to
loan the Company funds in order to supplement any cash shortage. If necessary,
Jinshan Dai, our president and sole officer and director, has verbally agreed to
loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. As Mr. Dai’s
agreement with the Company is verbal, it is not contractually binding. These
loans will be necessary if the proceeds from this offering are not sufficient to
implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the
OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stock becomes eligible for
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Dai will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering.


There are many barriers of entry in the baby product market and the level of
competition is extremely high. Examples of barriers of entry in this market
include: brand loyalty, aggressive lower pricing tactics, and economies of
scale. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following
which would make our potential customers prefer their baby products to ours.
Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it
difficult for us to enter and compete in this market. Economies of scale make it
easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with
their suppliers of baby products, which would leave us at a disadvantage.

The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of
our products. We will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with
many domestic and international companies offering similar products. Many large
companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential
customers. Many of these companies may have a greater and more established
customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also,
many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for
similar products than us, which may also cause us to lose business. We also
foresee challenges facing new market entrants.  We may be unable to compete
effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Adamas Ventures, Inc. has not yet entered the market and has no market
penetration to date. Once we enter the market, we will be one of many
participants in the business of distributing baby products. Many established and
well-financed entities are currently active in the business of distributing such
products. Nearly all of Adamas Ventures, Inc.'s competitors have significantly
greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities
than Adamas Ventures, Inc. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage
in the market. Therefore, Adamas Ventures, Inc. may not be able to establish
itself within the industry at all.

Our competitive advantage is that we will offer stylish, easy-to-use, high
quality products, while maintaining reasonable prices. We intend on advertising
our products on baby product websites, parenting forums, on online lead
generations sites selling pay-per-lead advertising, internet search engines such
as Google selling cost-per-click advertising and offline media, including
newspaper, outdoor advertising, radio, television and direct mail.


Company Description
We are a development stage company and plan to operate in the distribution of
baby products. We plan to market and distribute an assortment of high quality
baby products in the Central and South American markets. Our products will
include cribs, strollers, clothing, shoes, bottles, bibs, blankets,


 and toys.
Some of our baby products will be designed as part of a series, meaning they
will be designed and made in the same color-scheme and style. We currently have
no baby products. We intend to purchase baby products from manufacturers in
China, ship them to Central and South America and sell the products directly to
retailers. We have not yet identified any manufacturers or shipping companies or
negotiated any arrangements for such services. Our business plan first includes
securing office space, developing a website, and then commencing our marketing
efforts. We plan to complete the aforementioned within a one-year time span. In
order to compete with other distributors of baby products in our target markets,
we intend on hiring personnel with strong marketing backgrounds and who are also
well connected in this industry.

If we are to become a foreign sales agent for one or more domestic Chinese
manufacturers, we will represent their products and continue our business plan
as outlined in this prospectus.

We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 711 S Carson Street, 
Suite 6, Carson City, Nevada, USA, 89701. Our business office is located at 
Room 1403, No. 408 Jie Fang Zhong Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China, 510030.

	ADAMAS VENTURES, INC.






	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	(Unaudited)



	Note 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation



	 


	Adamas Ventures, Inc. (the “Company”) is a for
	profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on January 31, 2014.


	 


	The Company is in the development phase and intends to sell
	baby products. As such, the Company is subject to all risks inherent to the establishment of a start-up business enterprise.


	 


	The Financial Statements and related disclosures as of January
	31, 2015 are audited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
	The January 31, 2015, Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required
	by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”). Certain information and footnote
	disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
	(“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In our opinion, these financial
	statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results
	for the period. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “Adamas Ventures,” “we,” “us,”
	“our” or the “company” are to Adamas Ventures, Inc. and any subsidiaries.



	 




	Note 2: Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures
	about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, (“ASU 2011-11”). ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose both gross information
	and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments
	and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. ASU 2011- 11 is effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. Retrospective disclosure is required
	for all comparative periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
	statements. In October 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements, (“ASU 2012-04”).
	This update includes source literature amendments, guidance clarification, reference corrections and relocated guidance affecting
	a variety of topics in the Codification. The update also includes conforming amendments to the Codification to reflect ASC 820’s
	fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update that will not have transition guidance are effective
	upon issuance. The amendments in this update that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning
	after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet
	(Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (“ASU 2013-01”). This update
	clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
	about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (“ASU 2011-11”). Specifically, ASU 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase
	agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset
	in accordance with specific criteria contained in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement
	or similar agreement. The Company is required to apply the amendments in ASU 2013-01 beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of
	ASU 2013-01 by the Company did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of
	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This update requires companies to provide information regarding the amounts reclassified
	out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, companies are required to present, either on the face
	of the statement where net income is presented or in the accompanying notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated
	other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. ASU 2013-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	on or after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2013-02 was adopted January 1, 2013 and did
	not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)




	 




	Note 6: Capital Stock



	 


	On January 31, 2014 the Company authorized 75,000,000 shares
	of commons stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.


	 


	On January 31, 2014 the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of
	common stock for a purchase price of $0.0001 per share to its founding shareholder. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds
	of $10,000.00.


	 


	As of April 30, 2016 there were no outstanding stock options
	or warrants.



	 




	Note 7: Income Taxes



	 


	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
	for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
	for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences
	resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
	differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
	is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to
	reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely
	than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


	 


	ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
	in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
	attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
	ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
	disclosure, and transition.



	 




	Note 8: Related Party Transactions



	 


	The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.
	The sole officer of the Company provides office space and services free of charge. The Company's sole officer and director is involved
	in other business activities and may in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available.



	 






	Note 9: Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company has evaluated events subsequent through the date
	these financial statements have been issued to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report. Such events
	were evaluated through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this evaluation, it was determined
	that no subsequent events occurred that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.



	 




	Note 10: Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared
	assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.


	 


	For the period ended April 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated
	deficit of $9,830 and working capital of $100,170, which may not be sufficient to sustain operations over the next 12 months. The
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to generate sufficient revenues
	to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock.


	 


	Management plans to fund operations of the Company through
	the proceeds from an offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or private placements of restricted securities or
	the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as profitable operations are achieved. There are
	no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available
	in the future. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability
	or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	        


	This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements.
	These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
	by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes",
	"estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other
	comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
	that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
	from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future
	results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of
	the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	The following discussion and analysis provides information
	which management of 

	ADAMAS VENTURES, INC.

	 (the "Company") believes to be relevant to an assessment and
	understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the
	Company's financial statements and the notes to financial statements, which are included in this report.



	 




	Caution About Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	This management's discussion and analysis or plan of operation
	should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the quarter ended April 30, 2016.


	 


	This section includes a number of forward-looking statements
	that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified
	by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature,
	refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date
	of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
	to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.



	 




	General Overview



	 


	We are a development stage company and plan to operate in the
	distribution of baby products. We plan to market and distribute an assortment of high quality baby products in the Central and
	South American markets. Our products will include cribs, strollers, clothing, shoes, bottles, bibs, blankets, and toys. Some of
	our baby products will be designed as part of a series, meaning they will be designed and made in the same color-scheme and style.
	We intend to purchase baby products from manufacturers in China, ship them to Central and South America and sell the products directly
	to retailers. We are identifying potential manufacturers, shipping companies and negotiating arrangements for such products and
	services. In addition, we are securing office space and developing a website.

	ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	The Company experienced general and administration expenses
	of $nil and $1,250 for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in general and administration
	expenses for this period are attributed to a decrease in professional fees.


	 


	For the three month period ended April 30, 2016, the company
	experienced a net loss of $nil compared to a loss of $1,250 for the three months ended April 30, 2015.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	During the three months period ended April 30, 2016, the Company
	had no working capital needs. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has cash on hand in the amount of $915. Management does not expect
	that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve month period. In the event
	that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient capital
	to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders, but there are no agreements or understandings
	in place currently.


	 


	We believe we will require additional funding to expand our
	business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing
	from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. In the event
	we are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director.

	Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,

	required disclosure.


	 


	As of April 30, 2016, the end of our quarter covered by this report,
	we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer
	and our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
	disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer and our principal financial
	officer and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of
	the period covered by this quarterly report.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
	reporting that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
	our internal controls over financial reporting.

‡ Offer applies only to single-receipt qualifying purchases. No interest will be charged on the promo purchase if you pay the promo purchase amount in full within 6 Months. If you do not, interest will be charged on the promo purchase from the purchase date.  Depending on purchase amount, promotion length and payment allocation, the required minimum monthly payments may or may not pay off purchase by end of promotional period. Regular account terms apply to non-promotional purchases and, after promotion ends, to promotional balance.  For new accounts: Purchase APR is 29.99%; Minimum Interest Charge is $2. Existing cardholders should see their credit card agreement for their applicable terms. Subject to credit approval.



§ Monthly payment shown is equal to the purchase price (excluding taxes and delivery) divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded to the next highest whole dollar, and only applies to the selected financing option shown. If you make your payments by the due date each month, the monthly payment shown should allow you to pay off this purchase within the promo period if this balance is the only balance on your account during the promo period. If you have other balances on your account, this monthly payment will be added to the minimum payment applicable to those balances.
