Home  About PD









About Predictive Discovery Limited (ASX:PDI)
Predictive Discovery Limited (PDI) was established in late 2007 to explore for gold and uranium.  The company is focusing principally on exploration for gold in West Africa with one additional project for gold in Australia.  The company has a distinctive technological capability, known as Predictore®, that sets it apart from its peers.Burkina Faso is the principal focus of PDI’s exploration activities.  It is an emerging West African country that contains large areas of the prospective, relatively unexplored, Birimian age greenstone belts.  A series of large gold discoveries have been made in Burkina Faso over the past decade, seven of which are now in production. The country is safe to operate in and has a mining law that encourages exploration and development.  PDI has been working there since early 2008 and has established a local office with qualified field staff. With good local contacts, it is in a strong position to acquire more ground. PDI has assembled a ground position in Burkina Faso totalling 1,533 square kilometres.  It was selected through a country wide analytical assessment over the past three years that prioritised favourable mineralised geological structures and greenstone belts.  This led us to our Bonsiega project in the Fada N’Gourma greenstone belt situated in the east of the country and along strike from the Samira Hill gold mine, just inside Niger to the north-east. The Bangaba project, which was acquired in February 2011, and in which the company has since obtained numerous high grade gold intercepts, was also identified in this way.
PDI is targeting multi-million ounce ore deposits in Burkina Faso. Since the Company began operations in 2010, PDI geologists have carried out a series of large reverse circulation, diamond and power auger drilling campaigns, as well as geological mapping and extensive airborne geophysical surveys.  Numerous ore grade and width gold intercepts have been obtained in ten prospects.
In mid-2013, PDI acquired two new projects in Cote D'Ivoire - Kokumbo and Ferkessedougou. Reconnaisance exploration programs are planned for the 2013-14 field season.In Australia, PDI is targeting a major new gold discovery under cover west of Ballarat. Activities in the past year have been very low key as the Company focuses its expenditure on its West African projects.

Home  Projects  Cote D'Ivoire Projects









Cote d'Ivoire Projects
PDI holds four highly prospective exploration permits in Cote D’Ivoire: Kokumbo, Ferkessedougou, Boundiali and Kounahiri, covering a total area of 1,533km2 (Figure 1). These permits were selected by a country-wide analysis of geophysical and geological data using the same Predictore® methods which were used to select the Company’s ground in Burkina Faso.
Joint Venture with Toro Gold Limited
PDI signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) with Toro Gold Limited (Toro) on the Company's entire Cote D'Ivoire ground holding on 22nd September 2014. Subject to successful completion of legal due diligence by Toro, terms of the agreement include:

Toro will spend US$1 million to earn 51% in PDI's Cote D'Ivoire subsidiary, Predictive Discovery Cote D'Ivoire SARL (Predictive CI), which holds all of PDI's Cote D'Ivoire ground (Figure 6);


Toro will pay US$200,000 in cash to PDI on completion of legal due diligence and execution of a full Joint Venture document within 90 days of signature of the HOA;


Assuming that Toro earns the initial 51%, Toro will make further cash payments of up to US$100,000 in the following 24 months;


After Toro has earned 51%, PDI may choose to contribute or dilute in stages. If PDI chooses to dilute, Toro can earn 65% by spending US$2.5 million and up to 90% by sole funding through to a full feasibility study;


Toro's minimum commitment is US$400,000 expenditure within 12 months; and


An exploration program covering the first US$1 million of expenditure will be agreed between PDI and Toro, including planned drilling in 2015.

Toro is a private gold exploration and development company focused in Africa. It is led by a team with a successful track record of discovery, development, operation and corporate transactions. Toro is well funded, and has strong institutional shareholder support, including the African Lion 3 Fund, Resource Capital Funds, Macquarie Bank and Sprott.  Toro's flagship project is the Mako deposit in Senegal with a published JORC 2012-compliant Resource Estimate of 1.4 million ounces at 1.75g/t Au. Mako is currently the subject of a Definitive Feasibility Study. This joint venture is Toro's first investment into Cote D'Ivoire.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.

Home  Projects  Burkina Faso









Burkina Faso Projects
The Burkina Faso projects are all located within the Birimian gold belts in West Africa. As Figure 1 shows, these belts contain numerous gold discoveries, a number of which are in production. Many areas of active artisanal mining remain only lightly explored. As a result, further exploration driven by continuing investor and mining company interest is likely to produce more gold discoveries in the years to come.

Figure 1: Major West African gold deposits within the Birimian gold belt (green indicates areas of volcanics and sediments and pink indicates areas of granite). Burkina Faso is outlined in yellow. PDI project locations are denoted by the star symbols.
Burkina Faso is a landlocked country, bounded to the south by Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire, Togo and Benin, to the west by Mali and to the east by Niger (Figure 1). Gold mining in the past was confined to artisanal mining and one substantial mining operation at Poura in the west of the country which closed in 1999. In the past nine years, however, there has been a strong resurgence in exploration and mine development, stimulated especially by the release of new mining regulations in 2003. The Taparko, Mana, Kalsaka, Inata, Essakane, Bissa and Youga gold mines are now in production. Of these, the largest known deposits are at Mana and Essakane. In addition, exploration results announced by Orbis Gold Limited (Natougou and Nabanga), Ampella Mining Limited (Batie West), Gryphon Minerals Ltd (Banfora), Roxgold Resources (Yaramoko), Golden Rim Resources (Netiana), Volta Resources Inc. (Kiaka), True Gold Mining (Karma) and Orezone Gold Corporation (Bombore) suggest that more gold mines will be developed in future years. Some of these prospects have gold grades well above the West African average, notably Yaramoko, Nabanga, Natougou and Netiana, indicating that Burkina Faso has significant potential for high grade, low cost ounces which supports PDI’s own sharp focus on high grade gold targets.
In common with other West African countries, the Government has the right to take a free carried interest of 10% in any ore deposit that is brought into production. Gold mining royalties range from 3% to 5% depending on the gold price. The rate of corporate tax for mining companies is 17.5%. Discussions between the Government and the mining industry about possible changes to the Mining Act and the taxation code have been ongoing for the past year but no decisions have yet been made.

Figure 2: Locations of PDI exploration permits in Burkina Faso. Yellow dots denote prospects with drill results reported in 2012-13.
In Burkina Faso, PD holds rights to explore 12 granted exploration permits covering a total area of 1,533 square kilometres (Figure 2).  A thirteenth permit, Bassieri, covering an additional 74km2 is close to grant. The bulk of the ground held lies within nine permits which are known collectively as the Bonsiega Project (Figure 2). The Bonsiega Project covers 100km of greenstone belt along strike from the Samira Hill Gold Mine in Niger and includes many active artisanal gold mining sites. A second important focus for the Company is the Bangaba permit in the Sebba Belt nearby to the north (Figure 2).
The Company’s objective in Burkina Faso is to discover a large resource/reserve inventory with an average grade exceeding 2g/t Au capable of supporting a major gold mining operation.
