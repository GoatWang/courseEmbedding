BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Quality Care Properties, Inc. (NYSE:    QCP) today reminded investors that on November 28, 2016, HCP, Inc. ("HCP"), the former parent company of QCP, issued a press release providing important tax information for investors of QCP that owned shares of HCP as of October 24, 2016, the record date (the "Record Date") for the spin-off of QCP from HCP on October 31, 2016 (the "Spin-Off"). HCP common stockholders received one share of QCP common stock for every five shares of HCP common stock they held as of the Record Date (the "Distributed Shares") and cash in lieu of fractional shares of QCP. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, HCP stated that it intends to report that the fair market value of the QCP common stock distributed per each share of HCP common stock outstanding on the Record Date was approximately $6.17, or $30.85 for each share of QCP common stock. Accordingly, every HCP common stockholder who received a Distributed Share will have a tax cost basis of $30.85 per Distributed Share. QCP investors should consult HCP's website (www.hcpi.com) for further information.








Also on December 21, 2016, QCP announced that due to the lack of real estate investment trust ("REIT") taxable income following the Spin-Off and the ongoing financial difficulties experienced by its primary tenant, HCR Manor Care, Inc., it will not be declaring a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2016.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
