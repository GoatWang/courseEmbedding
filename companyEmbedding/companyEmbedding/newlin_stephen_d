DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Univar Inc. (NYSE:    UNVR) ("Univar"), a global chemical distributor and provider of value-added services, announced today the appointment of Stephen D. Newlin as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective May 31, 2016. Mr. Newlin has served on the Univar Board of Directors since 2014.










 







							 		Univar Names Chemical Industry Executive and Board Member Stephen D. Newlin President and CEO, effective May 31, 2016.
							  



 

 
 



Mr. Newlin, 63, is a deeply accomplished executive with more than 35 years of world-class experience in the chemical industry. He previously served as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PolyOne Corporation from 2006 - 2014, where he led the company's transformation into a leading global polymer producer with $4 billion of annual revenues. Mr. Newlin currently serves as Executive Chairman of the Board for PolyOne, a role from which he will be retiring as of May 12, 2016. From 2003 to 2006, Mr. Newlin was President, Industrial Sector at Ecolab, Inc. He previously spent 24 years at Nalco Chemical Company in positions of increasing responsibility. He served as President and Director of Nalco from 1998 to 2001, and was President, Chief Operating Officer, and Vice Chairman from 2000 to 2001. Mr. Newlin currently serves on the boards of directors of The Chemours Company and Oshkosh Corporation.



"I am honored to have been selected to lead Univar," said Newlin. "I am excited to continue working with this talented and dedicated team in a new leadership capacity to accelerate profitable growth, further develop our leadership team, and deliver service excellence for our customers, all the while building shareholder value." 
Mr. Newlin succeeds Erik Fyrwald, who announced on May 2, 2016, his voluntary resignation as President and Chief Executive Officer, and from the Board of Directors of Univar, effective May 31, 2016, to become Chief Executive Officer of another company. Mr. Newlin will be based at Univar's corporate headquarters in Downers Grove. 
"This was a deeply personal decision because of my sincere fondness for Univar and all of its dedicated and capable employees," said Fyrwald. "As I look back over the past 4 years as CEO, I am proud of the significant progress we have made together in positioning Univar to grow by strengthening our commercial capabilities, supply chain operations, and services businesses. But, I also make this decision knowing that Univar is in the best of hands with Steve Newlin. During his remarkable career, Steve has repeatedly demonstrated that he has the leadership and experience required to drive greatness within companies, as he has done with PolyOne, and will make a seamless transition into his new leadership role."
Univar Chairman William S. Stavropoulos added, "Steve is uniquely qualified to lead Univar and has built an impressive record of accomplishment and growth throughout his 37-year career in the chemical and distribution industry. He has also been an effective and highly constructive member of the Board of Directors, demonstrating strategic vision, deep industry insights, and the ability to bring people together. We are grateful to Erik for his strong leadership and many accomplishments while serving as Univar's CEO and wish him equal success with his new endeavour. At the same time, the Board is very pleased that under Steve's leadership we will continue to move our company forward to the next level of profitable growth."

PolyOne Names Stephen D. Newlin Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer



Published on 2006-02-15. Author :
SpecialChem













CLEVELAND -- PolyOne Corporation (NYSE: POL), a leading
global polymer compounding and North American distribution company, announced
the appointment of Stephen D. Newlin, president of the Industrial Sector
of Ecolab Inc., as chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective
February 21.
Newlin, 53, brings to PolyOne an extraordinarily strong background in
sales and marketing, with a particular focus on supporting the customer
through the delivery of value-added products and services. He also has
significant experience in international operations, merger and acquisition,
integration and change management.
"In Steve Newlin, we have found a leader with a broad, diverse skill
set and the in-depth knowledge of global markets that comes only from
having lived and worked abroad," said Farah M. Walters, chair of
the Compensation and Governance Committee of PolyOne's Board of Directors.
"Just as importantly, Steve believes in our mission and has confidence
in PolyOne's potential to be a strong, healthy, growing Company that serves
and rewards its stakeholders and outperforms its peers."
Newlin has been with Ecolab, a specialty chemical company, since 2003.
A leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitation,
pest elimination, maintenance and repair products and services, the St.
Paul, Minnesota-based company serves the hospitality, food service, health
care and industrial markets. Earlier, Newlin spent more than two decades
with Nalco Chemical Company (now Nalco Holding Company), where he ultimately
served as president, chief operating officer and a director.
"Throughout his distinguished career, Steve Newlin has proved that
he knows how to motivate people to embrace and accelerate change and to
deliver value and results," said PolyOne Chairman William F. Patient,
who has been serving as CEO. "Steve espouses a customer-centric approach
that will resonate among PolyOne's stakeholders. With his extensive commercial
and management background, he understands the critical importance of innovation,
superior service, product quality and consistency, and reliable delivery."
Newlin becomes the third CEO since PolyOne's formation in 2000. "I
am honored by the board's confidence in me and eager to get to work,"
he said. "The foundation is in place for a Company capable of sustained,
profitable growth fueled by strategic sales and marketing, innovation
and enhanced global positioning. I look forward to meeting with my new
colleagues and hearing their ideas on how, together, we can make this
Company great."
With Newlin's arrival, Patient will move into the newly created position
of lead director of the board. Patient is a former chairman and CEO of
The Geon Company, a predecessor of PolyOne. As non-executive chairman
of PolyOne since November 2003, he agreed at the board's request to take
on the duties of CEO when Thomas A. Waltermire stepped down as president,
chief executive officer and a director on October 7, 2005.
"Bill has been an excellent steward of PolyOne throughout this transitional
period," said Walters. "With diligence and purpose, he took
charge and did an exceptional job. The entire organization owes him its
heartfelt thanks. We have benefited from the presence of one proven leader,
and now we move forward with another."
About Stephen D. Newlin
At Ecolab - a $4.5 billion company with 21,000 employees and operations
in approximately 170 countries - Newlin led the Industrial Sector, which
comprises seven divisions that provide cleaning and sanitation solutions
for the food and beverage, health care, textiles, vehicle care and water
care markets.
Prior to joining Ecolab, Newlin spent 23 years with Nalco Chemical, a
$3 billion global specialty chemical company with 10,000 employees. Starting
as a sales representative in 1980, he progressed rapidly through a series
of sales management and general management positions and was named president
of Nalco Pacific in 1992. In this role, he led all manufacturing, functional
and commercial activities in Asia Pacific.
In 1994, Newlin embarked on a three-year assignment as president of Nalco
Europe, with responsibility for all aspects of the company's businesses
throughout Europe and the Middle East, including all commercial functions,
research and development, manufacturing, finance and support services.
In this position, he led a successful change initiative to reorganize
the business around markets rather than geography. He also instilled a
value- added philosophy toward customers.
Returning to the United States, Newlin was named president of Nalco's
Specialty Division, then was elected president and a director of the company
in 1998. He added the responsibilities of chief operating officer and
vice chairman in 2000. That same year, he became chairman of Nalco Exxon
Energy Chemicals, a joint venture of Nalco and Exxon Energy Chemicals.
He elected to leave Nalco in 2001.
Before joining Nalco, Newlin served a brief stint as a commissioned officer
in the U.S. Public Health Service, where he led the design, contracting
and construction of water and wastewater systems. He holds a bachelor
of science degree in civil engineering from the South Dakota School of
Mines. In 1990, he completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard
Business School.
Newlin is a member of the Board of Directors of Black Hills Corporation
(NYSE: BKH), a diversified energy company based in Rapid City, South Dakota.
He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the South Dakota School of
Mines Foundation.
Newlin currently resides with his family in Medina, Minnesota. He and
his wife, Terry, have two sons: Scott, 14, and Grant, 17.
About PolyOne
PolyOne Corporation, with 2005 annual revenues of approximately
$2.5 billion, is a leading global compounding and North American distribution
company with operations in thermoplastic compounds, specialty polymer
formulations, color and additive systems, and thermoplastic resin distribution.
Headquartered in northeast Ohio, PolyOne has employees at manufacturing
sites in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and joint ventures
in North America and South America. 
Forward-looking Statements
In this press release, statements that are not historical information
are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We cannot guarantee that any
forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have
been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Forward-looking statements
give current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees
of future performance. They are based on management's expectations that
involve a number of business risks and uncertainties, any of which could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied
by the forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by
the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts
but allude to future operating or financial performance.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and
inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual
results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.
Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.
Some specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
include, but are not limited to:
a failure of PolyOne to achieve its potential to be a strong, healthy,
growing Company that serves and rewards its stakeholders and
outperforms its peers; changes in U.S., regional or world polymer consumption growth rates
affecting PolyOne's markets; a failure of the new CEO to motivate people to embrace and accelerate
change and to deliver value; a failure of PolyOne to create sustained, profitable growth fueled by
strategic sales and marketing, innovation and enhanced global
positioning; and other factors affecting our business beyond our control, including,
without limitation, changes in the general economy, the cost of raw
materials, interest rates and the rate of inflation.
You are advised to consult our reports on Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K provided
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional risk factors
that could affect PolyOne's performance. You should understand that it
is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently,
you should not consider any list to be a complete set of all potential
risks or uncertainties.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
