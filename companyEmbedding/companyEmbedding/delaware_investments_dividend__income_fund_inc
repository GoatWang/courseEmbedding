	Delaware Investments® Colorado Municipal Income Fund, Inc.
  




Overview
Portfolio
Management
Supplemental data



Objective 
The Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from both regular federal income tax and Colorado state income tax, consistent with the preservation of capital. 
Strategy 
The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing substantially all (in excess of 80%) of its net assets in tax-exempt Colorado municipal obligations un-insured, investment grade. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in non-investment grade municipal securities with an investment rating of Ba/BB or lower, or that are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the Fund's investment advisor. Investment in municipal bonds of below investment grade quality involves special risks as compared with investment in higher grade municipal bonds. These risks include greater sensitivity to general economic downturns. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly known as "junk bonds." These securities are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and repay principal owed. Up to 20% of the securities owned by the Fund may generate interest that is subject to federal alternative minimum tax ("AMT"). The Fund intends to emphasize investments in Colorado municipal obligations with long-term maturities in order to maintain an average portfolio maturity of 20 to 30 years. The average portfolio maturity, however, may be shortened from time to time depending on market conditions. As a result, the Fund's portfolio at any given time may include both long- and intermediate-term Colorado municipal obligations.

1The ratio of expenses to average net assets applicable to common shareholders excluding interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 0.90%, 1.01%, 0.92%, 0.94%, and 0.89% respectively.


2The ratio of net investment income excluding interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 5.03%, 5.11%, 5.16%, 5.45%, and 5.27%, respectively.





Investing in closed-end investment companies involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
The Fund may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity, at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying. A portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.


High yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risk than investment grade bonds.


Substantially all dividend income derived from tax-free funds is exempt from federal income tax. Some income may be subject to state or local taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) that applies to certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.


Funds that invest primarily in one state may be more susceptible to the economic, regulatory, and other factors of that state than funds that invest more broadly.

The Fund may experience portfolio turnover that approaches or exceeds 100%, which could result in higher transaction costs and tax liability.
The Fund’s use of leverage may expose common shareholders to additional volatility, and cause the Fund to incur certain costs. In the event that the Fund is unable to meet certain criteria (including, but not limited to, maintaining certain ratings with Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investor Service, funding dividend payments or funding redemptions), the Fund will pay additional fees with respect to the leverage.

Duration number will change as market conditions change. Therefore, duration should not be solely relied upon to indicate a municipal bond fund’s potential volatility.
Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After being issued during a one-time-only public offering, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a securities exchange. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities by total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than your original investment.
The Fund may make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a Fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

NAV, market price, and premium or discount will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment.   

 Market Price is the price an investor would pay for shares of a fund on the secondary market. Market price shown is the market closing price as of the previous business day. 
 Net asset value (NAV) is the total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
 Premium/Discount is the amount by which the market price trades above or below the NAV.

Overview

Objective


The primary investment objective of the Fund is to seek high current income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective.


Strategy


The Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities. Up to 35% of the Fund's total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.

Investing in closed-end investment companies involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Diversification may not protect against market risk.


Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
The Fund may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity, at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying. A portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.


High yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risk than investment grade bonds.


Narrowly focused investments may exhibit higher volatility than investments in multiple industry sectors.

REIT investments are subject to many of the risks associated with direct real estate ownership, including changes in economic conditions, credit risk, and interest rate fluctuations. 

The Funds may invest in derivatives, which may involve additional expenses and are subject to risk, including the risk that an underlying security or securities index moves in the opposite direction from what the portfolio manager anticipated. A derivatives transaction depends upon the counterparties’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations.

The Fund may experience portfolio turnover that approaches or exceeds 100%, which could result in higher transaction costs and tax liability.
Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After being issued during a one-time-only public offering, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a securities exchange. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities by total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than your original investment.
The Fund may make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a Fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

NAV, market price, and premium or discount will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment.   

 Market Price is the price an investor would pay for shares of a fund on the secondary market. Market price shown is the market closing price as of the previous business day. 
 Net asset value (NAV) is the total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
 Premium/Discount is the amount by which the market price trades above or below the NAV. 

 All third-party marks cited are the property of their respective owners.

Delaware Investments® Dividend And Income Fund, Inc. Announces Dividends






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 5:19 PM EDT













 




























































  Today, Delaware Investments Dividend and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a New York Stock Exchange-listed closed-end fund trading under the symbol "DDF," declares a monthly dividend of $0.0400 per share. This dividend is payable July 28, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 14, 2017. The ex-dividend date will be July 12, 2017.  The Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities, which may include up to 25% in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate industry operating companies. Up to 35% of the Fund's total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.  The Fund has implemented a managed distribution policy. Under the policy, the Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net investment income and short-term capital gains. The balance of the distribution will then come from long-term capital gains to the extent permitted, and if necessary, a return of capital. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund's capital loss carryovers from prior years. For federal income tax purposes, the effect of such capital loss carryovers is to convert (to the extent of such current year gains) what would otherwise be nontaxable returns of capital into distributions taxable as ordinary income. The use of such capital loss carryovers in this circumstance will produce no tax benefit for shareholders, and the capital loss carryovers available to offset future capital gains of the Fund will be reduced. Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, this tax effect attributable to the Fund's capital loss carryovers (the conversion of nontaxable returns of capital into distributions taxable as ordinary income) will no longer apply to net capital losses of the Fund arising in Fund tax years beginning after Nov. 30, 2011. The actual determination of the source of the Fund's distributions can be made only at year end. Shareholders should receive written notification regarding the actual components and tax treatments of all Fund distributions for the calendar year 2017 in early 2018.

Announces Share Repurchase ProgramBusiness WireJuly 24, 2017ReblogShareTweetSharePHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Delaware Investments Dividend and Income Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”), a New York Stock Exchange–listed closed-end fund trading under the symbol “DDF,” announced that its Board has approved an open-market share repurchase program to authorize the Fund to purchase, from time to time, up to 10% of the Fund’s common shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management, in an effort to reduce the Fund’s market price discount to net asset value.Subject to the 10% limitation, the timing and amount of repurchases would be in the discretion of the Fund’s portfolio managers. In exercising their discretion consistent with their portfolio management responsibilities, the portfolio managers will take into account various other factors, including, but not limited to, the level of the discount, the Fund’s performance, portfolio holdings, dividend history, market conditions, cash on hand, the availability of other attractive investments, and whether the sale of certain portfolio securities would be undesirable because of liquidity concerns or because the sale might subject the Fund to adverse tax consequences. Any repurchases would be made on a national securities exchange at the prevailing market price, subject to exchange requirements, federal securities laws and rules that restrict repurchases, and the terms of any outstanding leverage or borrowing of the Fund.If and when the Fund’s 10% threshold is reached, no further repurchases could be completed unless authorized by the Board. Until the 10% threshold is reached, Fund management will have the flexibility to rapidly commence share repurchases if and when it is determined to be appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances. The share repurchase program is intended to benefit shareholders by enabling the Fund to repurchase shares at a discount to net asset value, thereby increasing the proportionate interest of each remaining shareholder in the Fund.The Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities, which may include up to 25% in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate industry operating companies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
