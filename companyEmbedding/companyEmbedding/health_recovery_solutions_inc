The Northwell Health Home Care Network Enters into Agreement with Health Recovery Solutions
Feb 6 17
The Northwell Health Home Care Network announced an agreement with Health Recovery Solutions (HRS) that provides home-care patients with Bluetooth-enabled tablets that can transmit their vital signs to their clinicians, as well as videoconferencing capabilities. Through HRS' advanced telemonitoring technology, Northwell home care patients now have wireless, Bluetooth-enabled tablets that include a moveable video camera, blood-pressure and digital weight monitors, a pulse oximeter and a stethoscope. The device transmits vital sign and symptom information to patients' physicians, nurses and family members in real time, and also triggers alerts for patients at high risk of a medical emergency. Unlike the Northwell Home Care Network's previous telemonitoring technology, which was integrated into a desktop computer, the portability of the new system provides clinicians with remote access to patients, enabling them to communicate 24/7, including on their mobile devices.

Hackensack

Hackensack Alliance Care Organization

Challenge: Reduce 30-day Hospital readmissions and increase patient engagement
Solution: Give patients the tools to manage their own care through HRS' software 
Results: A randomized clinical study was performed by Hackensack Hospital and Holy Name Medical Center to evaluate the effectiveness of using HRS’ solution to increase patient engagement and lower 30-day hospital readmissions. The results of the study indicated that there was a statistically significant drop in readmissions for the group of patients using HRS’ tablet compared with those who did not, 8% versus 28%, respectively.
											













HomeHealth Visiting Nurses of Southern Maine

Challenge: Support telehealth nurses in reducing readmissions for fragile and at-risk patients
Solution: Use HRS' software and reminders provided for patients to take their daily vitals
Results: HHVN launched the new generation of technology from Health Recovery Solutions (HRS) in 2015 to
												support the care of their most fragile and at-risk patients. Of the 474 patients placed on the HRS Patient Connect®
												Platform from April 2015 to April 2016, there was a 4.2% 30-day readmission rate, which is a 75% reduction in
												overall 30-day hospital readmissions for chronic disease patients. The state average in Maine is 16.6%.
											













FirstHealth of The Carolinas

Challenge: Reduce 30-day hospital readmissions for CHF, Diabetes and COPD patients
Solution: Implement the HRS remote patient-monitoring platform
Results: The HRS telehealth remote patient-monitoring platform has allowed FirstHealth to reduce the number
												of costly home nursing visits while improving the quality of care. First Health' home visits per 60 days in 2015
												was 4.8 visits, 40% lower than the national average. Of the 175 heart failure patients monitored to date for
												Community Care, there has been a 40% reduction in the number of hospitalizations as compared to the six months
												prior to enrollment in the Center for Telehealth. That represents over 80 avoided hospitalizations and a $560,000
												savings to the State's Medicaid Program.
											













McAuley Seton Home Care

Challenge: Reduce 30-day hospital readmissions and continue to provide quality care
Solution: Use HRS' innovative software to increase patient compliance
Results: While New York's average for 30-day home care hospital readmissions is 16.4%, Catholic Health
												and HRS were able to achieve a 6% readmission rate for its CHF patients last quarter. The low 6% 30-day readmission
												rate is mostly contributed to extremely high daily compliance rates. For example, patients using HRS's software
												and hardware engagement kits had a 90% daily adherence rate for recording their blood pressure, weight, and oxygen
												levels. They answered the daily symptom questionnaire 82% of the time.
											













Cornerstone VNA

Challenge: Reduce 30-day readmissions for CHF patients
Solution: Implement the HRS disease-specific software
Results: HRS's disease-specific software is designed to engage patients with education videos, teach-back
												quizzes, care plans and surveys, and allows for video conferencing with nurses and family members. The software
												is loaded on tablets and provides all the standard telehealth monitoring while integrated with wireless Bluetooth
												devices. With a focus on engagement and education, Cornerstone VNA now has a 4.8% 30-day readmission rate for
												its CHF patients using HRS's software.
											















What Our Clients are Saying











“Since launching with HRS we've had our best performance in terms of CHF readmission numbers. For the last two
													months we've had zero thirty day readmissions and our overall readmission rate stands at 4.4%. There's a secret
													sauce here, engaging patients in their own self care management, providing them with tools for better outcomes.”

- Anne Norris MD, CMO of Penn Care at Home



“This is not your traditional telehealth. We are transforming our model of care delivery and using technology
													in different ways to engage and empower patients and family members.”

- Andrea Lazarek-LaQuay, Chief Clinical Officer at VNA NY



“Reducing nursing visits per episode of care not only reduces the overall cost of care, but it also allows us
													to provide care to more patients with the same amount of staff. The return on investment is positive.”

- Patty Upham, First Health



“What we are doing is true population health. By addressing health literacy and engaging our patients in self-care,
													we have gone far beyond the realm of telehealth.”

- Donna DeBlois, HHVN President

HRS Clinically Proven





Hackensack
MaineHealth
FirstHealth
Catholic Health
Cornerstone











Hackensack Alliance Care Organization

Challenge: Reduce 30-day Hospital readmissions and increase patient engagement
Solution: Give patients the tools to manage their own care through HRS' software 
Results: A randomized clinical study was performed by Hackensack Hospital and Holy Name Medical Center to evaluate the effectiveness of using HRS’ solution to increase patient engagement and lower 30-day hospital readmissions. The results of the study indicated that there was a statistically significant drop in readmissions for the group of patients using HRS’ tablet compared with those who did not, 8% versus 28%, respectively.
											













HomeHealth Visiting Nurses of Southern Maine

Challenge: Support telehealth nurses in reducing readmissions for fragile and at-risk patients
Solution: Use HRS' software and reminders provided for patients to take their daily vitals
Results: HHVN launched the new generation of technology from Health Recovery Solutions (HRS) in 2015 to
												support the care of their most fragile and at-risk patients. Of the 474 patients placed on the HRS Patient Connect®
												Platform from April 2015 to April 2016, there was a 4.2% 30-day readmission rate, which is a 75% reduction in
												overall 30-day hospital readmissions for chronic disease patients. The state average in Maine is 16.6%.
											













FirstHealth of The Carolinas

Challenge: Reduce 30-day hospital readmissions for CHF, Diabetes and COPD patients
Solution: Implement the HRS remote patient-monitoring platform
Results: The HRS telehealth remote patient-monitoring platform has allowed FirstHealth to reduce the number
												of costly home nursing visits while improving the quality of care. First Health' home visits per 60 days in 2015
												was 4.8 visits, 40% lower than the national average. Of the 175 heart failure patients monitored to date for
												Community Care, there has been a 40% reduction in the number of hospitalizations as compared to the six months
												prior to enrollment in the Center for Telehealth. That represents over 80 avoided hospitalizations and a $560,000
												savings to the State's Medicaid Program.
											













McAuley Seton Home Care

Challenge: Reduce 30-day hospital readmissions and continue to provide quality care
Solution: Use HRS' innovative software to increase patient compliance
Results: While New York's average for 30-day home care hospital readmissions is 16.4%, Catholic Health
												and HRS were able to achieve a 6% readmission rate for its CHF patients last quarter. The low 6% 30-day readmission
												rate is mostly contributed to extremely high daily compliance rates. For example, patients using HRS's software
												and hardware engagement kits had a 90% daily adherence rate for recording their blood pressure, weight, and oxygen
												levels. They answered the daily symptom questionnaire 82% of the time.
											













Cornerstone VNA

Challenge: Reduce 30-day readmissions for CHF patients
Solution: Implement the HRS disease-specific software
Results: HRS's disease-specific software is designed to engage patients with education videos, teach-back
												quizzes, care plans and surveys, and allows for video conferencing with nurses and family members. The software
												is loaded on tablets and provides all the standard telehealth monitoring while integrated with wireless Bluetooth
												devices. With a focus on engagement and education, Cornerstone VNA now has a 4.8% 30-day readmission rate for
												its CHF patients using HRS's software.
											















What Our Clients are Saying











“Since launching with HRS we've had our best performance in terms of CHF readmission numbers. For the last two
													months we've had zero thirty day readmissions and our overall readmission rate stands at 4.4%. There's a secret
													sauce here, engaging patients in their own self care management, providing them with tools for better outcomes.”

- Anne Norris MD, CMO of Penn Care at Home



“This is not your traditional telehealth. We are transforming our model of care delivery and using technology
													in different ways to engage and empower patients and family members.”

- Andrea Lazarek-LaQuay, Chief Clinical Officer at VNA NY



“Reducing nursing visits per episode of care not only reduces the overall cost of care, but it also allows us
													to provide care to more patients with the same amount of staff. The return on investment is positive.”

- Patty Upham, First Health



“What we are doing is true population health. By addressing health literacy and engaging our patients in self-care,
													we have gone far beyond the realm of telehealth.”

- Donna DeBlois, HHVN President
