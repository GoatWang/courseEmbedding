Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D. is an American psychiatrist and researcher in the field of neuroplasticity and its application to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[1][2] He is a proponent of mind/body dualism and appeared in the 2008 Film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, in which he told interviewer Ben Stein that science should not be separated from religion.[2][3][4][5]

Brain lock[edit]
Brain lock is a term coined by Schwartz to describe obsessive-compulsive behavior and to describe a treatment plan he published in his 1997 book Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior.[6][7] In the book Schwartz claims that obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are a result of a bio-chemical imbalance where brain functions will get "locked" in an obsessive-compulsive pattern and that OCD can be self-treated by following four steps,[8] which are listed as follows:[9]



Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.
Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.
Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.
Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life.

Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D. is an American psychiatrist and researcher in the field of neuroplasticity and its application to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[1][2] He is a proponent of mind/body dualism and appeared in the 2008 Film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, in which he told interviewer Ben Stein that science should not be separated from religion.[2][3][4][5]

Brain lock[edit]
Brain lock is a term coined by Schwartz to describe obsessive-compulsive behavior and to describe a treatment plan he published in his 1997 book Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior.[6][7] In the book Schwartz claims that obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are a result of a bio-chemical imbalance where brain functions will get "locked" in an obsessive-compulsive pattern and that OCD can be self-treated by following four steps,[8] which are listed as follows:[9]



Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.
Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.
Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.
Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life.

Jeffrey M. Schwartz













                    
                    Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D. is Research Psychiatrist at UCLA School of Medicine and a seminal thinker and researcher in the field of self-directed neuroplasticity. He is the author of over 100 scientific publications in the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, and several popular books including You Are Not Your Brain: The 4-Step Solution for Changing Bad Habits, Ending Unhealthy Thinking, and Taking Control of Your Life co-authored with Rebecca Gladding, M.D. (2011), as well as The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force  (2002), and Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior  (1997). Dr. Schwartz has been featured nationally on prominent TV shows, including Oprah, 20/20, Today Show, Donahue and Leeza. He was a consultant to Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio on The Aviator (and appears with them on the bonus DVD extras of that film) and appeared in Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. Dr Schwartz's primary research interest over the past two decades has been brain imaging and cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a focus on the brain mechanisms and psychological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Dr. Schwartz's most recent academic writing has been in the field of philosophy of mind, specifically on the role of volition in human neurobiology.  He has also applied his approach of "mind over brain" to the fields of business leadership and organizational behavior, as featured in two articles in Strategy+Business magazine in 2006 and 2011.After receiving an honors degree in philosophy from the University of Rochester, Dr. Schwartz began to devote a substantial amount of time to Buddhist philosophy --- in particular to the philosophy of mindfulness, or conscious awareness, which revolves around the central idea that the mind is an active participant in the world and that its actions have a physical effect on the workings of the brain. He thus set out to find a scientific underpinning for the belief that mindfulness affects how the brain functions, and in the 1990s finally made his key discovery at UCLA. As shown on PET scans, a four-step cognitive behavioral therapy that he has pioneered is capable of actually changing the activity in a specific brain circuit of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr Schwartz's current passions include the philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, classic jazz, and the role of Christian meditation in enhancing mindful awareness and it's effects on mind-brain relations.WEB SITESwww.jeffreymschwartz.comwww.youarenotyourbrain.com

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D. is an American psychiatrist and researcher in the field of neuroplasticity and its application to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[1][2] He is a proponent of mind/body dualism and appeared in the 2008 Film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, in which he told interviewer Ben Stein that science should not be separated from religion.[2][3][4][5]

Brain lock[edit]
Brain lock is a term coined by Schwartz to describe obsessive-compulsive behavior and to describe a treatment plan he published in his 1997 book Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior.[6][7] In the book Schwartz claims that obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are a result of a bio-chemical imbalance where brain functions will get "locked" in an obsessive-compulsive pattern and that OCD can be self-treated by following four steps,[8] which are listed as follows:[9]



Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.
Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.
Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.
Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life.

Before you Hire

Financial recourse when hiring Schwarz, Jeffrey M



Licensed contractors in Wisconsin are required to obtain a surety bond.In the event of losses or damages incurred during a construction project,a homeowner can file a claim against a contractors bond.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wisconsin, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.

BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Birnbaum, Jeffrey M, MD760 Parkside AveBrooklyn, NY 11226(718) 467-4446Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Birnbaum, Jeffrey M, MD582 Henry StBrooklyn, NY 11231(718) 245-3492Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Dr. Jeffrey M Dacher, DPM3901 Nostrand Ave Ste L6Brooklyn, NY 11235(718) 648-9104Physicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Jeffrey C.

VIRTUAL MASTERCLASS SERIES


6 WEEK MASTERCLASS SERIES
DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUES FOR TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR BRAIN, CHANGING BAD HABITS & ENDING UNHEALTHY THINKING IN THIS SIX WEEK MASTERCLASS WITH TWO WORLD-LEADING AUTHORITIES IN COACHING AND NEUROSCIENCE.
DO YOU HAVE CLIENTS WHO:

Over-think problems or worry about things that are out of their control?
Place unrealistically high expectations on themselves?
Get stuck or panicked because of fear and worries?
Blame and beat up on themselves?
Engage in unhealthy behaviors to escape life’s daily stresses?
Act against their overall best interest?

You most likely answered 'yes' to one or more of these. We all do periodically. One thing is clear: when we do experience these things, we don't like it and we wish we could change it. The great news is - you can!
In the You Are Not Your Brain Virtual Masterclass Series you will learn Dr Schwartz's revolutionary 4-step solution and develop new mindfulness techniques for taking control of your brain.
Say goodbye to all the negative self talk and deceptive brain messages and hello to increased productivity, confidence, performance and happiness!
 
WATCH THE PROMO VIDEO

 
IN THIS PROGRAM YOU'LL EXPLORE EACH OF THE FOUR STEPS IN DEPTH:

RELABEL: Learn how to identify deceptive brain messages (unhealthy thoughts) as they happen
REFRAME: Learn how to change your perception on the importance of these thoughts (it's not ME, it's my BRAIN!)
REFOCUS: Learn techniques for shifting your attention to something that is positive, healthy and beneficial to you.
REVALUE: Learn the importance of truly understanding and believing that deceptive brain messages are not real, and have little to no value to you in your life.

These 4-steps were developed by Dr Schwartz initially in his work with OCD patients and have since been adopted by millions of health practitioners in their work and people in their lives through Dr Schwartz's best sellers 'You Are NOT Your Brain' and 'Brain Lock'.
WHY YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THIS MASTERCLASS:

This is a unique opportunity to spend more than a month learning from and having exclusive access to two of the world's leading authorities in neuroscience and coaching!
Connect with like-minded people in your class and learn from one another to enhance the impact the program has on your everyday life!
Bring the theory of the book to life and learn practical, new techniques for maximizing your productivity and performance everyday!
And at a price like this, you'd be crazy not to!

WHERE AND WHEN:

Use this time zone convertor to find the correct day and time in your location.
Each webinar is held on the same day and time each week for six weeks.
All webinars are recorded and sent to attendees after each webinar for you to review and embed the learning. If the time is not suitable to be on the webinar at the scheduled time you will gain value by viewing the recordings each week.
You will be sent webinar connection details one week prior to the first Webinar.
