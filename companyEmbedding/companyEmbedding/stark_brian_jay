  Home About Stark               History    Contact Us Site Map  

Seeing things differently is the natural result of building collaborative processes into all aspects of our business.  Collaboration is integral to interdisciplinary communication, firm-wide risk management and the discovery of new ideas.  Underpinning the spirit of collaboration across our organization is an incentive model for all Stark associates based on overall Firm performance.  The managerial encouragement and financial incentives to share and implement promising ideas overwhelm tendencies to silo information.  This collaborative model is the backbone of our R&D program, facilitating knowledge transfer, fresh thinking and, throughout our evolution, innovative approaches to investing.
Seeing things differently is also a statement about our  people.  By design, our headquarters’ location is a world apart from  Wall Street.  Like our founders, many of the principals and associates here share an affinity for the region, a common work ethic and a  desire for a balanced lifestyle.  Making a commitment to join Stark is not as simple as walking across the Street.  The evidence of commitment is clearly seen in the stability of our management team and the exceptionally low turnover of our investment professionals.  Talent retention and the resulting continuity and team chemistry within the organization are strengths that we believe directly accrue to investors.
