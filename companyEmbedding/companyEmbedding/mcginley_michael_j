Patent number:  5944252
                                            

Abstract:  A method of making corrugated board having at least one fold region includes the steps of securing at least two sheets of paper liner in complementary facing engagement to create a first multi-layer liner. A first set of ridges of a first corrugated paper medium is secured to the first multi-layer composite liner to create a first single-face web. At least two sheets of paper liner are secured in complementary facing engagement to create a second multi-layer composite liner. A first set of ridges of a second corrugated paper medium is secured to the second multi-layer composite liner to create a second single-face web. A selected portion of the second corrugated paper medium is compressed to create an area to be bent. A second set of ridges of the first corrugated paper medium is secured to the second multi-layer composite liner. Adhesive is applied to the second set of ridges of the second corrugated paper medium, except for the compressed selected portion.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
