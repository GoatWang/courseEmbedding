Vitamin Cottage on Wyoming Blvd in Albuquerque, New Mexico



Vitamin Cottage Natural Food Markets, Inc (NYSE: NGVC) (commonly referred to as "Vitamin Cottage" or "Natural Grocers") is a Colorado based health food chain founded in 1955 by Margaret and Philip Isely and now operated by their children. Natural Grocers are found in 19 states, mainly west of the Mississippi River. The company operates over 130 retail grocery stores in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming with approximately 3,000 employees[1] and new stores opening monthly. Products include vitamins, dietary supplements, natural and organic food, organic produce and natural body care products.[citation needed]
The company is a longtime proponent of consumer education about health and nutrition, and runs an ongoing free lecture series with nutrition and health experts for both customer and employee education. Each store provides a free trained "Nutritional Health Coach" (see nutritionist) for its customers. All education activities are science-based, refer to most recent published studies, and not related to specific products or brands.[citation needed]
The company filed an S1 registration statement with the SEC on June 18, 2012 under the name Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. As of July 25th, 2012, the company is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "NGVC".
The company has a manifesto entitled "What We Won't Sell and Why". This list includes artificial colors and flavors, artificial preservatives, irradiated food and meat raised using artificial hormones and antibiotics among others. Only USDA certified organic (see Organic certification) fruits and vegetables are sold.
Many of the company's guidelines for ensuring product purity and quality, developed over many years due to the previous lack of existing government standards, were used as the foundation for the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) legislation of 1994. Company founder Margaret Isely contributed to forming the precursor group that became the international trade group Council for Responsible Nutrition. The company maintains an active role in community education, regulatory affairs and scientific nutrition research.[citation needed]
Natural Grocers operates "Bag Free" stores, asking customers to bring reusable bags for their purchases or take a recycled box in place of plastic or paper bags.[2] The company also operates an all-green retail location in Northglenn, Colorado, employing geothermal heating and cooling among other features. The store uses net zero energy for heating and cooling the interior. All Natural Grocers locations (not just distribution centers) undergo third party audits of their organic handling and processing practices by a USDA-accredited organic certification agency and are USDA certified organic handlers/processors. The company operates in compliance with all National Organic Program rules.[citation needed]

Vitamin Cottage on Wyoming Blvd in Albuquerque, New Mexico



Vitamin Cottage Natural Food Markets, Inc (NYSE: NGVC) (commonly referred to as "Vitamin Cottage" or "Natural Grocers") is a Colorado based health food chain founded in 1955 by Margaret and Philip Isely and now operated by their children. Natural Grocers are found in 19 states, mainly west of the Mississippi River. The company operates over 130 retail grocery stores in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming with approximately 3,000 employees[1] and new stores opening monthly. Products include vitamins, dietary supplements, natural and organic food, organic produce and natural body care products.[citation needed]
The company is a longtime proponent of consumer education about health and nutrition, and runs an ongoing free lecture series with nutrition and health experts for both customer and employee education. Each store provides a free trained "Nutritional Health Coach" (see nutritionist) for its customers. All education activities are science-based, refer to most recent published studies, and not related to specific products or brands.[citation needed]
The company filed an S1 registration statement with the SEC on June 18, 2012 under the name Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. As of July 25th, 2012, the company is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "NGVC".
The company has a manifesto entitled "What We Won't Sell and Why". This list includes artificial colors and flavors, artificial preservatives, irradiated food and meat raised using artificial hormones and antibiotics among others. Only USDA certified organic (see Organic certification) fruits and vegetables are sold.
Many of the company's guidelines for ensuring product purity and quality, developed over many years due to the previous lack of existing government standards, were used as the foundation for the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) legislation of 1994. Company founder Margaret Isely contributed to forming the precursor group that became the international trade group Council for Responsible Nutrition. The company maintains an active role in community education, regulatory affairs and scientific nutrition research.[citation needed]
Natural Grocers operates "Bag Free" stores, asking customers to bring reusable bags for their purchases or take a recycled box in place of plastic or paper bags.[2] The company also operates an all-green retail location in Northglenn, Colorado, employing geothermal heating and cooling among other features. The store uses net zero energy for heating and cooling the interior. All Natural Grocers locations (not just distribution centers) undergo third party audits of their organic handling and processing practices by a USDA-accredited organic certification agency and are USDA certified organic handlers/processors. The company operates in compliance with all National Organic Program rules.[citation needed]

Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage Issues Recall on Organic Garlic Powder Due to Possible Health Risk
Contact:
Consumer:
303-986-4600, ext. 531
Monday through Friday 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mountain Standard Time
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – February 12, 2015 – LAKEWOOD, Colo. – Vitamin Cottage Natural Food Markets, Inc., a Lakewood, Colorado-based natural grocery chain, is recalling two lots of Natural Grocers brand Organic Garlic Powder as the product has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Consumption of products containing Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms) endocarditic and arthritis.
This recall was initiated after being notified of positive Salmonella findings in product sampled by the FDA.
The recalled product is packaged in clear plastic bags with Natural Grocers label notating Julian pack on dates and pricing per pound. The product was produced in size ranges of 0.25 pound to 0.30 pound. The lots being recalled are identified by Julian packed on date and include: 351-14 and 006-15
The product was distributed to Natural Grocers’ 92 stores located in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Consumers can find the specific locations of Natural Grocers stores at: http://www.naturalgrocers.com/store-locations.
Only packages bearing the Julian packed on dates listed above are subject to recall.
To date the company has received no reports of illness. Consumers who may have purchased this product should return it to the store for credit or refund.

Product Details
Nutrition Facts



	Vitamin E belongs to a family of 8 antioxidant compounds consisting of four tocopherols: alpha, beta, gamma and delta and 4 tocotreinols: also alpha, beta, gamma and delta. 

Natural vs. Synthetic 

	The most potent, natural form of vitamin E is d-alpha- tocopherol which is superior to the synthetic version, dl-alpha-tocopherol. Natural vitamin E supplement labels must express 100 % natural on the label to ensure potency.
	Natural vitamin E supplements are believed to be superior to synthetic vitamin E supplements in many ways. 

Natural vitamin E: 

	• Has a higher bioavailability rate/synthetic is only 67 % as active
	• Remains longer in body tissues/synthetic is excreted 3 times faster
	• Is made from natural vegetable oils/some synthetics made from petrochemicals
	• Is recognized by the body 

Natural Vitamin E in the Body  

	The most common form of vitamin E found in foods is gamma-tocopherol even though the body utilizes alpha-tocopherol much more effectively. Alpha-tocopherol can be measured in the blood lipoproteins in approximately ten time higher amounts than gamma-tocopherol. 
	Vitamin E prevents cell damage in the body by inhibiting the oxidation of lipids, fats and the formation of free radicals. Vitamin E works in cooperation with vitamin C to neutralize free radicals and protects other fat-soluble vitamins from being destroyed by oxidation. 

Heart Health 

	The general consensus in the medical profession tells us there is a connection between vitamin E and heart health. Adding vitamin E to fats and oils prevents them from becoming rancid and gives them antioxidant properties. Oxidation of fats is a key factor in the formation of plaque adhering to blood vessel walls. 

	Other ways natural vitamin E protects heart health: 

	• Prevents the cells’ protective coatings from becoming rancid by attacking free radicals
	• Improves oxygen utilization

Vitamin E’s Other Health Contributions 

	Protecting the heart is just one of vitamin E’s contributions to health.  Vitamin E plays a part in many other aspects of our well-being. 
	Vitamin E’s powerful antioxidant properties may also: 

	• Protect skin against damage from UV rays 
	• Enhance immune responses


	Our skin, hair and nails may show improvement from taking natural vitamin E.
	This may be seen in the form of: 

	• Healthy, glowing skin 
	• Shiny, strong hair 
	• Nails free from chipping and breaking 

	For optimal health results consume foods containing vitamin E along with a daily dose of a 100% natural vitamin E supplement. 

Food sources 

asparagus, avocadoes, cold pressed oils, dark leafy greens, legumes, certain nuts/seeds, soybeans, sweet potatoes and whole grains. 

*Be cautious when:

	• Taking blood thinners/no more than 200 international units (IU)
	• Diabetic or have rheumatic heart disease or an overactive thyroid/no more than recommended dose
	• You have high blood pressure/start with small amount, then increase slowly
	 

Suggested Use: As a dietary supplement, take one softgel daily, preferably with meals.

	 


Other Ingredients:  Softgel Capsule (gelatin, glycerin, water, carob), Soybean Oil, Beeswax and Soy Lecithin.  Contains only 100% Natural Vitamin E.
