Parkinson's Breakthrough


Cutting Edge Stem Cell Therapy
Painless Procedure

Commonly, significant positive results are seen in 3 to 6 months














Parkinson’s Treatment










Treatment
The treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where Stem Cells (cellular building blocks) are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously (under the skin) in Parkinson's patients. The whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects.

Following the treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will travel throughout the body, detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them. The Fetal Stem Cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function, boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process. These highly adaptive cells then remain in the body, continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter.
Safety

As with any medical treatment, safety should be of the highest priority. The Stem Cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities. Utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the United States for Stem Cell research and transplant. Our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective Fetal Stem Cell treatment possible. And, unlike other types of Stem Cells, there is no danger of the body’s rejection of Fetal Stem Cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity (cellular fingerprint). This unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system, which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections.
Results
With over 3000 patients treated, Stem Cell Of America has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses, conditions and injuries. Often, in cases where the diseases continued to worsen, our patients have reported substantial improvements following the Stem Cell treatment.

Commonly, positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in Parkinson's patients.
To view follow up letters from patients, please visit the patient experiences page on our website.

All statements, opinions, and advice on this page is provided for educational information only. It is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and care. Like all medical treatments and procedures, results may significantly vary and positive results may not always be achieved. Please contact us so we may evaluate your specific case.

 Frequently Asked Questions



Frequently Asked Questions
Does the Stem Cell treatment have any age requirements?
No, Stem Cell Of America accepts patients of all ages.
How much does the treatment cost?
There are multiple factors in determining the cost of treatment. Please contact us to have your case evaluated.
Does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost?
No, the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance.
Do you accept patients from outside of the United States?
Yes, we routinely accept patients from Canada, England, Australia and other countries all over the world.
Is the Stem Cell treatment administered by Stem Cell Of America safe?
Yes, the cells are tested for 14 different criteria, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, as well as viability. Moreover, we use PCR DNA testing, which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the United States for other Stem Cell treatments.
Will my body reject the Fetal Stem Cells?
No, Fetal Stem Cellsare “immune privileged”.  This means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching, use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection. Therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient, such as graft-versus-host disease.  Because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction, which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection.
Does your Stem Cell Treatment have any side effects?
Our Fetal Stem Cell treatment has no known negative side effects.
What diseases and conditions is the Stem Cell treatment available for?
A partial list of disease and conditions that Stem Cell of America has successfully treated includes:

Alzheimer's
Arthritis
Autism
Brain Damage
Cancer
Cerebral Palsy
Chronic Pain
Cystic Fibrosis
Diabetes
Epilepsy
Fibromyalgia
Heart Disease
Kidney Disease
Liver Disease
Lung Disease
Lupus
Multiple Sclerosis
Muscular Dystrophy
Parkinson's
Seizures
Spinal Cord Injury
Stroke
and others

Due to the rapid advances in Stem Cell science, some diseases or conditions may not be listed. Please contact us to get additional information.
How quickly will I see results after the Stem Cell treatment?
Every person is of course different. Each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors. Commonly, significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment. At times, these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment.
How many Stem Cell treatments will I need?
After the first treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will continue to proliferate and repair. Some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process. The decision is yours. If you decide to repeat the treatment, usually a waiting period of 6 months is recommended.
How do the Fetal Stem Cells actually work to bring about healing?
Fetal Stem Cells are the cellular building blocks of the 220 cell types within the body. The Fetal Stem Cells used by Stem Cell Of America remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue, organ or cell type within the body.
Fetal Stem Cells also release Cytokines. Cytokines are cell-derived, hormone-like polypeptides that regulate cellular replication, differentiation, and activation. Cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function, allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted Fetal Stem Cells for repair and new growth.
How many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition?
In the past 2 decades, Stem Cell Of America has arranged for the treatment of over three thousand patients with Fetal Stem Cells. The number of patients continues to grow. Please contact us to get specific information on a disease or condition.
Where are you located?
Stem Cell Of America has offices in the United States and a treatment center in Mexico.

We have courses and resources for all learning levels, so take a look at our catalog of courses - all offered as a service of Youth for Christ International in partnership with RBC Ministries. Jesus commanded us to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matt 28:19). We believe God has called Youth for Christ (YFC) to make disciples who are disciple makers and who lead by their godliness in lifestyle, devotion to the Word of God and prayer, passion for sharing the love of Christ and commitment to social involvement. The YFC University is designed to provide youth leadership training, biblical study courses, theological education and spiritual formation curriculum to any young person, volunteer, church youth leader and YFC staff in the world who wishes to access these training/educational resources in the context of their geographical, cultural, and social environment.

ESSA Pharma Inc. Key Developments

ESSA Pharma Announces Receipt Of NASDAQ Notice Of Bid Price Deficiency
Jul 20 17
ESSA Pharma Inc. announced that it has received written notification (Notification Letter) from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of  $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company's common shares for the 30 consecutive business days from June 6, 2017, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until January 15, 2018, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least US $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by January 15, 2018, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and January 15, 2018 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period. During this time, the Company's common shares will continue to be listed and trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company is also listed on the TSX and the Notification Letter does not affect the Company's compliance status with such listing.


ESSA Pharma Announces Data from Phase 1 Trial of EPI-506
May 17 17
ESSA Pharma Inc. announced that early data from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its product candidate, EPI-506, will be presented in a poster presentation at the upcoming 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. EPI-506 is currently in an open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of end-stage patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or both, and may have also received one prior line of chemotherapy. At the time of the abstract submission, minor PSA declines in 3/18 patients had been observed at doses from 80 to 1,280 mg. The respective human exposure at these dose levels correlate to sub-therapeutic exposure derived from mouse xenograft studies. The data demonstrate that EPI-506 is well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, with pharmacokinetics indicating dose proportionality at doses up to 1,280 mg. Since the submission of the abstract, the company has completed one additional cohort of 2400 mg, and is currently enrolling patients in two additional cohorts dosed at 3,600 mg once-daily or 1,800 mg twice-daily (3,600 mg total daily dose). In a clinical study update in April 2017, ESSA reported that pharmacological results confirmed that a dose of 2,400 mg achieves drug exposures within the targeted therapeutic range. ESSA plans to obtain additional data from a broader group of patients at higher dose levels to aid in the determination of an optimal Phase 2 dose.


ESSA Pharma Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 15 17
ESSA Pharma Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net loss of USD 7,611,000 or USD 0.26 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of USD 1,052,000 or USD 0.04 per basic and diluted share reported in the same period last year.

Parkinson's Breakthrough


Cutting Edge Stem Cell Therapy
Painless Procedure
Limited Space Available
Commonly, significant positive results are seen in 3 to 6 months














Parkinson’s Treatment










Treatment
The treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where Stem Cells (cellular building blocks) are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously (under the skin) in Parkinson's patients. The whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects.

Following the treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will travel throughout the body, detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them. The Fetal Stem Cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function, boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process. These highly adaptive cells then remain in the body, continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter.
Safety

As with any medical treatment, safety should be of the highest priority. The Stem Cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities. Utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the United States for Stem Cell research and transplant. Our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective Fetal Stem Cell treatment possible. And, unlike other types of Stem Cells, there is no danger of the body’s rejection of Fetal Stem Cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity (cellular fingerprint). This unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system, which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections.
Results
With over 3000 patients treated, Stem Cell Of America has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses, conditions and injuries. Often, in cases where the diseases continued to worsen, our patients have reported substantial improvements following the Stem Cell treatment.

Commonly, positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in Parkinson's patients.
To view follow up letters from patients, please visit the patient experiences page on our website.

All statements, opinions, and advice on this page is provided for educational information only. It is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and care. Like all medical treatments and procedures, results may significantly vary and positive results may not always be achieved. Please contact us so we may evaluate your specific case.

 Frequently Asked Questions



Frequently Asked Questions
Does the Stem Cell treatment have any age requirements?
No, Stem Cell Of America accepts patients of all ages.
How much does the treatment cost?
There are multiple factors in determining the cost of treatment. Please contact us to have your case evaluated.
Does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost?
No, the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance.
Do you accept patients from outside of the United States?
Yes, we routinely accept patients from Canada, England, Australia and other countries all over the world.
Is the Stem Cell treatment administered by Stem Cell Of America safe?
Yes, the cells are tested for 14 different criteria, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, as well as viability. Moreover, we use PCR DNA testing, which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the United States for other Stem Cell treatments.
Will my body reject the Fetal Stem Cells?
No, Fetal Stem Cellsare “immune privileged”.  This means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching, use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection. Therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient, such as graft-versus-host disease.  Because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction, which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection.
Does your Stem Cell Treatment have any side effects?
Our Fetal Stem Cell treatment has no known negative side effects.
What diseases and conditions is the Stem Cell treatment available for?
A partial list of disease and conditions that Stem Cell of America has successfully treated includes:

Alzheimer's
Arthritis
Autism
Brain Damage
Cancer
Cerebral Palsy
Chronic Pain
Cystic Fibrosis
Diabetes
Epilepsy
Fibromyalgia
Heart Disease
Kidney Disease
Liver Disease
Lung Disease
Lupus
Multiple Sclerosis
Muscular Dystrophy
Parkinson's
Seizures
Spinal Cord Injury
Stroke
and others

Due to the rapid advances in Stem Cell science, some diseases or conditions may not be listed. Please contact us to get additional information.
How quickly will I see results after the Stem Cell treatment?
Every person is of course different. Each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors. Commonly, significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment. At times, these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment.
How many Stem Cell treatments will I need?
After the first treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will continue to proliferate and repair. Some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process. The decision is yours. If you decide to repeat the treatment, usually a waiting period of 6 months is recommended.
How do the Fetal Stem Cells actually work to bring about healing?
Fetal Stem Cells are the cellular building blocks of the 220 cell types within the body. The Fetal Stem Cells used by Stem Cell Of America remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue, organ or cell type within the body.
Fetal Stem Cells also release Cytokines. Cytokines are cell-derived, hormone-like polypeptides that regulate cellular replication, differentiation, and activation. Cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function, allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted Fetal Stem Cells for repair and new growth.
How many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition?
