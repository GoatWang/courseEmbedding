Medical Properties Trust: Quality REIT, But Wait For A Dip - Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Medical Properties Trust: Quality REIT, But Wait For A DipJun.20.17 | About: Medical Properties (MPW) Michael Boyd Long/short equity, contrarian, medium-term horizon, mid-capMarketplaceIndustrial InsightsSummaryMedical Properties Trust has ridden a wave of bad news over the past six months; shares have held up quite well all things considered.That is a testament to underlying quality of management, who have also done a good job of spinning bad news in a positive light.The recent Steward/IASIS transaction is a great one from an accretion stand-point, but tenant concentration concerns are going to remain elevated.If you own it already, it is worth a hold. Accumulate in the $11.50/share range assuming the long-term story isn't damaged.Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) has traveled a bumpy road over the past year, but I think that company management has done an excellent job of dispelling relevant fears surrounding the company's portfolio during that time. Healthcare REITs in general have been under pressure, and any time an REIT has a key tenant file for bankruptcy, investors have a tendency to run for the exits. In a further build of pressure, the recent credit outlook cut to negative from S&P (following a major acquisition announcement) likely did not help either. Is the recent haircut in share price enough, or would investors be better suited waiting for a better price? Business Overview Medical Properties Trust acquires and develops healthcare facilities, leasing those assets to operators under long-term triple net leases, as well as making mortgage loans to operators collateralized by their real estate assets. Bear in mind the company does take advantage of the RIDEA structure in some situations, a law which allows REITs to benefit from underlying operating performance of the asset via equity investment, equity-like loans. Cash flow and returns from these investments are going to be more volatile than triple-net leasing. Total RIDEA investment totaled $106M at the end of fiscal 2016 - not a large investment by any means, but it is an aspect of operations investors should be aware of. While more than three quarters of revenue comes from the United States, the company is starting to nibble overseas, particularly within the German market. The United Kingdom is a likely focus point, as well as Spain (new facility just opened there in Valencia). Management has expressed continued interest in overseas expansion, such as CFO Steven Hamner's comments that the company will be back in Europe to "complete what we started" in 2017. However, both domestically and overseas, property type emphasis is on General Acute Care Hospitals ("GACH"), which have grown from 60% of revenue in 2014 to 64% in the most recent period. Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals ("IRH") have seen growing emphasis as well. The company has been moving away from Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals ("LTACH"), or facilities that require specialty care with longer stays and intense special treatment for patients (5% of assets). Generally, these facilities are higher margin for operators, but usually see significantly more volatility in earnings. GACH, which provide in-patient care for acute conditions as well as ambulatory care through hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms, are performing well and are generally viewed (rightly in my opinion) more safely. In a similar vein, company properties have been converting to hospital outpatient departments ("HOPDs"). In general, rates come down after HOPD conversion, but margins stay within spitting distance just from increased volume. The added benefit is that higher patient traffic creates a more stable revenue base, so any downtick in margin is made up for in volume. The impact of this (weak LTACH results, strength from GACH, HOPD facilities) can be seen in the most recent reported quarter, where LTACH EBITDAR coverage fell 1.3x, compared to 3.9x coverage at GACH. It wouldn't be a surprise to see these LTACH facilities eventually cut off from the operation and sold - if the price is right.
 Adeptus Bankruptcy Implications Texas-based Adeptus, the nation's largest free-standing emergency room operator, officially announced bankruptcy in April of this year. The company blamed a tight regulatory market, as well as vendor PST Services botching its revenue cycle management services for the company, which caused nearly $100M in write-offs. The court has approved the company's restructuring plan, which involved affiliates of long-term shareholder Deerfield providing interim funding, which follows the move by Deerfield buying out $212M in bank debt early in April. The newly capitalized Adeptus will assume 80% of master leased facilities at current rates, with the rest either being released to the prior venture partner and the rest (15%) being either sold or re-leased to new operators. Medical Properties Trust will provide a one-time credit of $3M during the twelve months post-bankruptcy. There are thirteen facilities being released from the Adeptus master lease, six of them within ninety days of bankruptcy existence and the rest after one year; Medical Properties Trust has the option to sell or re-lease sooner. Until they are separated from the master lease, Adeptus will be responsible for 100% of current rent throughout bankruptcy and all the way up through the release date. Management has stated interest is "very high" from multiple operators on these thirteen properties, and the company believes it can either sell or re-lease without any material adverse impact. Medical Properties Trust management has done a solid job of spinning this story as positive; despite 7% of NOI having been caught up in a tenant bankruptcy, the story has instead been shown as a testament to the strong underwriting and underlying value of the company's real estate. I can't say I disagree. Over the company's thirteen-year history, during which the company has owned more than 250 hospitals, there have been no signs of the company ever taking what I would call a material real estate impairment. Even missed rental payments have been few and far between.
 Steward/IASIS Acquisition Management made it clear that the company had plenty of dry powder over the last several years. Post equity raise, pro forma debt to EBITDA of 4.5x was well below the company's target of 5-5.5x, as well as below Medical Properties Trust's peer group. The company's quarterly press release stated the company believed it had the ability to make up to $1.5B in additional investments without the need of additional equity, all while keeping the debt ratio within self-imposed levels. That should have been a clear sign what was on the horizon. This is essentially a three-way deal, with Steward Health Care acquiring IASIS Healthcare operations, with Medical Properties Trust stepping in to control IASIS real estate via sale/leaseback and mortgage transactions. Total consideration is $1,400M, roughly two thirds split between rental income and mortgage interest income (in line with current consolidated company breakdown). Medical Properties Trust has quickly been building a relationship with Steward, which is now the largest private for-profit hospital operator in the United States. Back in October of last year, the company closed on a portfolio of nine acute care hospitals in Massachusetts for $1,250M ($600M sale/leaseback, $600M in mortgages, $50M RIDEA investment). Given that this prior transaction pushed Steward to the company's top tenant by gross assets (17.5%), after this deal, that will now be above 30%. Tenant concentration concerns are likely on the minds of many, particularly given the consolidated Steward 2018 EBITDAR coverage estimate of 2.83x is slightly below the total Medical Properties Trust portfolio (3.35x). While Steward is private (controlled by Cerberus), it did provide some pro forma estimates of Steward's balance sheet that pin net debt/EBITDA leverage in the 3.8x range, well below peer averages. While the knee-jerk concern is concern over whether Steward could be the next Adeptus, both companies operate in different markets and having the backing of Cerberus ($30B in private equity AUM) will always give Steward an edge if things do turn south. Nonetheless, management is looking to get Steward's exposure down below 25%, either by joint ventures or straight growth. This likely isn't a speedy way to reduce exposure, particularly given leverage is now in the target range, so growth via acquisition is not going to be aggressive over the next several years.
 Valuation, The Final Word Medical Properties Trust does not break out net operating income ("NOI") that I can see, but backing into it from 2016 GAAP ($342M GAAP operating income - $46M gain on property sales + $7M impairment charge + $94M depreciation) gets us to $397M in NOI. Based on current enterprise value, the gut reaction is to figure that the implied cap rate is 5.1%, but the company has been making substantial moves as of late. Medical Properties Trust recently priced a substantial equity deal to raise cash after Q1 close to fund the $1,400M Steward/IASIS acquisition, funded by that equity raise ($547M), a substantial portion of cash on hand ($447M) and a likely senior unsecured debt issuance (~$500M). If investors assume a 10% cap rate on acquisition (current guidance), expectations should be for $140M in additional net operating income, along with ~$20M in natural NOI growth this coming year. After the impact on enterprise value from the Steward transaction, it appears the entirety of the portfolio will trade at a 6.5% cap rate, assuming no real change in market value of the company's shares by the time all the pieces fall into places. This points to a slight premium to net asset value ("NAV"), given historical sales history of similar free-standing emergency room properties. For instance, Medical Properties Trust divested several assets associated with the Capella Healthcare merger from early 2016 recently, receiving roughly 7.5% cap rates on those sales. Such a premium (~15%) to NAV would not be outlandish in the healthcare REIT space, but for those that love fishing for REITs trading at or below NAV, a share price in the $11.50/share range would be where you should start nibbling. I think that is the way to place this one. Medical Properties Trust is going to trade around yield, and I think the distribution isn't going to see any outsized growth in the short term, given the likely focus on reducing leverage back down. Fair value is my estimate in the $14.50/share range, which would put the yield at 6.6%, a little bit of a discount to historical levels given overall market sentiment, fresh counterparty risk, and a more worrisome balance sheet. Picking up shares in the mid $11s/share builds in 25% upside, a minimum level that I personally look for before considering a purchase. With that said, holding at current prices likely isn't going to hurt anyone. The company is well-run, has excellent growth opportunities, and is a clear leader in this space; it is worth watching for anyone looking for income-based REIT plays.

3 Embarrassingly Cheap Dividend Stocks
Kinder Morgan, Medical Properties Trust, and Summit Midstream Partners all trade for less than 10 times cash flow.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)

Some higher-yielding dividend stocks are cheap for a reason: Investors don't believe that the company can sustain its payout due to deteriorating financials. That said, other times the market gets a stock completely wrong, which seems to be the case with Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW), and Summit Midstream Partners (NYSE:SMLP). All three companies trade at embarrassingly cheap valuations these days, which means investors can pick up their compelling yields at bargain-basement prices.
A ridiculously cheap cash flow stream
While pipeline giant Kinder Morgan's 2.6% yield might not catch the eye of some income investors, its low valuation should grab the attention of bargain hunters. Thanks to the stable stream of cash flow that the company's pipelines and storage terminals generate, Kinder Morgan expects to produce $4.46 billion of distributable cash flow (DCF) this year, which works out to $1.99 per share. At its current stock price of around $19 per share, that works out to a price-to-DCF multiple of just 9.5. Put another way, the company has a free cash flow yield of 10.5%, which is what the stock would yield if Kinder Morgan paid out 100% of its cash flow. For a company that has traditionally traded at a mid-teens DCF multiple along with the rest of its pipeline peers, the stock is ridiculously cheap right now.

Meanwhile, income investors will love to hear that Kinder Morgan's dividend should increase substantially over the next year. The company currently only pays out a quarter of its cash flow in dividends, which is well below the 50% to 90%-plus that most other pipeline companies pay out. However, after spending the past two years shoring up its balance sheet and lining up financing for growth projects, Kinder Morgan is likely to use a significant portion of future excess cash flow for dividends starting next year. That looming dividend increase, along with visible cash flow growth from upcoming expansion projects, suggests it could be a gold mine for income investors, especially considering its cheap valuation these days.
A healthy dividend for a rock-bottom price
Hospital-property-owning REIT Medical Properties Trust will appeal to income-hungry investors given its current yield of 7.4%. Normally when a yield gets that high, it's a warning sign. However, that's not the case at Medical Properties Trust. The company has a top-notch balance sheet because it has one of the lowest leverage ratios in its peer group. Furthermore, rental contracts and mortgage agreements underpin its properties and support the company's forecast that it will produce $1.35 to $1.40 per share in funds from operations (FFO) this year, which more than adequately covers its current dividend run rate of $0.96 per share.
Instead of weak financials, the driving force behind the company's eye-popping yield is its dirt-cheap valuation. At its recent share price of around $12, the company trades at just 9.0 times the midpoint of its FFO guidance, which conversely works out to a FFO yield of 11%. For comparison's sake, leading healthcare REIT Welltower (NYSE:HCN) trades at 18 times expected 2017 FFO, or a FFO yield of just 5.5%. That's despite the fact that Welltower had a higher leverage ratio of 5.26 debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), while Medical Properties' leverage was a historically low 4.5 last quarter. Meanwhile, with that low leverage and healthy coverage ratio, Medical Properties Trust has the financial firepower to buy more properties and grow its FFO and dividend.

Weighed down by the unknown
Pipeline and processing company MLP Summit Midstream Partners offers the highest yield in this group at 9.7%. When a yield gets that high, it's typically a warning sign from the market that it doesn't expect the current payout rate to last. That said, in Summit Midstream Partners' case, its payout appears to be on solid ground. The company expects to produce between $2.65 and $2.88 per unit in distributable cash flow this year, which would more than adequately cover its current annual payout of $2.30 per unit. Meanwhile, with several expansion projects underway, the company estimates that it could potentially resume distribution growth by year-end. Providing further support to that view are the facts that 98% of its cash flow comes from long-term fee-based contracts, and the company has a relatively low leverage ratio for an MLP, at 4.35 debt to EBITDA.
Given those metrics, Summit Midstream Partners appears to be seriously cheap right now, trading at just 8.4 times the midpoint of its 2017 DCF guidance, or a DCF yield of 11.9%. If there is one concern, it's that the company owes its parent a deferred payment in 2020 to finance the balance of a large drop-down transaction it completed last year. At the moment, the company expects that payment to be between $800 million and $900 million. While the company doesn't have that kind of cash lying around, it does have until 2020 to raise that capital it needs, so it can wait for a more opportune time than the present. That said, the suspense of how it will pay for the deal weighs heavily on Summit Midstream Partners' unit price, which is providing the opportunity for risk-tolerant investors to buy this high-yield stock for an unbelievably low price.
Investor takeaway
The market is making a big mistake with these stocks by having them sell for valuations that would imply their dividends aren't on solid ground. Quite the opposite is true, since all three generate stable cash flow supported by long-term contracts, and have solid balance sheets and healthy coverage ratios. Because of those strong metrics, and the visible growth prospects these companies have on the horizon, their dividends are likely going to head higher in the years ahead. This suggests that investors who buy at today's cheap prices could do very well once the market realizes its mistake.

Medical Properties Trust, Inc. bridges the gap between the growing demand for high-quality healthcare and the ability to deliver it cost-effectively. Specializing in acute care, community and rehabilitation hospitals, this
healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) provides operators access to capital for facility improvements, technology upgrades, staff additions and new construction through long-term net leases of real estate assets. By reinvesting non-earning assets into operations, MPT clients are able to participate in the growth of the largest sector of the U.S. economy.




MPT to Invest $1.4 Billion to Acquire 11 Hospitals, Expanding Its Relationship with Steward Health Care

Birmingham, AL – May 19, 2017:  Medical Properties Trust, Inc., (NYSE: MPW) has signed definitive agreements to acquire the real estate interests of 11 hospitals across four states to be operated by Steward Health Care, one of the most innovative and successful hospital operators in the United States.
The $1.4 billion transaction includes 10 community-focused acute care hospitals and one behavioral health facility currently operated by IASIS Healthcare in high-growth urban and suburban markets in Utah, Arizona, Texas and Arkansas. Steward and IASIS have separately announced their intention to merge, and MPT’s investment is conditioned upon the completion of that merger agreement.

Modern Healthcare Feature Story Highlights MPT's Recent Purchase of Steward Health Care's Real Estate Interests

In a feature story focusing on REIT financing as a source of capital for the expansion of for-profit hospital chains, Modern Healthcare quotes both Medical Properties Trust’s CEO Edward K. Aldag, Jr. and Steward Health Care’s CEO Ralph de la Torré, M.D. on the $1.25 billion deal their companies struck in September.
Entitled “The REIT Way to Finance Growth,” the article lists the transaction among the “Top 10 largest M&A deals in Q3 2016.” 
Noting that most healthcare REITs focus their investments on medical office buildings and ambulatory centers, the article acknowledges MPT as “the established leader” in the hospital REIT sector, with 240 facilities in its portfolio.

COMPANY PROFILE/ABOUT US
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. is a different kind of real estate investment trust - by design.
MPT has carved a unique niche in the largest and fastest-growing segment of the U.S. economy. Unlike other real estate investment trusts - even those categorized as healthcare REITs - MPT focuses exclusively on providing capital to acute care facilities of all kinds through long-term triple-net leases. And, unlike other sources of capital, MPT provides 100 percent financing to reduce an organization's overall cost of capital by unlocking the value of its real estate assets.
By allowing healthcare operators to tap the value of their real estate and channel that capital into facility improvements, technology upgrades, staff additions and even new construction, MPT bridges the gap between the growing demand for high-quality healthcare and the ability to deliver it efficiently and cost-effectively.  In essence, MPT enables hospitals to increase their returns from what they know best - operations.
Edward K. Aldag, Jr. and the management team he carefully assembled have parlayed his vision for a new kind of healthcare REIT into a model for efficient healthcare delivery. Given the nature of the marketplace and expectations for healthcare spending to rise to 20 percent of GDP by 2024, MPT's formula and timing appear to have been just right.
By implementing its solid business model and deploying the talent of a diverse management team that understands the nuances of healthcare financing and healthcare operations, MPT has managed to grow its assets to more than $6 billion in a little over 10 years. And the company's prospects for continued growth and diversification remain strong.
MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCE
Because hospitals are truly specialized buildings that require a keen understanding of operational details, Ed Aldag knew that assembling a strong management team with a breadth of healthcare experience would be key to the success of a hospital-focused REIT. Strong healthcare, finance and real estate backgrounds would be invaluable components, but the healthcare operations component - and the contacts such experience cultivates - became the cornerstone of the MPT financial model.
As the only healthcare REIT focusing exclusively on hospitals, MPT brings to its clients considerable experience in both healthcare real estate and healthcare operations. Virtually every member of the MPT team hails from the healthcare arena, including senior-level executives who have managed hospital operations or physician practices. This expertise is the reason MPT is the only healthcare REIT in the marketplace that acquires and develops general acute care hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, and other medical and surgical facilities.
Medical Properties Trust's dynamic management team combines extensive experience in:

Acquiring, developing, owning, managing and leasing healthcare facilities;
Managing investments in healthcare facilities;
Acquiring healthcare companies;
Managing real estate companies; and 
Operating healthcare facilities, including many years of service in executive positions for hospitals and other healthcare providers, as well as in physician practice management and hospital/physician relations.

Board of Directors










As the only healthcare REIT focused exclusively on funding hospitals and other facilities where patients must be admitted by doctors, Medical Properties Trust brings to the table unparalleled expertise in healthcare real estate, healthcare finance and healthcare operations. 
Unlike other sources of capital, MPT is prepared to provide up to 100% financing from $10 million to $1 billion for hospital acquisitions, facility expansions, sale-leasebacks and new developments including facility replacement. And physician participation is welcomed.

Style Scores:



C Value | D Growth | F Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
