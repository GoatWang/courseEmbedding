Casey's William Walljasper Sits Down for Candid Interview
The Wall Street Journal interview says company cut down on franchising initiatives.

August 4, 2008, 08:00 pm



NEW YORK -- William J. Walljasper, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Casey’s General Stores, sat down with The Wall Street Journal for an interview, than delved into the company’s unique approach to the industry. Starting with a single store in Iowa in 1968, the company now operates in nine states boasting over 1,450 locations. With the majority of the stores located in rural communities of 3,000 residents of less, Walljasper told the paper, "We serve not only as the gas station, but also, in many cases, the grocery store and restaurant." This is a two-fold strategy as it sets the stage for less competition from a convenience store perspective as well as a quick-serve restaurant perspective.With a one-size-fits-all approach, Casey’s brand, explained Walljasper, is further defined by its food service offerings. "Some of the things that differentiate our company in the convenience store industry would be the fact that we do have a proprietary prepared food program. We make from scratch not only pizza, but donuts as well, and offer a wide variety of other products. In fact, we are a top 10 retailer of pizza and donuts in the nation."In addition, the company also owns all its assets, "which is unique in the business," and it self-distributes approximately 90 percent of the grocery products in its stores, Walljasper said. "It comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters," he told The Wall Street Journal. In recent years the company cut down on its franchising initiatives. Walljasper explained that as of April 30, 2008, the company has 14 franchise locations compared to the approximate 200 locations it once had. "We started franchising back in the 1970s as a way to grow critical mass. We didn't have the capital to grow at that point. We haven’t issued a new franchise since we went public back in 1983," he told the paper. "Since that point, we have purchased many of those stores back and converted them over to corporate locations, and we will be out of the franchise business at the end of this calendar year. All remaining franchise agreements will expire by the end of the calendar year."As with all c-store retailers, escalating gas prices are causing problems and issues for Casey’s. Gasoline consumption, Walljasper said, is down by roughly two percent. "However, given that, coupled with a little more challenging economic time nationwide, our same-store customer count continues to be very solid," he continued. "People are still coming into our stores, they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying….They are filling up with fewer gallons per stop, which means they are coming back perhaps a little bit more often to our stores."

Interview with Casey's General Stores CFO William Walljasper - Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Interview with Casey's General Stores CFO William WalljasperAug. 4.08 | About: Casey's General (CASY) The Wall Street Transcript On August 4, The Wall Street Transcript interviewed William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY). Key excerpts follow:

TWST: We would like to begin with a brief historical sketch of the company and a picture of the things you are doing now.
Mr. Walljasper: We opened our first store back in 1968 and since then we have grown from one store in the State of Iowa to encompass a nine-state area of the states here in the Midwest. Currently, we have over 1,450 locations. We are really unique in the convenience store industry and with our business model, locating stores in smaller rural communities throughout the Midwest. The majority of our stores are in towns of 3,000-person population or less. We serve not only as the gas station but also in many cases the grocery store and restaurant. Some of the things that differentiate our company in the convenience store industry would be the fact that we do have a proprietary prepared food program. We make from scratch not only pizza, but donuts as well and offer a wide variety of other products. In fact, we are a top 10 retailer of pizza and donuts in the nation. We also own all of our assets, which is unique in the business, and self-distribute about 90% of the grocery products in our store; it comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters.
TWST: Would you tell us more about the reasons for the company's success?
Mr. Walljasper: I think it all starts back when we actually opened our first store. The next two stores actually were in communities of smaller populations than our first. I think at that point we found a niche of servicing some of the smaller rural communities that haven't had this type of service before. So in that regard, being located in smaller communities, there is less competition not only from a convenience store perspective, but less competition from a quick-serve restaurant perspective, from an entry-level labor perspective, lower cost to build and even lower cost to purchase when we go under acquisition strategy. So it has been a nice, evolving product. We are very vertically integrated and we have stayed vertically integrated since the start of the company and I think that's a good reason for the success that we have. Also by nature the company has been what I will call relatively conservative and I think that's been a very positive thing for the company, not growing just for the sake of growing, but having to manage that growth plan. We have very low debt, a very strong balance sheet. In fact we would be considered investment grade. So I think all those components kind of rolled up sum up the success of our company.
TWST: I believe that you used to have a number of franchises. Why have you cut down on franchising?
Mr. Walljasper: That is correct. We currently, at least as of April 30, 2008, have 14 franchise locations. We used to have over 200 franchise locations. We started franchising back in the 1970s as a way to grow critical mass; we didn't have the capital to grow at that point. We haven't issued a new franchise since we went public back in 1983. Since that point, we have purchased many of those stores back and converted them over to corporate locations, and we will be out of the franchise business at the end of this calendar year. All remaining franchise agreements will expire by the end of the calendar year.
TWST: How is the price of gas  affecting you?
Mr. Walljasper: The price of gas certainly has been more of a challenging issue here recently. It's affecting us in several ways. First of all, gasoline consumption — it's no secret that gasoline consumption nationwide has been down over the last year, somewhere around 2% to 3%. Our same-store gallons over the most recent fiscal year we completed ending, April 30, 2008, were down 2%. We have seen some elasticity in demand with gas gallons.
However, given that, coupled with a little more challenging economic time nationwide, our same-store customer count continues to be very solid. People are still coming into our stores, they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying. They are continuing that process. They are filling up with fewer gallons per stop, which means they are coming back perhaps a little bit more often to our stores.
TWST: What are the main opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for you?
Mr. Walljasper: I think the opportunities for us stem from a comment I made earlier about the fragmented nature of our market area. Just to reiterate, about two-thirds of the convenience stores in our market area operate with 10 stores or less, which means they have a different critical mass than we do and a different infrastructure than we do.
We purchase direct from the vendors, we don't go through a food broker, which gives us some buying power in that regard. We also have a very strong balance sheet, which enables us to get very good credit and payable terms. For example, with gasoline, several years ago a load of gasoline would cost $10,000.  Now a load of gasoline is somewhere between $30,000 and $35,000. We turn our gasoline about every three days and our payment terms are 10 days. I am pretty confident that some of the smaller operators would not have that same type of payment term. It's been, quite frankly, a crunch on working capital for some of the smaller operators. So that creates an acquisition opportunity. Anytime there is pressure in our industry, I believe it creates opportunities to perhaps purchase some of the operators that don't have the same type of structure that we do. So the opportunities in that regard going forward from within are not only our nine-state market area, but we also did a warehouse expansion several years ago, which will enable us to add another 1,000 stores above the ones we currently have, which means that we may look to go into other states that border our current market areas, states such as Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. Those are states that we are looking to penetrate and I think there are opportunities to be had in those states.

			College Foodservice: Innovative by Design

For so many members of my generation, the lasting image of college foodservice remains a less than positive one. We entered meal periods hoping for the best but never truly knowing what we would get. Naturally, when looking at today's college foodservice environment, we can't help but marvel at the progress this industry segment continues to make.

				Case Study: Casey's General Store, Ankeny, Ia.




			Published on Sunday, 02 October 2011		
 
						
							Written by Lisa White, Contributing Editor					

Competing in the crowded pizza segment is a challenge for any restaurant, let alone a retail convenience store chain. Yet, Casey's General Store, a 1,600-store chain based in Ankeny, Ia., has more than competed — it has thrived. 
The Casey's prepared-food operation represents nearly 30 percent of the chain's total gross profit dollars and is one of the highest gross profit contributors, even topping fuel sales. Its flagship pizza is so popular with customers in the 11 Midwestern states the chain serves that Casey's will soon offer a delivery program.
"In terms of the number of retail outlets, we are a top 10 retailer of pizza and cake donuts in the country," says William J. Walljasper, senior vice president and CFO. "We sell a lot of prepared food."
Part of Casey's success can be attributed to the retailer's business model, which includes stores primarily in small, rural communities. "About 75 percent of our locations are in towns with 10,000 people or less, and 50 percent of our stores are in areas with populations of 3,500 or less," Walljasper says. This has helped insulate Casey's against competition from big-box retailers.
The chain, which has been in business since 1968, has offered prepared food since the early '80s. Yet, unlike many of its would-be competitors, Casey's operates kitchens that are on site instead of being centralized.
Casey's new "O" store design has helped expand its foodservice program even further, with the addition of made-to-order subs and more fresh-baked products. The chain also recently expanded its coffee bar to offer a wider variety of flavor profiles, including cappuccino and iced coffee. In addition, the company added self-service soft-serve ice cream about two years ago. This new store prototype has expanded the Casey's footprint to 3,700 square feet from 2,700 square feet.
"About half of the 1,000-square-foot addition is dedicated to prepared food," Walljasper says. "The other half is geared toward cooler space and seating."
Although Casey's has been expanding its prepared-food menu, pizza remains the focus. As a result, the chain continually adds new pizza varieties to the mix. In the last year, bacon chicken ranch, mac and cheese, and buffalo chicken varieties were introduced. "C-stores are looking for products to meet customer demand. Yet our menus are not only about product selection, but also are based on convenience," Walljasper says.
Quality is the main focus of Casey's pizza program. Its pies are made from scratch on site, using 100 percent whole-milk mozzarella cheese. Casey's menu also includes subs, which are offered in 350 locations, along with a variety of other sandwiches, chicken tenders and bakery items. Newly added menu items include quesadillas and a to-go cup with snacks, including fresh-baked mini chocolate chip cookies.
"Our older sites offer a full menu, with the exception of made-to-order sub sandwiches," says Darryl F. Bacon, vice president, food services.
The chain has also co-branded through acquisitions. As a result, approximately a dozen stores are adjacent to Blimpie and A&W quick-serve restaurants. "It's not something we're looking to expand upon," Walljasper says. "When we acquire locations, we evaluate adjacent foodservice operations to see if we want to continue with the co-brand. There are times we decide it's not in our best interest."
Casey's foodservice operations have more than proven they are strong enough to stand on their own. The kitchen equipment lineup includes a conveyor oven, a mixer, a donut fryer, three food warmers, dough rollers and two prep tables for pizza and sub production. All equipment is tested before it's purchased.
"We're looking at remodeling our existing stores to include expanded coffee stations and made-to-order subs," Bacon says. Casey's has completed 130 major store renovations, which are being evaluated for efficiency. The chain also continuously evaluates new equipment for its stores.
"Most equipment has improved over the years, such as the conveyor ovens, which offer push-button controls instead of dials," Bacon says. "The one thing we've noticed an improvement on is the dough rollers. In the past, workers would experience injuries, such as cut fingers. Now it's almost impossible to get injured on this equipment."
When purchasing equipment, ease of use, durability and warranties are critical. "Our equipment has to be user-friendly for our store operations as well as be easy to maintain at the store level," Walljasper says.
From a retail perspective, having the appropriate products available at the right times can be a big challenge. Typically, stores have items like breakfast sandwiches and pastries out from 6 to 9 a.m. Lunch offerings are featured until 2 p.m. Product is only held in warmers for an hour.
Each store has an hourly production planner who determines when and how much prepared food will be available. Business intelligence software is also utilized for this task.
"The intent is to make sure we have the right products out at the appropriate times of day to meet customer demand," Bacon says. "We want to avoid throwing product out or missing sales opportunities."
Despite the economic downturn, Casey's has been averaging about 8.5 percent same-store sales growth in foodservice over the last five years and double-digit same-store sales movement in the last few months.
"The economy has hurt the restaurant business more than it has affected us," Walljasper says. "The Midwest agricultural economy is robust, and we believe this has resulted in more consumer confidence in our demographic areas."
New additions to the foodservice program include seating in 150 stores and testing pizza delivery in six locations.
Casey's is also evaluating the expansion of its bakery offerings to include pies, cakes and more breads. "In every store — whether it's new, remodeled or acquired — we evaluate the potential of an expanded coffee bar, made-to-order sandwiches and pastries," Walljasper says.
Even though its out-of-the-way locations keep competition at bay, Casey's has built its success on making its prepared food a destination for its customers. "Our company's prepared-food operation is not just an afterthought," Walljasper says. "It's a significant part of what we do."
