Registration
Mondaq Ltd requires you to register and provide information that personally 
identifies you, including what sort of information you are interested in, for 
three primary purposes: 

To allow you to personalize the Mondaq websites you are visiting. 
  To enable features such as password reminder, newsletter alerts, email a 
  colleague, and linking from Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to your website. 
  To produce demographic feedback for our information providers who provide 
  information free for your use. 
Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) do not sell or provide your details to third 
parties other than information providers. The reason we provide our information 
providers with this information is so that they can measure the response their 
articles are receiving and provide you with information about their products and 
services.
If you do not want us to provide your name and email address you may opt out 
by clicking here .
If you do not wish to receive any future announcements of products and 
services offered by Mondaq by clicking here . 
Information Collection and Use
We require site users to register with Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to 
view the free information on the site. We also collect information from our 
users at several different points on the websites: this is so that we can 
customise the sites according to individual usage, provide 'session-aware' 
functionality, and ensure that content is acquired and developed appropriately. 
This gives us an overall picture of our user profiles, which in turn shows to 
our Editorial Contributors the type of person they are reaching by posting 
articles on Mondaq (and its affiliate sites)  meaning more free content for 
registered users. 
We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate 
sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the 
pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us 
(e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who 
author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the 
Your Profile page. We and our author organisations may only contact you via 
email or other means if you allow us to do so. Users can opt out of contact when 
they register on the site, or send an email to unsubscribe@mondaq.com with no 
disclosure in the subject heading 
Mondaq News Alerts
In order to receive Mondaq News Alerts, users have to complete a separate 
registration form. This is a personalised service where users choose regions and 
topics of interest and we send it only to those users who have requested it. 
Users can stop receiving these Alerts by going to the Mondaq News Alerts page 
and deselecting all interest areas. In the same way users can amend their 
personal preferences to add or remove subject areas. 
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a users hard drive that contains an 
identifying user number. The cookies do not contain any personal information 
about users. We use the cookie so users do not have to log in every time they 
use the service and the cookie will automatically expire if you do not visit the 
Mondaq website (or its affiliate sites) for 12 months. We also use the cookie to 
personalise a user's experience of the site (for example to show information 
specific to a user's region). As the Mondaq sites are fully personalised and 
cookies are essential to its core technology the site will function 
unpredictably with browsers that do not support cookies - or where cookies are 
disabled (in these circumstances we advise you to attempt to locate the 
information you require elsewhere on the web). However if you are concerned 
about the presence of a Mondaq cookie on your machine you can also choose to 
expire the cookie immediately (remove it) by selecting the 'Log Off' menu option 
as the last thing you do when you use the site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and we 
are not aware of any at present that do so. 
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track movement, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to personally identifiable information. 
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Mondaq (or 
its affiliate sites) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information 
requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
functionality of the site. 
Mail-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friends name and email address. Mondaq stores this 
information and may contact the friend to invite them to register with Mondaq, 
but they will not be contacted more than once. The friend may contact Mondaq to 
request the removal of this information from our database. 
Security
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected using firewalls and other security technology. If you 
have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
webmaster@mondaq.com. 
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If a users personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that users personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the Your Profile page or by sending an email to EditorialAdvisor@mondaq.com.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, we will 
post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information 
we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
How to contact Mondaq
You can contact us with comments or queries at enquiries@mondaq.com.
If for some reason you believe Mondaq Ltd. has not adhered to these 
principles, please notify us by e-mail at problems@mondaq.com and we will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report

Dollar rises from 13-month low

JPMorgan advocating for nontransparent active ETFs


                        
                        January 22, 2017 |   
                        Permalink




                        JPMorgan Chase is joining other asset managers in backing a new type of ETF mimicking active strategies keeping its investments confidential. The concept, designed by Precidian Investments, was rejected by the SEC despite support from BlackRock and Legg Mason. Precidian's ETFs would disclose stockholdings on a delay, rather than daily as traditional ETFs do. The approval of the Precidian approach, called "nontransparent" active ETFs, would pave the way for firms to repackage their mutual funds and separately managed accounts into ETFs without giving away proprietary trading strategies to potential copycats. The SEC is skeptical of allowing nontransparent products because it would be more difficult to assess the real-time value of an ETF's stockholdings if investors don't know what the fund owns.Link To Article

CFTC approves proposal to amend recordkeeping requirements

                        The CFTC unanimously approved proposed amendments to Regulation 1.31 in order to modernize and make technology-neutral the form and manner in which regulatory records must be kept, as well as rationalize the rule text for ease of understanding. The proposed amendments allow recordkeepers to leverage advances in IT as a means to reduce costs associated with the retention and production of paper and electronic records and to decrease the risks of cybersecurity threats, while also maintaining the necessary safeguards to ensure the integrity, availability and accessibility of required records. The public comment period on the proposal ends 60 days after the proposal's publication in the Federal Register.

FSB's policy recommendations target vulnerabilities in asset management industry


                        
                        January 12, 2017 |   
                        Permalink




                        The Financial Stability Board (FSB) revealed several policy recommendations aimed at addressing "liquidity mismatches across investment funds" as part of a wider paper dealing with structural vulnerabilities in the asset management sector. These include further scrutiny on whether certain asset classes are suitable for open-ended fund structures, broadening the range of risk management tools available to fund managers at times of market stress, and possibly strengthening investor disclosure on liquidity issues. In particular, the FSB recommended the IOSCO should further consider whether certain asset classes and investments are fit for inclusion within an open-ended fund structure, saying vehicles that offer daily liquidity should invest primarily in liquid assets and have strict limits on their investments in illiquid holdings. Moreover, the FSB suggested a fund's liquidity profile should be managed and adjusted on an ongoing basis to ensure its portfolio composition remains suitable in light of redemption terms and conditions, the evolution of the market environment, and investor behavior, among others.Link To Article

SEC's examination priorities for 2017 focus on protecting retail investors, market-wide risks

                        The SEC's 2017 examination priorities will focus on three areas: protecting retail investors; risks specific to the elderly and retiring investors; and market-wide risks. As part of efforts to protect retail investors, the commission's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations will examine firms that offer robo-advising and wrap fee programs that charge a single bundled fee for advisory and brokerage services, among others. A widened initiative will review investment advisers and brokers offering variable insurance products and managing target-date funds. It will also continue to focus on public pension fund managers and expand its focus on seniors and investors saving for retirement.Link To Article

DOL publishes fiduciary rule compliance guidelines for advisers, FAQs for investors


                        
                        January 11, 2017 |

Ahead of the fiduciary rule's implementation in April, the Labor Department issued a 16-page document listing suggested questions for investors to ask their advisers regarding the rule's requirements. For example, it says investors should ask whether their advisers are fiduciaries, how much they charge and whether their compensation varies depending on the investments they recommend. The department also posted a document aimed at the industry discussing several technical compliance topics that financial firms have raised in regards to the rule. Topics range from how to define investment advice in different situations and how to differentiate between advice and education.

SEC staff guidance permits brokers to charge commissions on sale of mutual fund shares

                        Staff of the SEC's Division of Investment Management released a no-action letter in response to Capital Group Companies on Jan. 11. It said the restrictions outlined in Section 22(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 do not apply to a broker "when the broker acts as agent on behalf of its customers and charges its customers commissions for effecting transactions in Clean Shares" of a registered investment company. Staff added Section 22(d) does not prohibit a principal underwriter of Clean Shares from entering into a selling agreement with a broker under these circumstances and that this position does not depend on whether the broker sells Clean Shares to investors in retirement accounts or non-retirement accounts.Link To Article

Clayton, who has represented various Wall Street firms and worked on high-profile IPOs including Alibaba Group, met with Trump on Dec. 22 and overtook former U.S. Attorney Debra Wong Yang as a potential candidate. The selection signals that the agency will try to reduce regulations that critics see as burdensome or hindering corporate growth.Link To Article
