What are analysts saying about Super Micro Computer stock?

1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Super Micro Computer, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. The Company's solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components.

Super Micro Computer, Inc. is headquartered in San Jose, California.   " (7/25/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Revenue upside indicative of strong & sustaining demand that is likely independent of temporal EPS downside. Reiterating Buy rating and 12-month price target of $43." (7/21/2017)
3. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "On Thursday, an article appeared on a tech blog highlighting a situation that arose in early 2016 between a data center customer (in this case Apple) and Super Micro. According to the article, this customer discovered what it believed was a security flaw in one of its servers provided from SMCI, returned some servers and subsequently severed its supply relationship. Given the gravity of the allegations, Super Micro published a formal response this morning. SMCI indicated that during the period in question, to the extent a security concern was raised, it was fully investigated and determined that there was 'no valid security concern' related to the Super Micro product. Why bring up this situation, which was apparently resolved and occurred over a year ago, at this time? Clearly, Apple was never a top ten customer, and with no actual issue we don't believe any disclosure would have been required nor expected. In our view, the proper response for investors is to capitalize on any downdraft that could occur from such 'reporting' and buy the dip. We reiterate our Buy and $33 target." (2/24/2017)
4. Susquehanna Bancshares Inc analysts commented, "SMCI is executing well on its Enterprise strategy, and we are encouraged with the strong Mar Q guide ahead of a meaningful product cycle in 2HCY17 as well as continued growth in its next-gen storage business." (1/27/2017)
