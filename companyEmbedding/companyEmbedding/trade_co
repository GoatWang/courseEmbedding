Philosophy

Our Own Philosophy
We believe that family is important and “Organic” is more than a trend. We   believe that farmers should earn fair wages and helping to build community   should be part of every business. We believe coffee should always taste great   and great coffee can be the vehicle to create a better world. As importers, we   see first hand where coffee comes from and feel responsible for how that coffee   arrives into the consumer market. For more than 20 years, we have been traveling   to the remote mountain areas that produce the world’s best beans. Despite many   changes within the coffee industry, we still feel it is vital to meet face to   face with our suppliers. We visit farmers and share meals and cups of coffee in   kitchens. We discuss the harvest with cooperatives, and talk about how to   strengthen business in the coming years. Often, that means providing other forms   of support such as market information, pre-finance loans, or collaborating on   development programs in education, health, infrastructure, and technical   assistance. OPTCO has been strengthening these relationships for over two   decades and is proud to stand by its producer groups and share their coffee, and   their stories with roasters and consumers around the world.
Why Organic
 We are passionate   about great tasting coffee that has been grown, harvested, milled, shipped,   roasted, and consumed in the healthiest conditions possible. By purchasing   Certified Organic coffee, we know rigorous production and processing standards   have been followed and inspected each and every year by internationally   recognized auditors that follow the strict standards set by the U.S., Canada,   and Europe. Only an Organic Certification guarantees that coffee was produced   without genetic engineering, toxic pesticides and fertilizers, or sewage sludge,   which contaminate ground water in farming communities, not to mention the coffee   itself. Organic agriculture protects environmental health and strives to improve   soils through crop rotation, cover cropping, composting, and keeping water   sources clean and free of chemicals. To learn more, visit www.organicitsworthit.org.

What's Behind the Fair Trade Movement
 Fair Trade is an alternative approach to the imbalance of   power, unstable markets, and injustices of the conventional trade system. It is   based on a partnership involving producers, exporters, importers, manufacturers,   and consumers. The Fair Trade system offers producers the security of fair   pricing during volatile markets and improved terms of trade. It also requires   producer organizations and its members to invest in their communities, follow   environmental standards, and plan for their future. Fair Trade offers consumers   a powerful way to be involved in reducing poverty through their every day   shopping, as funds that go back to coffee producers are specifically designated   for social, economic, and environmental development projects. To find out more,   please visit www.fairtrade.net or www.fairtradeusa.org.

Cafe Femenino Roaster Agreement
The Café Femenino® story is built on the hard work and initiative of women coffee farmers across the world. Their story is one of empowerment and one that we at Organic Products Trading Company seek to honor with every customer interaction and branded or co-branded piece.
Our roaster partners are crucial to the success of the Café Femenino program. To ensure mutual success, and to ensure we’re fully supporting the women farmers throughout the supply chain, we require roasters to follow a few guidelines to help us uphold the integrity of the Café Femenino program. For the full Café Femenino Roaster guidelines document, please email connie (at) optco.com.

Brand guidelines. To help eliminate guesswork and help you co-brand your materials as effectively as possible, we have developed Café Femenino brand guidelines. These guidelines detail the do’s and don’ts of using the Café Femenino brand including logo usage, approved messaging, typography, photography, web-linking, and advertising.
Donation requirements. Roaster donations are central to the impact of Café Femenino and to our unique approach as a coffee brand. We require roasters to make a minimum donation of 5 cents per pound of green coffee purchased, in one of two ways:
      
100% of the 5 cents per pound delivered directly to the Café Femenino Foundation
50% of the 5 cents per pound delivered to the Café Femenino Foundation and 50% delivered to a women’s crisis center in your community


Blending requirements. To maintain the integrity of our coffee and to ensure the women farmers are solely responsible for the coffee in each bag, Café Femenino must be presented as a single origin coffee. As such, Café Femenino may not be blended with any coffee other than another Café Femenino coffee.
Women involvement. To help us further integrate women in the coffee industry, we encourage women in your organization to do the purchasing, roasting, and marketing of the Café Femenino coffee.




Marketing Materials
We’d love for you to join the Café Femenino story. We’re proud to support our roaster partners with co-brandable marketing materials to help you connect your customers to the Café Femenino brand in an effective, consistent way. To access our suite of marketing materials, including logos, messaging, stickers, flyers, photography, regional coffee profile cards, and more, please email connie (at) optco.com.



Cafe Femenino Foundation

Café Femenino Foundation is an independent nonprofit organization that funds community betterment grant requests proposed and managed by women in coffee producing regions around the world. Foundation volunteers work throughout the year in various fundraising activities that directly support women, their families, and their communities.

OPTCO is an annual donor and proud sponsor of the Café Femenino Foundation and encourages roasters to join in that support through donations and fundraising events of their own. Learn more at CoffeeCan.org.

Featured Coffees



Mexico, Chiapas, FTO Cafe Femenino®
        Grown in the buffer zone of the El Triunfo Biosphere, this coffee is grown under strict environmental guidelines. This region was hit hard by the coffee rust outbreak, suffering losses of over 70%. By selecting seeds among locally adapted varietals, these farmers are replanting their land with rust resistant, high cup quality coffee trees. Their work is paying off: this year’s crop features a rich, nutty milk chocolate aroma with flavors of milk chocolate, cinnamon, and a brown sugar sweetness.





Sumatra, Ache, FTO Cafe Femenino®
        We are proud to bring the first all-women’s cooperative in Sumatra into the Cafe Femenino program. A sister cooperative to Permata Gayo, the women of Kokowagayo formed their own cooperative in order to have a women’s voice in how Fair Trade Premiums are spent. With less than two years under their belt, they have already created early childhood education centers and conducted leadership training for women. Their coffee has all the earthiness of a bold Sumatran coffee, with added sweetness of vanilla and cherry.

Fair Trade Certifications

The Fair Trade mission is to connect disadvantaged producers with consumers, promote fairer trading conditions and empower producers to combat poverty. Rather than creating dependency on aid, Fair Trade uses a market-based approach that works with farmers to get a fair price for their harvest while requiring safe working conditions and a decent living wage for workers. Fair Trade also requires producers to follow environmental standards that help protect and improve the ecosystems they live and work in. There is a set minimum price that ensures producers can cover costs of production. It acts as a safety net for farmers at times when world markets fall below a sustainable level. Additionally, a premium is paid on top of the regular market price that goes into a general fund which workers and farmers democratically decide to use towards improving various aspects of their community. OPTCO has been an active collaborator in the Fair Trade movement within the United States since its early stages. We have been a registered importer of Certified Fair Trade Coffee since 1998 and currently registered with both Fair Trade USA and Fairtrade Canada.



Small Producer's Symbol
The Small Producer’s Symbol (or Símbolo de Pequeños Productores, SPP) is   a global initiative launched in 2006 by the Latin American and Caribbean Network of   Small Fair Trade Producers (CLAC). This program is unique in that it is wholly   owned, operated and governed by small producer organizations. As well as   coffee, the 'Símbolo' certifies a wide variety of other high quality   products that come directly from small farmers. The SPP logo represents the   values and mission of this new system: balance and unity between producers and   consumers, men and women, a healthy environment and a dignified standard of   living. OPTCO registered as a SPP importer in 2012 and is proud to have been the   first importer to bring SPP coffee into North America.



Rainforest Alliance CertifiedTM
The Rainforest   Alliance works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods by   transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior. The   Rainforest Alliance helps farmers, forest managers and tourism businesses realize greater   economic benefits by ensuring ecosystems within and around their operations are   protected, that workers are well-trained, have safe working conditions,   proper sanitation, health care and housing. OPTCO has been a registered   trader/handler of Rainforest Alliance CertifiedTM coffees since 2010.


Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center "Bird Friendly"
SMBC Certification has an exclusive focus on understanding and protecting migratory birds and their habitat throughout the Western Hemisphere. Money generated by the sale of SMBC "Bird Friendly®" coffee plays a key role in the   conservation of the global environment and of migratory birds that find sanctuary in forests along the Americas. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center takes an active approach in research, education, training, and policy work to push for shade-grown coffee production. OPTCO has been a buyer of SMBC-Bird Friendly coffee for more than 15 years.

Quality

Coffee quality starts at origin
Our producing partners are more   knowledgeable about cup quality than ever before. While most farmers and   cooperatives have long established QC systems throughout the production stage   (harvesting, processing, and sorting) fewer have been set up to fully evaluate   coffee in a cupping lab. Despite   massive exports, many coffee producers do not have a strong coffee consumer   culture within their own society and even less, a discerning coffee   palette.   However, as producers have more access to information, partnerships, and   constructive discussion with buyers, they are acquiring additional tools to   improve their quality analysis all the way to the cup. Many producer groups are   also investing resources in cupping facilities and training for lab technicians.   To assist in this development OPTCO organizes training sessions, roasters   visits, and covers travel costs to trade shows on top of establishing regular   feedback and dialogue about coffee quality throughout the harvest. This means a   clearer understanding about quality between everyone along the coffee chain and   pushes all of us to supply the best product possible.

Into the Market
The OPTCO cupping team has been evaluating   every coffee that comes into our lab since 1990. A supplier sends us a   pre-shipment sample that we analyze at different roast levels to accurately   detect any defects or anomalies, as well as the more specialized nuances of the   specific origin. We repeat the evaluation process with an arrival sample once   the shipment lands. This protocol allows us to stand by the quality of our   product, provide clear feedback to producers, and help match the right coffee   with each roaster’s desired profile. Our goal is to supply our customers with   the best specialty coffee that fits perfectly into their line-up.

Trading company

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Trading companies are businesses working with different kinds of products which are sold for consumer, business or government purposes. Trading companies buy a specialized range of products, maintain a stock or a shop, and deliver products to customers.
Different kinds of practical conditions make for many kinds of business. Usually two kinds of businesses are defined in trading. Importers or wholesalers maintain a stock and deliver products to shops or large end customers. They work in a large geographical area, while their customers, the shops, work in smaller areas and often in just a small neighbourhood.
When talking about "trading companies", today we refer mainly to global B2B traders, highly specialized in one goods category and with a strong logistic organization.
Changes in practical conditions such as faster distribution, computing and modern marketing have led to changes in their business models.
The Winding-up and Restructuring Act, an act of the Parliament of Canada, uses the following definition"

“trading company” means any company, except a railway or telegraph company, carrying on business similar to that carried on by apothecaries, auctioneers, bankers, brokers, brickmakers, builders, carpenters, carriers, cattle or sheep salesmen, coach proprietors, dyers, fullers, keepers of inns, taverns, hotels, saloons or coffee houses, lime burners, livery stable keepers, market gardeners, millers, miners, packers, printers, quarrymen, sharebrokers, ship-owners, shipwrights, stockbrokers, stock-jobbers, victuallers, warehousemen, wharfingers, persons using the trade of merchandise by way of bargaining, exchange, bartering, commission, consignment or otherwise, in gross or by retail, or by persons who, either for themselves, or as agents or factors for others, seek their living by buying and selling or buying and letting for hire goods or commodities, or by the manufacture, workmanship or the conversion of goods or commodities or trees;[1]

Japan has a special class of "general trading companies" (sogo shosha), large and highly diversified businesses that trade in a wide range of goods and services. Trading Companies are mostly b2b business services and they trade by other companies invested money and takes commission.

Case Study #1: 171 Point Increase for Detarius













Adding 1 tradeline to your credit history already has a huge impact on your credit score. Detarius wanted $50,000 in credit so he could enjoy life a little more.Before working with Top Tradelines, his credit scores were 660 (Equifax), 663 (TransUnion) and 683 (Experian).


After adding just one seasoned tradeline to his credit history, his credit scores improved to 721 on Equifax and 728 for both Experian and TransUnion. 








Case Study # 2: 183 Point Increase for Harvey




Harvey from Augusta, GA is another of our happy clients who found success in increasing his credit score by adding seasoned tradelines to his credit report. He needed $25,000 for his kid's college but wasn't sure whether he will be approved based on his credit report. 


He found Top Tradelines and purchased the bronze package. In less than 30 days after the tradelines were added, his credit score improved to 765  (Experian), 748  (TransUnion) and 702  (Equifax). His credit score improved right before all tradelines were posted.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

3

Application filing
Your completed application will be filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).











Why get a trademark?
Most of the brands, logos and slogans you love, know and trust have been registered. A registered mark gives you a presumption of ownership and a presumed right to use the brand nationwide giving you broader protection in courts. Once registered, present yourself as an established and serious business with the ® symbol after your name, logo or slogan. Other benefits include:

 Presumed validity of the mark if you have to sue
 Additional remedies in court
 May increase the value of your company









Why run a search for similar marks?
Before spending your time and money filing an application, you should do a search to see if your mark is already in use or registered by someone else.  A search will help avoid obvious duplications of pre-existing marks. If the USPTO rejects your application, the fees to  Trademark Engine and the USPTO are not refundable. If your company is just beginning, it’s better to make name changes now rather than invest in building a brand only to learn that you have to change the name and lose all of your goodwill. All packages include a free, federal direct-hit search.

 What is a trademark and why do I need it?
									





A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others another party. A “service” mark distinguishes the source of a service, rather than a good, but the two are typically simply referred to as a “trademark” or “mark”. In more general terms, getting a trademark protects your brand.  Most of the brands, logos and slogans you love, know and trust have been properly registered.
									By registering your trademark, you will be entitled to a presumption of ownership of the brand on a national level and a presumed right to use the brand nationwide. It prevents someone from registering a confusingly similar mark after you and allows you to sue in federal court if someone infringes on the brand you have worked hard to build.  Once registered, you can also present yourself as an established and serious business because you can start using the ® symbol after your name, logo or slogan.
After you properly register the mark and use it for a five-year period, Trademark Engine can also help you file a “Declaration of Incontestability” giving you the greatest protection under U.S. trademark law. This will prevent others from contesting your trademark on grounds often subject to attack such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is confusingly similar to another mark that someone else that began using before you; or (3) the mark is simply functional as opposed to identifying the source of the goods or services.  
You can use special modifiers (like ‘in:’, ‘from:’, etc.) to focus results based on a channel, person, or date. Results can be filtered by recency, relevancy, and file type so you can easily find what you need.






 What is a common law trademark and why do I need to register my mark?
									





Under U.S. law, you do establish what is known as “common law” when you use your name, logo or slogan in commerce even if you do not register it.   So, why pay to register your trademark? Common law rights are limited to the geographic area where you actually use the mark as opposed to nationwide protection given to you when you register your mark. Without registration, you can be limited to using your mark geographically and not have the ability to expand.  Likewise, if someone else is already using your mark in a limited geographic area, you can box them in by registering your mark.  Plus, should you ever have to sue someone for trademark infringement, your registration gives you a leg up in court as to the validity of your mark and your date of usage.  There are also remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, when you let Trademark Engine file your trademark, once accepted, you will be on the USPTO database which discourages others from using your mark in the future.  Future companies will know your mark is already spoken for and hopefully you can avoid any disputes.
Benefits to registering your mark:

Nationwide protection
Presumed validity of the mark if you have to sue
Additional remedies in court
May increase the value of your company
Registration with the USPTO will discourage others from trying to use your mark







 Why trademark a name or logo?
									





If budget is not an issue, the answer is register them both.  If you need to choose, then, generally speaking, you should start with your name. To the extent someone is going to use something of yours, it is more likely they will try to use your name.  Protecting your name gives you the broadest protection because it prevents any use of it that is causes confusion, even if they  someone tries try to use your name within their logo.  To protect your name, you protect it as a “standard character mark” without any notation as to the font, coloring or any styling.
A mark for your logo protects the exact shape, orientation, stylization and sometimes color in that particular logo.  The company name can, but does not have to be part of the logo.  Registering it the logo protects the logo it and prevents others from using that logo it or something confusingly similar to the logo. If you change your logo, and want that protected, too, you will have to file a new application.  You are much more likely to change your logo, than your name.
To give you an example of a registered logo dispute, ExxonMobil filed suit against Fox for their use of the FXX Network logo because of the interlocking X’s.
The case settled right before trial. 

									If within your budget, you get the maximum protection when your register both your name and your logo.  Each filing requires its own filing fees per class and fees to Trademark Engine.






 I have my domain, so why do I need a trademark?
									





Much like the availability of a corporate name in your state does not mean you have superior trademark rights to use the name in commerce, the availability of the domain name is not an indication either.  A company could have a trademark name on a product or service, but not have acquired the domain name.
The availability of the domain name should be one part of a comprehensive search, which Trademark Engine can perform for you, to determine the strength of your brand name or slogan and the likelihood of succeeding in trademarking on the domain name.
If you have been using a domain name as part of a brand that sells goods or services, you may have established common law trademark rights.  Under U.S. law, you do establish what is known as “common law” when you use your name, logo or slogan in commerce even if you do not register it.  Common law rights are limited to the geographic area where you actually use the mark as opposed to nationwide protection given to you when you register your mark.
Without registration, you can be limited to using your mark geographically and not have the ability to expand.  Likewise, if someone else is already using your mark in a limited geographic area, you can box them in by registering your mark.  Plus, should you ever have to sue someone for trademark infringement, your registration gives you a leg up in court as to the validity of your mark and your date of usage.  There are also remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, when you let Trademark Engine file your trademark, once accepted, you will be on the USPTO database which discourages others from using your mark.  Future companies will know your mark is already spoken for and hopefully you can avoid any disputes. 






 What about my slogan, do I register that?
									





When you are investing heavily in a marketing campaign with a slogan, you should consider registering your slogan as well. You can also register short catch phrases or sayings when you are selling them as part of merchandise like shirts or hats.  The same rules apply that are applicable to picking your company name. Namely, the slogan should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary meaning. In other words, you probably can’t protect “really good pizza” unless that saying has become so famous that most consumers associate it with a certain pizza brand.






 What information will I need?
									





The whole process will take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.  For a typical application, be prepared to provide at least the following:

The actual mark you want to use.
Be prepared to disclaim any part of the mark that may, on its own, not be registrable. Read more here.
The full legal name and address of the owner of the mark.
A copy of the specimen which is an example that shows you are using the mark in commerce.  This could be a picture of your product or a website advertising your service.
The International Class you plan to use, which are listed here and on a drop down menu in our system, and a description of your good and services.
The date you first used the mark in commerce and the date you first shared the mark anywhere.

Even if you are the first to use a name, you need to be strategic. Think of the name as a sliding scale between not able to trademark it and easily able to trademark it. On the left side of the spectrum (or the not trademarkable side) are generic names. For example, you could not trademark the name “The Screwdriver Company” if you made screwdrivers.  Likewise, we could not name this service “Online Trademark Filing Company” and get a trademark registration. 
Almost as problematic as generic names are merely descriptive names.  Hence, “The Strong Screwdriver Company” is also not likely to pass muster with the USPTO.   Descriptive marks are only entitled to trademark protection if they have gained secondary meaning. That is a legal term of art that means they have become so famous that despite the generic nature, the public associates the product with a specific company.  Examples include American Airlines or General Motors. If you aren’t that famous, you should not rely upon a secondary meaning to get your generic name through. If you are that famous, you likely have an army of lawyers. Geographic names often run into trouble and are considered descriptive. “Southwest Screwdrivers” is likely to run into a challenge. Of course, Southwest Airlines has become famous enough to have a secondary meaning.  
After descriptive and generic names, your chances of being able to register a name starts to improve dramatically. The next on that scale is the suggestive mark.  These hint at the quality or another aspect of the company such as “Herculean Screwdriver Company.”  It is better than “Strong Screwdriver,” but conveys the same meaning.  These you can usually register, but you run the risk that the USPTO says what you thought was suggestive was actually descriptive.  Some popular examples include Microsoft which makes software for microcomputers or Citibank for financial services.  Brand owners often like these names because it gives the consumer a good idea of what the company does without having to educate them or spending a lot on advertising to get them used to the name for the particular product or service.
Next on the list are arbitrary marks.  These are existing words used in a way unrelated to their normal everyday meanings.  Hence, Chocolate Screwdrivers may work. The textbook example of the arbitrary mark is Apple Computers - not to be confused with Apple Records.  
Finally, fanciful marks are the easiest to get through the USPTO.  A fanciful mark is a made up word or a very rarely used word that has nothing to do with describing the products.  “Glotz” for a screwdriver company may work.  You are likely familiar with Yahoo!, Google, Exxon and Spotify which would all be considered fanciful marks.  
The USPTO may reject your name because it is similar to another name already registered.  That is why you should run a search before you file because if the USPTO rejects your application, the fees to Trademark Engine and the USPTO are not refundable. In addition to being too similar to another name, the mark may be rejected because it is a surname, it is geographically descriptive of where you are doing business, is disparaging (think of the current challenge to the Washington Redskins football team), it is a foreign term that translates to a generic or descriptive english term, it uses an individual’s name or likeness, or is the title of a single book or movie. 








Allow Trademark Engine to assist you with your comprehensive trademark search.
In the most general sense, getting a registered trademark protects your brand. By registering a trademark with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), you will be entitled to a presumption of ownership of the brand and business name on a national level and a presumed right to use it nationwide. It prevents someone from registering a confusingly similar trademark after you and allows you to sue in federal court if someone infringes on the brand you have worked hard to build. Once you file a trademark application and register a trademark, you can present yourself as an established and serious business because you can start using the ® symbol after your name, logo or slogan. We can help you through this process by assisting you with your trademark application. The process begins with us performing a trademark search and then creating and filing your trademark application with the USPTO. The federal trademark registration process has never been so easy.
