about | Steven Overman




























Toggle navigation

















Steven Overman has built his career as a pioneer at the intersection of media communication and technology innovation for over two decades. He works on the front line of business and culture transformation, helping teams expand new ideas into massive international phenomena that generate billions of dollars of economic value, but even more importantly, new ideas that positively change the lives of people everywhere.
Overman recently joined Kodak as Chief Marketing Officer, where he will lead the renewal of one of the world’s biggest brands. As a strategy and innovation consultant for startups as well as Fortune 100 companies, and during his tenure as Vice President of Global Brand and Marketing Creation for Nokia Corporation, Overman has directly engaged with a broad range of leaders from the C-suite to the product and software design studio. He has collaborated with the world’s leading creative studios and advertising agencies, imagined and evangelized concepts for sustainable hospitality and sustainability infrastructure for international brands and co-created award-winning youth marketing in countries and cultures around.


Overman was one of the earliest members of the group that created and spread the message of the Digital Revolution at Wired magazine, and collaborated on the invention of the ad banner for the world’s first commercial website Hotwired (an early offshoot of Wired). He helped create the Academy Award-winning movie Philadelphia, which transformed the global conversation about HIV/AIDS. He led the international launch of the world’s first smartphone, the blockbuster Nokia N95, and went on to lead the creation of innovative marketing for a whole new category of affordable mobile technology that connected a billion new consumers to the Internet, from India to Indonesia to Sub-Saharan Africa.
Overman is a frequent public speaker at industry events, ranging from NorthZone Ventures CEO Summit, Cannes Lions and EuroBest Festival of Creativity, Yahoo Mobile Senior Leaders Summit and Nokia World, to the Conference Board, SIME Technology Conferences, PSFK and other international thought leadership events. He has been quoted in Wired, Marketing Week, Fast Company and Business 2.0.

THE CONSCIENCE ECONOMY

                HOW A MASS MOVEMENT FOR GOOD
                IS GREAT FOR BUSINESS
            






"This lucid business guide persuasively argues that businesses, like it or not, will have to make fundamental changes in how they operate in the decades to come." 
Publishers Weekly, Oct. 2014


“Steven is one of the best speakers I have seen speak. Not only is his quality of thinking at the highest strategic level but his delivery is just as powerful. He speaks with humility, humour and has an uncanny ability to sew together disparate themes of business and human understandings into a clear narrative. A knock out personality who left us all thinking differently.” 
Ruth Nye, Account Director at The Good Relations Group


“The Conscience Economy has arrived at precisely the right moment. In a period suffused with entirely too much unjustified pessimism spread by legacy media that make money fostering mass anxiety, The Conscience Economy is a refreshing blast of unabashed optimism, complete with a scenario for a utopian future.”
Louis Rossetto, Co-founder, Wired


“Overman maps out an insightful and provocative playbook for businesses looking to make an impact and succeed in the hyperconnected culture of tomorrow.”
David Fanger, SVP Moody’s Investors Service


“I love the energy of The Conscience Economy and the inevitable truths that Overman so masterfully weaves into every page.“
Alex Willcock, CEO, VisualDNA
