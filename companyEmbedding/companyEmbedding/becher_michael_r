About this book




This book, written by leading experts in the field, is a comprehensive guide to the best available techniques in Achilles tendon surgery. Each surgical procedure is described step by step, covering all of the approaches employed for the most common and important Achilles tendon pathologies. The clear descriptions are complemented by superb drawings prepared by a medical artist on the basis of photographs supplied by the authors. Pearls and possible pitfalls are identified to ensure optimal outcomes for patients. The book is the outcome of a collaboration among international Achilles tendon experts – the Achilles Tendon Study Group – that has already resulted in four other books on current concepts relating to the Achilles tendon. Like these previous volumes, The Achilles Tendon – An Atlas of Surgical Procedures is based on the highest level of evidence and expertise. It will be invaluable for orthopaedic surgeons, trauma surgeons, and residents, assisting them in their daily clinical work.
