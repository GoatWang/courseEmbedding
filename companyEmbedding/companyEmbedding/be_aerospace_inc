Since its founding as Collins Radio in 1933, Rockwell Collins and its products have been recognized for distinctive quality and state-of-the-art technology. Collins Radio Company, founded by Arthur Collins in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, initially designed and produced short wave radio equipment. The company steadily grew, and captured the world's attention when Collins supplied the equipment to establish a communications link with the South Pole expedition of Rear Admiral Richard Byrd in 1933.
During the next three decades, Collins continued to expand its work in all phases of the communications field while broadening its technology thrust into numerous other disciplines. New developments such as flight control instruments, radio communication devices and satellite voice transmissions created great opportunities in the marketplace. Collins Radio Company provided communications in America's space program, including equipment for astronauts to communicate with earth stations and equipment to track and communicate with spacecraft. Collins communications equipment was used for the Apollo, Gemini and Mercury programs, providing voice communication for every American astronaut traveling through space. In 1973, the U.S. Skylab Program used Collins equipment to provide communication from the astronauts to earth.
When the company experienced financial difficulties in 1973, Rockwell International, a diversified high-technology company, acquired Collins Radio Company. The company further strengthened the focus on aviation electronics in May 1998 when Rockwell Collins exited the Precision Agriculture and Integrated Local Government business and sold the Railroad Electronics business to Westinghouse Air Brake Company. On June 29, 2001, Rockwell Collins, Inc. was spun-off from Rockwell International and began trading its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COL." Today, Rockwell Collins, Inc. designs, produces, markets and supports electronic communications, avionics and in-flight entertainment systems for commercial, military and government customers worldwide.
Rockwell Collins-brand aircraft electronics are installed in the cockpits of nearly every airline in the world and its communication systems transmit nearly 70 percent of U.S. and allied military airborne communications.

B/E Aerospace, Inc. is a manufacturer of aircraft passenger cabin interior products for the commercial and business jet aircraft markets. B/E Aerospace has leading worldwide market shares in all of its major product lines and serves virtually all of the world's airlines, aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies through its direct global sales and customer support organizations.[citation needed] Based in Wellington, Florida,[5] the company was capitalized as a $4.2 billion corporation as of January 2016.[6]

History[edit]
Founded by Amin Khoury in 1987, B/E Aerospace has evolved from a $3 million company to $2.6 billion in revenue,[7] making it the world’s leading manufacturer of aircraft interior products and solutions for the commercial, business jet, and military markets. B/E’s history has been one of multiple acquisitions coupled with strong internal growth.[8]
On June 1, 2005, Air Canada awarded a $50-million (U.S.) contract to Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., to upgrade seating in 143 aircraft.[9]
In 2012, B/E's ALCI division became the sole source for all future lavatories on new build Boeing 737 aircraft. Introducing their patented Spacewall lavatory, airlines can take advantage of space provided to add up to 6 passenger seats per aircraft. Delta Air Lines was the launch customer, with the first aircraft delivery on 9/27/2013.
In December 2014, B/E announced that it had completed the spin-off of its aerospace fasteners and consumables business, creating KLX, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLXI).[10]
B/E Aerospace was bought in April 2017[11] for $6.4 billion by the avionics and aircraft connectivity provider Rockwell Collins based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which competes with Honeywell and more recently with Garmin. B/E shareholders would own 20% of the new Rockwell which would have $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.[12]
Products[edit]
The company is a major provider of airline seats to many airlines worldwide. Some significant customers include United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Customers using the company's most popular product - Diamond Business Class Seat, include Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air China, American Airlines, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, United Airlines and Virgin Australia. Some of B/E Aerospace's rivals in the airline seating industry include Acro Aircraft Seating in the UK, Zodiac Seats U.S. in Gainesville, Texas, Zodiac Seats France, STELIA Sogerma Seats in France, Geven in Italy, Recaro in Germany, and Aviointeriors in Italy.
In the Business Jet Seating segment, B/E Aerospace's main competitors are United Technologies Corporation's Decrane Aircraft Seating in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, Iacobucci in Italy, and PAC Seating Systems in Palm City, Florida.
B/E Aerospace also manufactures beverage makers, ovens, oxygen systems, lavatories and interior lighting for commercial aircraft and business jets.[13] B/E Aerospace's Interior Structures division based in Leighton Buzzard UK, manufactures and supplies galley monuments for the Airbus A350.
Oxygen Systems[edit]
The FAA announced on 11 August 2008 that it would investigate why "almost half the masks either did not deploy or failed to provide oxygen" during a pan-pan event on American Airlines Flight 31[14] The FAA had recently issued airworthiness directives regarding problems with defective inline flow indicators obstructing the BE Aerospace oxygen masks on several Boeing commercial aircraft models. B/E had identified a repair in February 2006. Boeing then issued a "Special Attention Service Bulletin" to inspect and if necessary repair the masks in April 2007. The directives only require action by April 2013 unless already done.[15]
Acquisition by Rockwell Collins[edit]
Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer and supplier of aviation and integrated solutions for both commercial and government applications, filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace before the Philippine Competition Commission since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.[16]
As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.[16]

Founded by Amin Khoury in 1987, B/E Aerospace has evolved from a $3 million company to $2.6 billion in revenue,[7] making it the world’s leading manufacturer of aircraft interior products and solutions for the commercial, business jet, and military markets. B/E’s history has been one of multiple acquisitions coupled with strong internal growth.[8]
On June 1, 2005, Air Canada awarded a $50-million (U.S.) contract to Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., to upgrade seating in 143 aircraft.[9]
In 2012, B/E's ALCI division became the sole source for all future lavatories on new build Boeing 737 aircraft. Introducing their patented Spacewall lavatory, airlines can take advantage of space provided to add up to 6 passenger seats per aircraft. Delta Air Lines was the launch customer, with the first aircraft delivery on 9/27/2013.
In December 2014, B/E announced that it had completed the spin-off of its aerospace fasteners and consumables business, creating KLX, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLXI).[10]
B/E Aerospace was bought in April 2017[11] for $6.4 billion by the avionics and aircraft connectivity provider Rockwell Collins based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which competes with Honeywell and more recently with Garmin. B/E shareholders would own 20% of the new Rockwell which would have $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.[12]
Products[edit]
The company is a major provider of airline seats to many airlines worldwide. Some significant customers include United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Customers using the company's most popular product - Diamond Business Class Seat, include Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air China, American Airlines, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, United Airlines and Virgin Australia. Some of B/E Aerospace's rivals in the airline seating industry include Acro Aircraft Seating in the UK, Zodiac Seats U.S. in Gainesville, Texas, Zodiac Seats France, STELIA Sogerma Seats in France, Geven in Italy, Recaro in Germany, and Aviointeriors in Italy.
In the Business Jet Seating segment, B/E Aerospace's main competitors are United Technologies Corporation's Decrane Aircraft Seating in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, Iacobucci in Italy, and PAC Seating Systems in Palm City, Florida.
B/E Aerospace also manufactures beverage makers, ovens, oxygen systems, lavatories and interior lighting for commercial aircraft and business jets.[13] B/E Aerospace's Interior Structures division based in Leighton Buzzard UK, manufactures and supplies galley monuments for the Airbus A350.
Oxygen Systems[edit]
The FAA announced on 11 August 2008 that it would investigate why "almost half the masks either did not deploy or failed to provide oxygen" during a pan-pan event on American Airlines Flight 31[14] The FAA had recently issued airworthiness directives regarding problems with defective inline flow indicators obstructing the BE Aerospace oxygen masks on several Boeing commercial aircraft models. B/E had identified a repair in February 2006. Boeing then issued a "Special Attention Service Bulletin" to inspect and if necessary repair the masks in April 2007. The directives only require action by April 2013 unless already done.[15]
Acquisition by Rockwell Collins[edit]
Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer and supplier of aviation and integrated solutions for both commercial and government applications, filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace before the Philippine Competition Commission since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.[16]
As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.[16]

B/E Aerospace (NDAQ:BEAV)

















B/E Aerospace (NDAQ:BEAV) | Products & Business Segments





According to B/E Aerospace, it is the world's largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and for business jets.
The company sells its products and services directly to virtually all of the world's major airlines and aerospace manufacturers. 

Since its organization as a corporation in Delaware in 1987, B/E Aerospace has substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of its business 
as a result of a number of acquisitions. Between 1989 and 2006, B/E completed 28 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. 
These acquisitions enabled B/E to position itself as a preferred global supplier to the company's customers. 
During this period, B/E consolidated facilities and product lines, implemented lean manufacturing and continuous improvement programs 
and invested in IT. All of these efforts allowed the company to continually improve its productivity and expand its operating margins. 
In 2008, B/E completed the acquisition of the consumables solutions distribution business (HCS) from Honeywell International Inc.
for the purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. The combination of HCS with B/E's existing consumables products business 
created the world's leading distributor of aerospace fasteners and consumables.  
In October 2010, B/E acquired TSI Group, Inc. (TSI) and the aerospace fastener distribution business of Satair A/S (Satair) 
for a net purchase price of approximately $307 million and $162 million, respectively. TSI is a market leader in the design, 
engineering and manufacturing of customized, fully integrated, thermal management and interconnect solutions that address 
complex power management requirements of a broad range of customers in the aerospace and defense industries. 
TSI is included as a component of B/E's commercial aircraft segment. Satair is a distributor of consumables to European and Asia Pacific 
aerospace manufacturers and their suppliers and is included as a component of B/E's consumables management segment. 
On January 30, 2012, B/E acquired UFC Aerospace Corp. (UFC), a leading provider of complex supply chain management and inventory logistics solutions, 
for approximately $405 million in cash.
In July 2012, B/E acquired 100% of Interturbine Aviation Logistics GmbH, Interturbine Logistics Solutions GmbH, and Interturbine Technologies GmbH, 
a provider of material management logistical services to global airlines and maintenance, 
repair and overhaul providers (MROs), for a net purchase price of approximately $245 million. 
UFC and Interturbine are included as components of the company's Consumables Management segment.

In June 2014, B/E acquired the outstanding shares of the Emteq, Inc. group of companies, a domestic provider of aircraft interior and exterior lighting systems, 
as well as aircraft cabin management and power systems for a purchase price of $253.2 million, net of cash acquired. 
The company also acquired the outstanding shares of the F+E Fischer + Entwicklungen GmbH & Co. KG group of companies, 
a leading Europe-based manufacturer of seating products for civilian helicopters for a purchase price of $211.7 million, net of cash acquired. 
The Company also acquired the outstanding shares of Wessex Advanced Switching Products Ltd., a company engaged in the production of lighting, 
control units and switches, based in Europe for a purchase price of $63.0 million, net of cash acquired. 
These acquisitions are included in the business jet segment.

On December 16, 2014, B/E completed the spin-off of KLX Inc. by means of the transfer of its Consumables Management segment.
B/E retained its Commercial Aircraft and Business Jet segments.


B/E Aerospace is headquartered in Wellington, Florida and incorporated in Delaware.

B/E Aerospace operates through two principal business segments:


	• Commercial Aircraft
	• Business Jet.


The following table highlights B/E's sales from 2013 to 2015 by segment:


A description of the business of each of the company's segments is set forth below.



Commercial Aircraft
Go to Top!

In 2015, B/E's Commercial Aircraft segment generated revenues of $2,098 million compared to $2,059 million and $1,785 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In 2015, this segment accounted for 77% of total sales. B/E estimates that, as of December 31, 2015, it had an aggregate installed base of products produced 
by its commercial aircraft segment, valued at replacement prices, of approximately $10.4 billion.

     Financial results for BE's Commercial Aircraft segment were as follows:



In the following, the products and services of B/E's Commercial Aircraft segment are presented.

Seating products
According to B/E, it is the world's leading manufacturer of aircraft seats, offering a wide selection of first class, 
business class, tourist class and regional aircraft seats. A typical seat manufactured and sold by B/E includes the seat frame, 
cushions, armrests, tray table and a variety of optional features such as adjustable lumbar supports, electrical actuation systems, 
footrests, reading lights, head/neck supports, and other comfort amenities. B/E also integrates a wide variety of in-flight entertainment 
equipment into its seats, which is supplied by customers or third-party suppliers.

First and Business Class Seats: B/E's line of first class lie-flat seats incorporates full electric actuation, 
an electric ottoman, privacy panels and sidewall-mounted tables. B/E leverages its differentiated expertise in executive seating, 
divans, cabinetry, lighting, environmental controls and reliable use of exotic materials to develop these exclusive environments. 
B/E's business class seats incorporate features developed over 25 years of seating design. B/E has led this sector of the industry 
since the development and delivery of the industry's first mass produced lie flat seat in 2001. B/E offers the widest array of business class 
platforms in the industry to support airlines' differing requirements for business class zone density. The business class seats include 
electrical or mechanical actuation, PC power ports, personal entertainment device connectivity, gaming headsets, individual video monitors, 
leg rests, adjustable lumbar cushions, four and six-way adjustable headrests and fiber optic reading and accent lights. The first and business class 
products are substantially more expensive than tourist class seats due to these luxury accoutrements. B/E's deep understanding of airframe 
and system interfaces and ability to certify these suites and cabins within required lead-times, supports the company's market design 
and manufacturing capabilities.
Tourist Class and Regional Jet Seats: According to B/E, its Pinnacle® coach class seat has become the industry's most popular seat platform 
for single-aisle aircraft since its launch in late 2009. According to the company, the seat improves comfort and offers significantly improved 
passenger living space as well as benefiting the airlines with simplified maintenance and spare parts purchasing. Pinnacle® was engineered 
for use across the entire single-aisle aircraft fleet. In 2015, B/E introduced its new patented Meridian® main cabin seating platform, 
which is the industry's lightest full-featured seat. The Meridian® seat platform utilizes advanced proprietary technologies that significantly reduce 
cost of ownership, simplify maintenance and increase overall passenger living space and comfort. Since its launch, the Meridian® has received launch orders 
in excess of 550 aircraft.

Spares: Aircraft seats require regularly scheduled maintenance in the course of normal passenger use. Airlines depend on seat manufacturers 
and secondary suppliers to provide spare parts and kit upgrade programs.

Food and Beverage and Preparation and Storage Equipment
According to B/E, it is the leading manufacturer of aircraft coffee and beverage makers. B/E manufactures a broad line of coffee makers, 
including the Essence® line of beverage makers, coffee warmers and water boilers. The company also manufactures a cappuccino/espresso maker. 
B/E is also the leading manufacturer of a broad line of specialized ovens, including high efficiency convection ovens, steam ovens and warming ovens.
The company's DS Steam Oven uses a method of preparing in-flight food by maintaining constant temperature and moisture in the food. 
The DS Steam Oven addresses airlines' need to provide a wider range of food offerings than can be prepared by convection ovens. 
According to B/E, it is also the worldwide industry leader in the design, manufacture and supply of commercial aircraft refrigeration equipment. 
The company manufactures self-contained wine and beverage chillers, refrigerators/freezers and galley air chilling systems.

Oxygen Delivery Systems
According to B/E Aerospace, it is the leading manufacturer of oxygen storage, distribution 
and delivery systems for both commercial and business jet aircraft. B/E has the capability to both produce all required components 
and to fully integrate overhead passenger service units with either chemical or gaseous oxygen equipment. B/E's oxygen equipment has been approved 
for use on all Boeing and Airbus aircraft and is also found on essentially all general aviation and VIP aircraft. 
The Boeing 787 was the first aircraft equipped with a passenger oxygen system using B/E's advanced Pulse Oxygen and passenger service unit technology. 
Boeing has awarded the company a sole source contract for the installation of the Pulse Oxygen™ system on its new 777X platform. 
The company also provides similar technology for passenger and crew oxygen systems for the A350. B/E has also been selected by both Boeing and Airbus 
to provide installed lavatory oxygen as their preferred line-fit solution for all platforms.

Interior Structures
B/E's modular lavatory system utilizes the company's patented Spacewall® technology, which frees up floor space in the cabin, 
creating the opportunity to add up to six incremental passenger seats on each airplane. The modular lavatory systems integrate B/E's 
Aircraft Ecosystems® vacuum toilet, long-life LED lighting and tamper proof state-of-the-art lavatory oxygen system. According to the company,
Aircraft Ecosystems® vacuum toilets have 25% greater reliability than existing systems and allow components to be replaced in a few minutes, 
as compared to up to an hour for existing systems. B/E's modular lavatory system has become standard equipment on all Boeing 737s, 
as well as the 737 MAX which enters service in 2017. Retrofit demand for B/E's lavatory systems could be substantial.
B/E has also entered the vacuum wastewater system market. The company's vacuum wastewater system incorporates a proprietary design 
which eliminates the primary cause of failure which plagues other vacuum systems. In addition, B/E's systems include 
components and systems that will significantly lower the overall cost of ownership, simplify maintenance and improve lavatory hygiene. 
B/E's modular approach to the design of galley systems allows airlines to select galley positions and configurations for their specific 
operational needs, while minimizing total aircraft system weight. B/E also provides next generation galley systems 
for the Airbus A350, which is designed to accommodate "flex zones" allowing airlines to select from a wide range of galley configurations.

Engineering, Design, Integration, Installation and Certification Services
According to B/E Aerospace, it is a leading supplier of engineering, design, integration, installation and certification services 
for commercial aircraft passenger cabin interiors. B/E also offers in-house capabilities to design, manage, integrate, test and certify 
reconfigurations and modifications for commercial aircraft and to manufacture related products, including engineering kits and interface components. 
B/E provides a broad range of interior reconfiguration services which enable airlines to modify the cabin layout, install telecommunications 
and entertainment equipment, and relocate galleys, lavatories, overhead bins, and crew rest compartments. The expertise and resources 
of B/E's engineering and certifications unit is embedded in the company's major interiors densification campaigns, new cabin systems 
and product developments. The ability to leverage its knowledge of the aircraft electrical, environmental and stress environments 
allows B/E to optimize platform development to comply with challenging manufacturing and certification requirements.



Business Jet
Go to Top!

In 2015, B/E's Business Jet segment generated revenues of $631 million compared to $540 million and $419 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In 2015, this segment accounted for 23% of total sales. B/E estimates that, as of December 31, 2015, it had an aggregate installed base of business jet 
and super first class equipment, valued at replacement prices, of approximately $1.9 billion. 

     Financial results for BE's Business Jet segment were as follows:



According to B/E Aerospace, it is a leading manufacturer of a broad product line of furnishings for business jets. 
The company originated what is today's market for "Super First Class" suites and cabins twelve years ago. The company's products include a complete line 
of business jet seating and sofa products, including electric fully berthing lie-flat seats, both fluorescent and LED direct and indirect lighting, 
air valves and oxygen delivery systems as well as sidewalls, bulkheads, credenzas, closets, galley structures, lavatories, wastewater systems, de-icing systems, 
cabin management systems and tables. B/E has the capability to provide complete interior packages for business jets and executive VIP or head-of-state 
aircraft interiors, including design services, interior components and program management services. B/E's product portfolio also includes premium lightweight 
helicopter seats for double engine helicopter airframes for civil and military applications. 

B/E's business jet segment, which has had decades of experience in equipping executive, VIP and head-of-state aircraft, is the leading manufacturer 
of super first class cabin interior products for commercial wide-body aircraft. Super first class products incorporate a broad range of amenities 
such as luxurious first class cabins with appointments such as lie-flat seating, mini-bars, closets, flat screen televisions and mood lighting, 
which, until recently, were found only in VIP and head-of-state aircraft.

                    Activist Fund Has Tough Sell to Get Rockwell to Rethink Deal                
Starboard Value has asked Rockwell Collins to consider selling itself instead of buying B/E Aerospace. The hedge fund faces an uphill climb.











                    Aircraft Supplier Rockwell Collins to Buy B/E Aerospace for $6.4 Billion                
The merger, driven in part by pricing pressures from Boeing and Airbus, expands the range of products that Rockwell supplies and broadens its customer base internationally.

                    In Bantam, Rebuilding From Scratch                
WHEN B/E Aerospace announced last October that it would close its factory in Bantam, about 350 people knew they would soon be looking for new jobs. The company, which shut down Feb. 28, made airplane seats and was the biggest employer in Litchfield County. Months later, conversations in and around Bantam still quickly turn to B/E, with many people wondering how the former employees are faring.










COMPANY NEWS

                    B/E AEROSPACE PLANS TO BUY AIRCRAFT MODULAR PRODUCTS                
B/E Aerospace Inc. said yesterday that it planned to buy the closely held Aircraft Modular Products for $118 million in cash. Aircraft Modular Products has a 60 percent share of the market for new business jet interiors and more than 10,000 installed interiors that may need replacement parts.

History[edit]
Founded by Amin Khoury in 1987, B/E Aerospace has evolved from a $3 million company to $2.6 billion in revenue,[7] making it the world’s leading manufacturer of aircraft interior products and solutions for the commercial, business jet, and military markets. B/E’s history has been one of multiple acquisitions coupled with strong internal growth.[8]
On June 1, 2005, Air Canada awarded a $50-million (U.S.) contract to Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., to upgrade seating in 143 aircraft.[9]
In 2012, B/E's ALCI division became the sole source for all future lavatories on new build Boeing 737 aircraft. Introducing their patented Spacewall lavatory, airlines can take advantage of space provided to add up to 6 passenger seats per aircraft. Delta Air Lines was the launch customer, with the first aircraft delivery on 9/27/2013.
In December 2014, B/E announced that it had completed the spin-off of its aerospace fasteners and consumables business, creating KLX, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLXI).[10]
B/E Aerospace was bought in April 2017[11] for $6.4 billion by the avionics and aircraft connectivity provider Rockwell Collins based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which competes with Honeywell and more recently with Garmin. B/E shareholders would own 20% of the new Rockwell which would have $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.[12]
Products[edit]
The company is a major provider of airline seats to many airlines worldwide. Some significant customers include United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Customers using the company's most popular product - Diamond Business Class Seat, include Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air China, American Airlines, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, United Airlines and Virgin Australia. Some of B/E Aerospace's rivals in the airline seating industry include Acro Aircraft Seating in the UK, Zodiac Seats U.S. in Gainesville, Texas, Zodiac Seats France, STELIA Sogerma Seats in France, Geven in Italy, Recaro in Germany, and Aviointeriors in Italy.
In the Business Jet Seating segment, B/E Aerospace's main competitors are United Technologies Corporation's Decrane Aircraft Seating in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, Iacobucci in Italy, and PAC Seating Systems in Palm City, Florida.
B/E Aerospace also manufactures beverage makers, ovens, oxygen systems, lavatories and interior lighting for commercial aircraft and business jets.[13] B/E Aerospace's Interior Structures division based in Leighton Buzzard UK, manufactures and supplies galley monuments for the Airbus A350.
Oxygen Systems[edit]
The FAA announced on 11 August 2008 that it would investigate why "almost half the masks either did not deploy or failed to provide oxygen" during a pan-pan event on American Airlines Flight 31[14] The FAA had recently issued airworthiness directives regarding problems with defective inline flow indicators obstructing the BE Aerospace oxygen masks on several Boeing commercial aircraft models. B/E had identified a repair in February 2006. Boeing then issued a "Special Attention Service Bulletin" to inspect and if necessary repair the masks in April 2007. The directives only require action by April 2013 unless already done.[15]
Acquisition by Rockwell Collins[edit]
Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer and supplier of aviation and integrated solutions for both commercial and government applications, filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace before the Philippine Competition Commission since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.[16]
As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.[16]

B/E Aerospace, Inc. is a manufacturer of aircraft passenger cabin interior products for the commercial and business jet aircraft markets. B/E Aerospace has leading worldwide market shares in all of its major product lines and serves virtually all of the world's airlines, aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies through its direct global sales and customer support organizations.[citation needed] Based in Wellington, Florida,[5] the company was capitalized as a $4.2 billion corporation as of January 2016.[6]

History[edit]
Founded by Amin Khoury in 1987, B/E Aerospace has evolved from a $3 million company to $2.6 billion in revenue,[7] making it the world’s leading manufacturer of aircraft interior products and solutions for the commercial, business jet, and military markets. B/E’s history has been one of multiple acquisitions coupled with strong internal growth.[8]
On June 1, 2005, Air Canada awarded a $50-million (U.S.) contract to Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., to upgrade seating in 143 aircraft.[9]
In 2012, B/E's ALCI division became the sole source for all future lavatories on new build Boeing 737 aircraft. Introducing their patented Spacewall lavatory, airlines can take advantage of space provided to add up to 6 passenger seats per aircraft. Delta Air Lines was the launch customer, with the first aircraft delivery on 9/27/2013.
In December 2014, B/E announced that it had completed the spin-off of its aerospace fasteners and consumables business, creating KLX, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLXI).[10]
B/E Aerospace was bought in April 2017[11] for $6.4 billion by the avionics and aircraft connectivity provider Rockwell Collins based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which competes with Honeywell and more recently with Garmin. B/E shareholders would own 20% of the new Rockwell which would have $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.[12]
Products[edit]
The company is a major provider of airline seats to many airlines worldwide. Some significant customers include United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Customers using the company's most popular product - Diamond Business Class Seat, include Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air China, American Airlines, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, United Airlines and Virgin Australia. Some of B/E Aerospace's rivals in the airline seating industry include Acro Aircraft Seating in the UK, Zodiac Seats U.S. in Gainesville, Texas, Zodiac Seats France, STELIA Sogerma Seats in France, Geven in Italy, Recaro in Germany, and Aviointeriors in Italy.
In the Business Jet Seating segment, B/E Aerospace's main competitors are United Technologies Corporation's Decrane Aircraft Seating in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, Iacobucci in Italy, and PAC Seating Systems in Palm City, Florida.
B/E Aerospace also manufactures beverage makers, ovens, oxygen systems, lavatories and interior lighting for commercial aircraft and business jets.[13] B/E Aerospace's Interior Structures division based in Leighton Buzzard UK, manufactures and supplies galley monuments for the Airbus A350.
Oxygen Systems[edit]
The FAA announced on 11 August 2008 that it would investigate why "almost half the masks either did not deploy or failed to provide oxygen" during a pan-pan event on American Airlines Flight 31[14] The FAA had recently issued airworthiness directives regarding problems with defective inline flow indicators obstructing the BE Aerospace oxygen masks on several Boeing commercial aircraft models. B/E had identified a repair in February 2006. Boeing then issued a "Special Attention Service Bulletin" to inspect and if necessary repair the masks in April 2007. The directives only require action by April 2013 unless already done.[15]
Acquisition by Rockwell Collins[edit]
Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer and supplier of aviation and integrated solutions for both commercial and government applications, filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace before the Philippine Competition Commission since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.[16]
As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.[16]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
