                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Exhibit A-3, as applicable, with such appropriate insertions,
omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or

7







 



may have such letters, numbers or
other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements
placed thereon as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the
officers executing such Notes, as evidenced by their execution
thereof.  Any portion of the text of any Note may be set forth
on the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on
the face of the Note.



The Definitive Notes shall be
typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any
combination of these methods (with or without steel engraved
borders), all as determined by the officers executing such Notes,
as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.



Each Note shall be dated the date
of its authentication.  The terms of the Notes set forth in
Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 and Exhibit A-3 are part of the terms of
this Indenture.



SECTION 2.02  Execution,
Authentication and Delivery .  The Notes shall be executed
on behalf of the Issuer by any of its Authorized Officers. 
The signature of any such Authorized Officer on the Notes may be
manual or facsimile.  Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of individuals who were at any time Authorized Officers
of the Issuer shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior
to the authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold
such offices at the date of such Notes.  The Indenture Trustee
shall upon Issuer Order authenticate and deliver the Class
A‑1 Notes for original issue in an aggregate principal amount
of $354,000,000, the Class A‑2a Notes for original issue in
an aggregate principal amount of $261,000,000, the Class A-2b Notes

and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  Each Note
shall be dated the date of its authentication.



No Note shall be entitled to any
benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose, unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form included in Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as applicable, executed by the
Indenture Trustee by the manual or facsimile signature of one of
its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note
shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.



SECTION 2.03  Temporary
Notes .  Pending the preparation of Definitive Notes, the
Issuer may execute, and upon receipt of an Issuer Order the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes
that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or
otherwise produced, of the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of
which they are issued and with such variations not inconsistent
with the terms of this Indenture as the officers executing such
Notes may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such
Notes.  If temporary Notes are issued, the Issuer will cause
Definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable delay.

shall be exchangeable for Definitive



8







 



Notes upon surrender of the
temporary Notes at the office or agency of the Issuer to be
maintained as provided in Section 3.02, without charge to the
Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a like
principal amount of Definitive Notes of authorized
denominations.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall
in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as Definitive Notes.



SECTION 2.04  Registration;
Registration of Transfer and Exchange .



(a)     The Note
Registrar, acting as agent of the Issuer for this purpose only,
shall maintain a Note Register in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Note Registrar shall provide
for the registration of Notes and transfers and exchanges of Notes
as provided in this Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee is
hereby initially appointed Note Registrar for the purpose of
registering Notes and transfers and exchanges of Notes as provided
in this Indenture.  In the event that, subsequent to the
Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee notifies the Issuer that it is
unable to act as Note Registrar, the Issuer shall appoint another
bank or trust company, having an office or agency located in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, agreeing to act in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture applicable to it,
and otherwise acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, to act as
successor Note Registrar under this Indenture.  The Issuer
shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable
times and to obtain copies thereof.



If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the
Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of the
appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all
reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate executed on
behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to
the names and addresses of the Holders of the Notes and the
principal amounts and number of such Notes.



(b)    
[Reserved].



(c)    
[Reserved].



(d)     Upon the
proper surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the
office or agency of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in
Section 3.02, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class in authorized
denominations of a like aggregate principal amount.



(e)     At the
option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the
same Class in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at
such office or agency.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered
for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder making the
exchange is entitled to receive.  Every Note presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the



9







 



Indenture Trustee and the Note
Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.



(f)     No service
charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange
of Notes, but the Indenture Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of
Notes.



(g)     All Notes
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be
canceled and subsequently destroyed pursuant to Section
2.08.



(h)     Each
purchaser and transferee of a Note will be deemed to represent,
warrant and covenant either that (a) it is not acquiring such Note
with the assets of a Benefit Plan or (b) the acquisition, holding
and disposition of such Note will not give rise to a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code or a non-exempt violation under any law that is
substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.



(i)     The Retained
Notes transferred after the first Payment Date will not be
transferred, other than to a Person that is a United States person
for federal income tax purposes and provided that such Person
agrees to restrict subsequent transfers of such Notes to Persons
that are United States persons for federal income tax purposes,
unless a written Opinion of Counsel, which counsel and opinion
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, is
delivered to the Indenture Trustee to the effect that, for federal
income tax purposes, such Notes after such transfer will be treated
as debt.  In addition, if for tax or other reasons it may be
necessary to track such Notes (e.g., if the Notes have original
issue discount), tracking conditions such as requiring that such
Notes be in definitive registered form may be required by the
Administrator as a condition to such transfer.



SECTION 2.05  Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes .  If (i) any mutilated
Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture
Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction,
loss or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the
Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in
the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Issuer shall execute, and upon its request the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for
or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a
replacement Note of the same Class.  In connection with the
issuance of any new Note under this Section, the Issuer may require
payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto.



If, after the delivery of such
replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a
bona fide purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such
replacement Note was issued presents for payment such original
Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to
whom it was delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note
from such Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any
assignee of such Person, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided
therefor to the extent of



10







 



any loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection
therewith.



Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes of the same Class duly issued hereunder.



The provisions of this Section are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.



SECTION 2.06  Persons
Deemed Owners .  Prior to due presentment for registration
of transfer of any Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any
agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may treat the Person
in whose name any Note is registered (as of the day of
determination) as the owner of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payments of principal of and interest, if any, on such
Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Issuer,
the Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.



SECTION 2.07  Payments of
Principal and Interest .



(a)     The Class
A‑1 Notes, the Class A‑2a Notes, the Class A-2b Notes,
the Class A-3 Notes, the Class A-4 Notes and the Class B Notes
shall accrue interest during each Interest Period at the Class
A‑1 Rate, the Class A‑2a Rate, the Class A-2b Rate, the
Class A-3 Rate, the Class A-4 Rate and the Class B Rate,
respectively, and such interest shall be payable on each related
Payment Date as specified in such Notes, pursuant to Section 5.06
of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and Section 3.01 hereof. 
Any installment of interest or principal payable on any Note that
is punctually paid or duly provided for by the Issuer on the
applicable Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name
such Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered on the
Record Date by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such Person.



(b)     The
principal of each Note shall be payable in installments on each
Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement and subject to the availability of funds therefor. 
All principal payments on each Class of Notes shall be made pro
rata to the Noteholders of such Class entitled thereto. 
In accordance with Section 10.01, the Indenture Trustee shall
notify the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close
of business on the Record Date preceding the Payment Date on which
the final installment of principal of and interest on such Note
will be paid.  Such notice shall be mailed or transmitted by
facsimile not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to such
final Payment Date, shall specify that such final installment will
be payable only upon presentation and surrender of such Note and
shall specify the place where such Note may be presented and
surrendered for payment of such installment.

that any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust’s payment
(or allocations of income) to the Noteholders, such tax shall
reduce the amount otherwise



11







 



distributable to the Noteholders in
accordance with this Section.  The Issuer will instruct the
Indenture Trustee regarding the imposition of such withholding tax
and, upon receiving such instruction, the Indenture Trustee is
hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Noteholders sufficient funds for the payment
of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Indenture Trustee from
contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings, and withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of
such proceedings).  The amount of any withholding tax imposed
with respect to the Noteholders shall be treated as cash
distributed to the Noteholders at the time it is withheld by the
Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.  If
there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect
to any distribution (such as any distribution to a Non-U.S.
Person), the Indenture Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold
such amounts in accordance with this paragraph (c).  In the
event that any Noteholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Indenture Trustee shall reasonably cooperate
with the Noteholder in making such claim so long as the Noteholder
agrees to reimburse the Indenture Trustee for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred.

Cancellation .  All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any
Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by the Indenture
Trustee.  The Issuer may at any time deliver to the Indenture
Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly
canceled by the Indenture Trustee.  No Notes shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes canceled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture.  All canceled Notes may be held or disposed of by
the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or
disposal policy as in effect at the time unless the Issuer shall
direct by an Issuer Order that they be destroyed or returned to it;
provided , that such Issuer Order is timely and the Notes
have not been previously disposed of by the Indenture
Trustee.



SECTION 2.09  Release of
Collateral .  Subject to Sections 10.01 and 11.01 and the
terms of the Basic Documents, the Indenture Trustee shall release

be registered initially on the Note Register in the name of Cede
& Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no Note
Owner thereof will receive a Definitive Note representing such Note
Owner’s interest in such Note, except as provided in Section
2.12, and unless and until definitive, fully registered Notes (the

provisions of this Section shall be in full force and
effect;

Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with
the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Indenture (including

Notes and the giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as
the authorized representative of such Note Owners;



(c)     to the
extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any other
provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

of such Note Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing
Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and
agreements between such Note Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or
the Clearing Agency Participants pursuant to the Note Depository
Agreement.  Unless and until Definitive Notes are issued in
respect of the Book-Entry Notes pursuant to Section 2.12, the
initial Clearing Agency will make book‑entry transfers among
the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments
of principal of and interest on such Notes to such Clearing Agency
Participants; and

this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Holders of a specified percentage of

Notes) evidencing a specified percentage of the Outstanding Amount
of the Notes or of any Controlling Class or of such Class or of two
or more of such Classes, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to
represent such percentage only to the extent that it has received
instructions to such effect from Note Owners of Book-Entry Notes
and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in such Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture
Trustee.



SECTION 2.11  Notices to
Clearing Agency .  Whenever a notice or other
communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture,
unless and until Definitive Notes shall have been issued to the
Note Owners of Book-Entry Notes pursuant to Section 2.12, the
Indenture Trustee shall give all such notices and communications
specified herein to be given to Holders of the Book-Entry Notes to
the Clearing Agency and shall be deemed to have been given as of
the date of delivery to the Clearing Agency.



SECTION 2.12  Definitive
Notes .  In the case of the Book-Entry Notes, if (i) the
Owner Trustee or the Administrator advises the Indenture Trustee in
writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to
properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Book‑Entry Notes and the Owner Trustee and the Administrator
are unable to locate a qualified successor (and if the
Administrator has made such determination, the Administrator has
given written notice thereof to the Indenture Trustee), (ii) the
Seller or the Administrator or the Indenture Trustee at its option
advises each other such party in writing that it elects to
terminate the book‑entry system through the Clearing Agency
or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Servicer
Default, owners of the Book‑Entry Notes representing
beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Class of the Book-Entry
Notes, advise the Indenture Trustee and the Clearing Agency in
writing that the continuation of a book‑entry system through
the Clearing Agency or a successor thereto is no longer in the best
interests of the Note Owners acting together as a single Class,
then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Note Owners and the
Indenture Trustee of the occurrence of such event and of the
availability of Definitive Notes to Note Owners requesting the
same.  Upon

of the typewritten Notes representing the Book‑Entry Notes by
the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the
Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
the Definitive Notes in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency.  None of the Issuer, the Note Registrar or
the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of
such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions.  Upon the issuance
of Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the
Holders of the Definitive Notes as Noteholders.  None of the
Indenture Trustee, Issuer or Administrator shall be liable for any
inability to locate a qualified successor Clearing Agency. 
From and after the date of issuance of Definitive Notes, all
notices to be given to Noteholders will be mailed thereto at their
addresses of record in the Note Register as of the relevant Record
Date.  Such notices will be deemed to have been given as of
the date of mailing.



SECTION 2.13  Tax
Treatment .  The Issuer has entered into this Indenture,
and the Notes will be issued with the intention that, for federal,
state and local income, single business and franchise tax purposes,
the Notes (other than the Retained Notes) will qualify as
indebtedness of the Issuer, secured by the Trust Estate.  The
Issuer, by entering into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by
its acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its acceptance of
an interest in the applicable Book‑Entry Note), agree to
treat the Notes (other than the Retained Notes) for federal, state
and local income, single business and franchise tax purposes as
indebtedness of the Issuer.

Sections 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.  Amounts
properly withheld under the Code by any Person from a payment to
any Noteholder or the Certificateholder of interest and/or
principal shall be considered as having been paid by the Issuer to
such Noteholder or the Certificateholder for all purposes of this
Indenture.



SECTION 3.02  Maintenance
of Office or Agency .  The Issuer will maintain in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency
where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in
respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served.  The
Issuer hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee to serve as
its agent for the foregoing purposes.  The Issuer will give
prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of the location, and
of any change in the location, of any such office or agency. 
If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or
agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the
address thereof, such surrenders, notices and demands may be made
or served at the Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby
appoints the Indenture Trustee as its agent to receive all such
surrenders, notices and demands.



SECTION 3.03  Money for
Payments To Be Held in Trust .  All payments of amounts
due and payable with respect to any Notes or the Certificate that
are to be made from amounts withdrawn from the Collection Account
or Reserve Account, pursuant to Sections 2.07, 3.01, 4.02 and 4.03
shall be made on behalf of the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or
by a Paying Agent, and no amounts so withdrawn from such accounts
for payments of Notes or the Certificate shall be paid over to the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Administrator except as provided
in this Section.



On or prior to 11:00am New York
time on each Payment Date, the Issuer shall deposit in the
Collection Account or, in accordance with the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, cause to be deposited (including by the provision of
instructions to the Indenture Trustee to make any required
withdrawals from the Reserve Account and to deposit such amounts in
the Collection Account) to the extent of funds available therefor,
an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the amounts then becoming due
under the Notes and the Certificate, such sum to be held in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless the
Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall promptly notify the
Indenture Trustee of its action or failure so to act.



The Indenture Trustee, as Paying
Agent, hereby agrees with the Issuer that it will, and the Issuer
will cause each Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee, as a
condition to its acceptance of its appointment as Paying Agent, to
execute and deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which
such Paying Agent shall agree with the Indenture Trustee, subject
to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent
will:



(a)     hold all
sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to the
Notes, the Certificate, or for release to the Issuer for payment to
the Certificateholder in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or
otherwise disposed of as herein provided and pay or release such
sums to such Persons as herein provided;



15







 



(b)     give the
Indenture Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or any other
obligor upon the Notes) of which it has actual knowledge in the
making of any payment required to be made with respect to the Notes
or the release of any amounts to the Issuer to be paid to the
Certificateholder;



(c)     at any time
during the continuance of any such default, upon the written
request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture
Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent;



(d)     immediately
resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes (or for
release to the Issuer) if at any time it ceases to meet the
standards required to be met by a Paying Agent at the time of its
appointment; and



(e)     comply with
all requirements of the Code with respect to the withholding from
any payments made by it on any Notes, or the Certificate (or
assisting the Issuer to withhold from payment to the
Certificateholder) of any applicable withholding taxes imposed
thereon and with respect to any applicable reporting requirements
in connection therewith.



The Issuer may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any
Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust
by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such
Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.



In the event that any Noteholder
shall not surrender its Notes for retirement within six months
after the date specified in the written notice of final payment
described in Section 2.07, the Indenture will give a second written
notice to the registered Noteholders that have not surrendered
their Notes for final payment and retirement.  If within one
year after such second notice any Notes have not been surrendered,
the Indenture Trustee shall, at the expense and direction of the
Issuer, cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the
English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of
general circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which
shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication,
any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to
California Special Olympics.  The Indenture Trustee shall also
adopt and employ, at the expense and direction of the Issuer, any
other reasonable means of notification of such repayment specified
by the Issuer or the Administrator.



SECTION 3.04  Existence
.  The Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of
Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is
or becomes, organized under the laws of any other State or of the
United States of America, in which case the Issuer will keep in
full effect its existence, rights and franchises under the laws of
such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and preserve its
qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral and
each other instrument or agreement included in the Trust
Estate.



16







 



SECTION 3.05  Protection of
Trust Estate .  The Issuer shall from time to time execute
and deliver or file, as applicable, all such supplements and
amendments hereto and all such financing statements, continuation
statements, instruments of further assurance and other instruments,
and will take such other action necessary or advisable
to:



(a)     maintain or
preserve the lien and security interest (and the priority thereof)
of this Indenture or carry out more effectively the purposes
hereof;



(b)     perfect,
publish notice of or protect the validity of any Grant made or to
be made by this Indenture;



(c)     enforce any
of the Collateral; or



(d)     preserve and
defend title to the Trust Estate and the rights of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders in such Trust Estate against the claims
of all persons and parties.



The Issuer hereby designates the
Indenture Trustee its agent and attorney‑in‑fact to
execute any financing statement, continuation statement or other
instrument required to be executed pursuant to this Section
3.05.



SECTION 3.06  Opinions as
to Trust Estate .



(a)     On the
Closing Date, the Issuer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either stating that,
in the opinion of such counsel, such action has been taken with
respect to the execution, recording and filing of this Indenture,
any indentures supplemental hereto, any requisite financing
statements and continuation statements and any other requisite
documents necessary to perfect and make effective the lien and
security interest of this Indenture or stating that, in the opinion
of such counsel, no such action is necessary to make such lien and
security interest effective.



(b)     As and when
specified in Section 10.02(h) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Issuer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the
Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either stating that, in the
opinion of such counsel, such action has been taken with respect to
the execution, recording, filing or re‑recording and refiling
of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto, any
financing statements and continuation statements and any other
requisite documents necessary to maintain the lien and security
interest created by this Indenture or stating that in the opinion
of such counsel no such action is necessary to maintain such lien
and security interest.  Such Opinion of Counsel shall also
describe the execution, recording, filing or re-recording and
refiling of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto, any
financing statements and continuation statements and any other
documents that will, in the opinion of such counsel, be required to
maintain the lien and security interest of this Indenture until the
date in the following calendar year on which such Opinion of
Counsel must again be delivered.



SECTION 3.07  Performance
of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables .



(a)     The Issuer
will not take any action and will use its best efforts not to
permit any action to be taken by others that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material



17







 



covenants or obligations under any
instrument or agreement included in the Trust Estate or that would
result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination
or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any
such instrument or agreement, except in each case as expressly
provided in the Basic Documents.



(b)     The Issuer
may contract with other Persons to assist it in performing its
duties under this Indenture, and any performance of such duties by
a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Officer’s
Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be action taken by the
Issuer.  Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the
Servicer and the Administrator to assist the Issuer in performing
its duties under this Indenture.



(c)     The Issuer
will punctually perform and observe all of its obligations and
agreements contained in the Basic Documents and in the instruments
and agreements included in the Trust Estate, including but not
limited to filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing
statements and continuation statements required to be filed by the
terms of the Trust Agreement, this Indenture and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement in accordance with and within the time periods
provided for herein and therein.



(d)     If an
Authorized Officer of the Issuer shall have actual knowledge of the
occurrence of a Servicer Default under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee
in writing and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the
Issuer is taking with respect of such default, and the Indenture
Trustee shall promptly notify the Administrator of such Servicer
Default and proposed actions of the Issuer, and the Administrator
shall provide such notice to the Rating Agencies.  If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure.



(e)     As promptly
as possible after the giving of notice of termination to the
Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 8.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or if the
Servicer resigns in accordance with Section 7.05 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt
written notice of such event to the Noteholders and the
Administrator and the Administrator shall provide such notice to
the Rating Agencies.  The Indenture Trustee shall act to
appoint a successor servicer pursuant to Section 8.02 of the Sale
and Servicing Agreement (any such successor servicer, a
“Successor Servicer”).  Any such Successor
Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a
form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee.  In the event that a
Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted its
appointment as set forth in Section 8.02 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer and shall
thereafter be entitled to the Servicing Fee.  Notwithstanding
the above, the Indenture Trustee shall, if it shall be unwilling or
legally unable so to act, appoint or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint any established institution having a net
worth of not less than $25,000,000 and whose regular business shall
include the servicing of automobile and/or light-duty truck
receivables, as the successor to the Servicer under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of Section
8.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.  Upon such
appointment, the Indenture Trustee will be released from the duties
and obligations of



18







 



acting as Successor Servicer, such
release effective upon the effective date of the servicing
agreement entered into between the Successor Servicer and the
Issuer.



In connection with any such
appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor as it and such Successor
Servicer shall agree, subject to the limitations set forth below
and in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 8.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall
enter into an agreement with such successor for the servicing of
the Receivables (such agreement to be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee).  If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI hereof shall be
inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as Successor
Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables.  In case the
Indenture Trustee shall become the Successor Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to appoint a subservicer;
provided , that the Indenture Trustee, in its capacity as
Successor Servicer, shall remain fully liable for the actions and
omissions of such subservicer.



(f)     Without
derogating from the absolute nature of the assignment granted to
the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, the Issuer agrees that it will not
enter into any amendment, modification, supplement or waiver with
respect to any Basic Document except (i) to cure any ambiguity, to
correct or supplement any provisions in this Agreement or for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or
eliminating any of the provisions in this Agreement or of modifying
in any manner the rights of the Noteholders or the
Certificateholder or to add, modify or eliminate any provisions as
may be necessary or advisable in order to enable the Seller, the
Servicer or any of their Affiliates to comply with or obtain more
favorable treatment under any law or regulation or any accounting
rule or principle (whether now or in the future in effect);
provided , however , that such action shall not, as
evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered by the
Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, adversely
affect in any material respect the interests of any Noteholder or
Certificateholder; (ii) for the purpose of changing the formula or
percentage for determining the Specified Reserve Account Balance,
but not to change any order of priority of payments and
distributions specified in Section 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement), changing the remittance schedule for the deposit of
collections with respect to the Receivables in the Collection
Account pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement or changing the definition of Eligible Investment, in
each case only if the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied in
respect thereof; or (iii) with the consent of the Indenture Trustee
and satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to such action
set forth in the related Basic Document. If any such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver shall be so consented to by the
Indenture Trustee or such Holders, as applicable, the Issuer
agrees, promptly following a request by the Indenture Trustee to
agree to such amendment and to execute and deliver, in its own name
and at its own expense, such agreements, instruments, consents and
other documents as the Indenture Trustee may deem necessary or
appropriate in the circumstances to implement such amendment and to
cause the relevant Basic Documents, as amended, to be enforceable
against the Issuer.



SECTION 3.08  Negative
Covenants .  So long as any Notes are Outstanding, the
Issuer shall not:



19







 



(a)     except as
expressly permitted by Basic Documents, sell, transfer, exchange or
otherwise dispose of any of the properties or assets of the Issuer,
including those included in the Trust Estate, unless directed to do
so by the Indenture Trustee;



(b)     claim any
credit on, or make any deduction from the principal or interest
payable in respect of, the Notes (other than amounts properly
withheld from such payments under the Code) or assert any claim
against any present or former Noteholder by reason of the payment
of the taxes levied or assessed upon any part of the Trust
Estate;



(c)     except as
may be expressly permitted hereby and by the Basic Documents, (A)
permit the validity or effectiveness of this Indenture to be
impaired, or permit the lien of this Indenture to be amended,
hypothecated, subordinated, terminated or discharged, or permit any
Person to be released from any covenants or obligations with
respect to the Notes under this Indenture, (B) permit any lien,
charge, excise, claim, security interest, mortgage or other
encumbrance (other than the liens of this Indenture) to be created
on or extend to or otherwise arise upon or burden the Trust Estate
or any part thereof or any interest therein or the proceeds thereof
(other than tax liens, mechanics’ liens and other liens that
arise by operation of law, in each case on any of the Financed
Vehicles and arising solely as a result of an action or omission of
the related Obligor), (C) permit the lien of this Indenture not to
constitute a valid first priority (other than with respect to any
such tax, mechanics’ or other lien) security interest in the
Trust Estate or (D) dissolve or liquidate in whole or in part;
or



(d)     assume or
incur any indebtedness other than the Notes, or other than as
expressly contemplated by this Indenture (in connection with the
obligation to pay expenses from the Trust Estate) or by the Basic
Documents as in effect on the date hereof.



SECTION 3.09  Annual
Statement as to Compliance .



(a)     The Issuer
will cause the Servicer to deliver to the Indenture Trustee
concurrently with its delivery thereof to the Issuer the annual
statement of compliance described in Section 4.11 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement.  In addition, on the same date annually
upon which such annual statement of compliance is to be delivered
by the Servicer, the Issuer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate stating, as to the Authorized
Officer signing such Officer’s Certificate, that:

the activities of the Issuer during such year and of its
performance under this Indenture has been made under such

the Issuer has complied with all conditions and covenants under
this Indenture throughout such year, or, if there has been a

specifying each such default known to such Authorized Officer and
the nature and status thereof.

Trustee if given by Noteholders), and upon any such declaration the
unpaid principal amount of such Notes, together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon through the date of acceleration, shall
become immediately due and payable.



At any time after such declaration
of acceleration of maturity has been made and before a judgment or
decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Indenture Trustee as hereinafter in this Article V provided, the
Holders of Notes representing at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling Class, acting
together as a single Class, without the consent of the

has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient

No such rescission shall affect any
subsequent default or impair any right consequent
thereto.



SECTION 5.03  Collection of
Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Indenture Trustee
.



(a)     The Issuer
covenants that if (i) Default is made in the payment of any
interest on any Note of the Controlling Class, so long as any
amounts remain unpaid with respect to such Controlling Class of
Notes, when the same becomes due and payable, and such default
continues for a period of five (5) Business Days, or (ii) default
is made in the payment of the principal of or any installment of
the principal of any Note when the same becomes due and payable (as
described in the penultimate paragraph of Section 5.01 hereof), the
Issuer will, upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to the
Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, the
whole amount then due and payable on such Class of Notes for
principal and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal
and, to the extent payment at such rate of interest shall be
legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest at the
rate borne by the Notes and in addition thereto such further amount
as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents
and counsel.



(b)     In case the
Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand,
the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust, may institute a Proceeding for the collection of the sums so
due and unpaid, and may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or
final decree, and may enforce the same against the Issuer or other
obligor upon such Notes and collect in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Notes,
wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be
payable.



(c)     If an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, as
more particularly provided in Section 5.04, in its discretion,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders and, incidentally thereto, the Certificateholder, by
such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture Trustee shall deem
most effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or
to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable right
vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or by
law.



(d)     In case
there shall be pending, relative to the Issuer or any other obligor
upon the Notes or any Person having or claiming an ownership
interest in the Trust Estate, Proceedings under Title 11 of the
United States Code or any other applicable federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver,
assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator,
sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or
taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other
obligor or Person, or in case of any other comparable judicial
Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes,
or to the



29







 



creditors or property of the Issuer
or such other obligor, then, irrespective of whether the principal
of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or
by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Indenture Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the
provisions of this Section, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such Proceedings or
otherwise:



(i)     to file and
prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes and distributions
unpaid in respect of the Certificate, and to file such other papers
or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim for reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor
Indenture Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and
counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities
incurred, and all advances made, by the Indenture Trustee and each
predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result of negligence or
bad faith) and of the Noteholders and the Certificateholder allowed
in such Proceedings;



(ii)     unless
prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of
the Holders of Notes in any election of a trustee, a standby
trustee or Person performing similar functions in any such
Proceedings;



(iii)     to collect
and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on
any such claims and to distribute all amounts received with respect
to the claims of the Noteholders or the Certificateholder and of
the Indenture Trustee on their behalf; and



(iv)     to file
such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Indenture
Trustee, the Holders of Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings
relative to the Issuer, its creditors and its property; and any
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official
in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of such
Noteholders to make payments to the Indenture Trustee and, in the
event that the Indenture Trustee shall consent to the making of
payments directly to such Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture
Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture
Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all
other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by
the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee except
as a result of negligence or bad faith.



(e)     Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee
to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any
Holder thereof or to authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding
except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in
bankruptcy or similar Person.



(f)     All rights
of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under
any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Indenture Trustee without
the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any
trial or other Proceedings relative thereto, and any such action
or



30







 



Proceedings instituted by the
Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an
express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment
of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Indenture
Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective
agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the
Holders of the Notes and, incidentally thereto, for the benefit of
the Certificateholder.



(g)     In any
Proceedings brought by the Indenture Trustee (and also any
Proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this
Indenture to which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the
Indenture Trustee shall be held to represent all the Noteholders,
and it shall not be necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any
such Proceedings.



SECTION 5.04  Remedies;
Priorities .



(a)     If an Event
of Default under Section 5.01 shall have occurred and be continuing
which results in the acceleration of the Notes (whether or not the
Trust Estate is sold in one or more public or private sales as
provided in Section 5.04(b)(iv)), and unless and until such
acceleration has been rescinded, the Indenture Trustee will make
payments on the Notes and the Certificate as set forth in Section
5.06(c) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, rather than pursuant
to Section 5.06(b) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.



(b)     In
accordance with Section 5.03, if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may do one or
more of the following (subject to Section 5.05):



(i)     institute
Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for
the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes, or under
this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or
otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the
Issuer and any other obligor upon such Notes moneys adjudged
due;



(ii)     institute
Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial
foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Trust
Estate;



(iii)     exercise
any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take any other
appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies
of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders; and



(iv)     sell the
Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein,
at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any
manner permitted by law;  provided , however ,
that, notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary,
the Indenture Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust
Estate following an Event of Default, other than an Event of
Default described in Section 5.01(a) or (b), unless (A) the Holders
of 100% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling
Class consent thereto or (B) the proceeds of such sale or
liquidation distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to
discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon such Notes
for principal and interest or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines
that the Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds
on an ongoing basis to make all payments of principal of and
interest on the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes
had not been declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee
obtains the consent of Holders of 66‑2/3% of the Outstanding
Amount of the Notes of the



31







 



Controlling Class (acting together
as a single Class).  In determining such sufficiency or
insufficiency with respect to clause (B) and (C), the Indenture
Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an
Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national
reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to
the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose.  In
connection with any such sale, the Indenture Trustee will afford
the Holders of each Class of Notes adequate advance notice and
information as to the conduct of such sale such that any such
Holders (acting individually, as Classes, as a single Class or
otherwise) will be reasonably able to submit bids for the purchase
of the assets to be liquidated, and that the Indenture Trustee will
consider any and all such bids on the same basis that it considers
any other bids submitted by any other party or parties.  The
proceeds of such sale or liquidation (net of the expenses incurred
by the Indenture Trustee in connection with the conduct thereof,
which will be retained by the Indenture Trustee from such proceeds)
will be treated as collections and deposited into the Collection
Account by the Indenture Trustee for distribution to the
Noteholders and the Certificateholder in accordance with the
priorities specified in Section 5.06(c) of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.  The Indenture Trustee will have no liability with
respect to the amount of such proceeds or the adequacy thereof to
make payments in full of any Class of Notes or the
Certificate.



The Indenture Trustee may fix a
record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders
pursuant to this Section.  At least 15 days before such record
date, the Issuer shall mail to each Noteholder and the Indenture
Trustee a notice that states the related record date, payment date
and amount to be paid.



SECTION 5.05  Optional
Preservation of the Receivables .  Except as provided in
Section 5.04(b)(iv), if the Notes have been declared to be due and
payable under Section 5.02 following an Event of Default and such
declaration and its consequences have not been rescinded and
annulled, the Indenture Trustee may, unless otherwise directed by
the Holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the
Notes of the Controlling Class, acting together as a single Class,
but need not, elect to maintain possession of the Trust Estate and
direct the Issuer, Servicer and Administrator not to take steps to
liquidate the Receivables.  It is the desire of the parties
hereto and the Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient
funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes,
and the Indenture Trustee shall take such desire into account when
determining whether or not to maintain possession of the Trust
Estate.  In determining whether to maintain possession of the
Trust Estate, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and
rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or
accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of
such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate
for such purpose.



SECTION 5.06  Limitation of
Suits .  No Holder of any Note shall have any right to
institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to
this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or
for any other remedy hereunder, except pursuant to the dispute
resolution procedures described in Section 11.02 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, unless such Holder has previously given
written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a continuing Event of
Default, and:



32







 



(a)     the Event of
Default arises from the Servicer’s failure to remit payments
when due or



(b)     the Holders
of not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the
Controlling Class, acting together as a single Class, have made
written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute such
Proceeding in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
Indenture Trustee hereunder and have offered to the Indenture
Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred in complying with such request and the

preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under
this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided.



SECTION 5.07  Unconditional
Rights of Noteholders To Receive Principal and Interest .

such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the
consent of such Holder.

Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined

in every such case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.



SECTION 5.09  Rights and
Remedies Cumulative .  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is
intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given

otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion
or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

the Noteholders, as the case may be.

Noteholders .  The Holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling Class, acting

available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee;
provided , that:



(i)     such
direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with
this Indenture;



(ii)     any
direction to the Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust
Estate shall be by Holders of Notes representing not less than
percentages of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the relevant
Class set forth in Section 5.04 or 5.05, as applicable;
and

Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Indenture Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction.



Notwithstanding the rights of
Noteholders set forth in this Section, subject to Sections 5.07 and
6.01, the Indenture Trustee need not take any action that it
determines would be illegal or may not lawfully be taken, might
subject it to personal liability or would be unduly
prejudicial  to the rights of any Noteholders not consenting
to such action.

Past Defaults .  Prior to the declaration of the
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes as provided in Section
5.02 or the liquidation or sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to

of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling Class
(acting together as a single Class), without the consent of the
Holder of the Certificate; may waive any past Default, Event of
Default or Servicer Default and its consequences except a (a)
Servicer Default in the deposit of collections or other required
amounts into the Collection Account or Reserve Account, or (b)
Default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Note.  In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to
their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
impair any right consequent thereto.



Upon any such waiver, such Default
shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to
have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.



SECTION 5.13  Undertaking
for Costs .  All parties to this Indenture agree, and each
Holder of any Note or Note Owner by such Holder’s acceptance
of such Note or beneficial interest therein, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in
its



34







 



discretion require, in any suit for
the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in
any suit against the Indenture Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it as Indenture Trustee, the filing by any
party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of
such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the
merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party
litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to (a)
any suit instituted by the Indenture Trustee, (b) any suit
instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, in each case
holding in the aggregate more than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of
Notes of the Controlling Class or (c) any suit instituted by any
Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or
interest on any Note on or after the respective due dates expressed
in such Note and in this Indenture.



SECTION 5.14  Waiver of
Stay or Extension Laws .  The Issuer covenants (to the
extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time
insist upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever, claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all
benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will
not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.



SECTION 5.15  Action on
Notes .  The Indenture Trustee’s right to seek and
recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be
affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other
relief under or with respect to this Indenture.  Neither the
lien of this Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture
Trustee or the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any
judgment by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy
of any execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust
Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer.  Any money or
property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in
accordance with Section 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.

and Enforcement of Certain Obligations .

following a request from the Indenture Trustee to do so and at the
Administrator’s expense, the Issuer shall take all such
lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to compel or
secure the performance and observance by the Seller or the
Servicer, as applicable, of each of their obligations to the Issuer
under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement or by
the Seller of its remedies under or in connection with the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, and to exercise any and all rights,
remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer
under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement to the
extent and in the manner directed by the Indenture Trustee,
including the transmission of notices of default on the part of the
Seller or the Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal or
administrative actions or proceedings to compel or secure
performance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of their
respective obligations under the Sale and Servicing Agreement or
the Receivables Purchase Agreement.



(b)     If an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee
may, and at the direction (which direction shall be in writing or
by telephone, confirmed in writing



35







 



promptly thereafter) of the Holders
of 66‑2/3% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the

exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the
Issuer against the Seller and the Servicer under or in connection
with the Sale and Servicing Agreement, against the Seller under or
in connection with the Receivables Purchase Agreement, or against
the Administrator under the Administration Agreement, including the
right or power to take any action to compel or secure performance
