 December 15, 2015
To the Shareholders of
CNL Growth Properties, Inc.  
 
RE:EVEREST OFFER PRICE INCREASED TO $5.70 PER SHARE 
 
Dear Shareholder:
 
 Everest REIT Investors I, LLC is now offering to purchase 1,130,000 common shares (the "Shares"), in CNL Growth Properties, Inc. (the "Corporation"), for cash in the increased amount of $5.70 per Share upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in our Offer to Purchase dated December 2, 2015, and the related Transfer Agreement (together, the “Offer”).  The Offer was mailed to you previously. Investors should consider the following:
Our offer is $0.45 per Share (8.6%) higher than the offer by CMG to purchase Shares.
The most recent reported sales of the Shares were at a weighted average of $5.85 per Share.  Our offer exceeds that price after accounting for the $1-$1.70 per Share capital distribution recently declared by the Corporation which you will keep, assuming it is paid before the Offer expires as the Corporation has announced, and our offer avoids the payment of commissions, which often exceed 5% of the sale price. 
The Corporation suspended its redemption program and has no expectation of reinstating it, and the Shares are not traded on any public market.
The Corporation states that there is no specific date by which it must have a liquidity event, and there is no assurance of a liquidity event in the near term.
A revised Transfer Agreement is enclosed which you can use to tender your Shares, but if you have already sent the prior Transfer Agreement you WILL receive the increased price.  Please complete and execute this Transfer Agreement in accordance with the Instructions provided with the previous Offer materials and return it in the envelope provided with the previous Offer materials. Please make sure we receive your executed Transfer Agreement prior to our Expiration Date if you have tendered to CMG and want to receive the higher price we are offering. We will withdraw your previous tender to CMG as permitted in the Transfer Agreement.  You should read the entire Offer before tendering your Shares. 
A complete copy of the Offer documents is available from the following website: Go to:  www.vroomspro.com/Login.aspx Login: CNL Growth; Password: Password1 (case sensitive), or is also available from the SEC’s EDGAR website at www.sec.gov.  The Purchaser may extend the offer, in which case, the Purchaser will make a public announcement by press release and by posting on the foregoing website no later than 9:00 AM Eastern Time the next business day after the scheduled expiration date. If you would like a complete copy of the Offer documents mailed or emailed to you at no charge, please contact Stacey McClain
in our Investor Relations department, at (800) 611-4613, or by email to CNLGrowthOffer@everestworld.com. 
The expiration of the Offer has been extended to 5:00 pm Pacific Time on January 6, 2016.
 
 Very truly yours,
 Everest REIT Investors I, LLC

 October 10, 2016
To the Shareholders of
Moody National REIT I, Inc.  
 
RE:NOTIFICATION OF OFFER TO PURCHASE 
 
Dear Shareholder:
 
 Everest REIT Investors I, LLC is offering to purchase 670,000 common shares (the "Shares"), in Moody National REIT I, Inc. (the "Corporation"), for cash in the amount of $7.75 per Share upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in our Offer to Purchase dated October 10, 2016, and the related Transfer Agreement (together, the “Offer”).  Investors should consider the following:
Our Offer gives you the opportunity to GET CASH IN 2016 for your Shares. The Corporation’s stock redemption plan has been suspended.
The Corporation recently announced a non-binding letter of intent to merge with its affiliate, Moody National REIT II, Inc. for $10.25-$11.00 per Share; but approximately half of such amount, or more, would be paid in REIT II shares. REIT II’s shares are not listed on any exchange and have a highly uncertain value. REIT II advises that its estimated value for its shares, which would be paid for your Shares in the merger, should not be relied upon.
The Corporation has provided no assurances that you would receive cash for your Shares if the merger is consummated. Shareholders of the Corporation will become shareholders of REIT II, which was organized in 2014 and is still selling its shares in its initial public offering. After more than 19 months, REIT II has raised less than 10% of the capital it is seeking from its initial public offering.
REIT II did not qualify as a REIT for years 2014 or 2015 and the Corporation has not provided any assurances that REIT II will qualify as a REIT for 2016. Failing to qualify as a REIT will have adverse tax consequences for REIT II shareholders.
A Transfer Agreement is enclosed which you can use to tender your Shares.  Please complete and execute this Transfer Agreement in accordance with the enclosed Instructions and return it in the envelope provided. You should read the entire Offer before tendering your Shares. 
A copy of the Offer documents is available from the following website: Go to:  www.v-rooms.com/login/plus/ Login: Moody; Password: Password1 (case sensitive); or from the SEC’s EDGAR website at www.sec.gov; or a free copy will be mailed or emailed to you  upon request to Stacey McClain in our Investor Relations department, at (800) 611-4613, or by email to MoodyOffer@everestworld.com.
The Purchaser may extend the offer, in which case, the Purchaser will make a public announcement by press release and by posting on the foregoing website no later than 9:00 AM Eastern Time the next business day after the scheduled expiration date.  The Offer to Purchase contains information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and is incorporated herein by reference.  
Unless extended, our offer will expire at 5:00 pm Pacific Time on November 16, 2016.
 
 Very truly yours,
 Everest REIT Investors I, LLC

About Everest
Since its founding in 1994 by W. Robert Kohorst, Everest has invested in limited partnerships that held real estate and other assets. Everest has invested funds in excess of $200,000,000 in more than 650 limited partnerships; providing liquidity for an otherwise illiquid asset class. In addition to investing, Everest has replaced general partners and asset managers, upon the investors’ request, and worked to restructure the operation and financial management of undermanaged or undercapitalized real estate assets. Everest specializes in reorganizing assets to provide stable cash flow, downside protection and an opportunity for a profitable exit.
Everest has also acquired and holds a portfolio of properties in various categories.  With few exceptions, Everest holds a significant majority of the equity in each property within its portfolio.  Everest’s current portfolio of property is estimated to exceed $500,000,000 in value.
Everest’s restructuring experience and understanding of complex investment structures makes Everest uniquely suited to manage complex real estate transactions. Everest has been successful in taking advantage of both buying and selling opportunities by implementing a financial model that stresses stable cash flow with moderate leverage, resulting in consistent distributions to investors. Everest specializes in the acquisition, recapitalization and asset management of real estate, with specific experience in real estate investment trusts, tenant-in- common, corporate and limited partnership real estate investment entities.
Everest has provided solutions for investors seeking to sell illiquid real estate holdings; we understand investors’ goals since we are an investor and always invest our own capital alongside our institutional and individual partners. Everest has a long, successful history of working with institutional partners, lending institutions and Government-Sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
We believe our analysis of market fundamentals combined with submarket knowledge, a meticulous due diligence process and our strong analytical and operational skills provide a strategic advantage which allows Everest to identify investments that are likely to outperform the market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
