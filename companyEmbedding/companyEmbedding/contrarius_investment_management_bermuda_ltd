Notice of non-solicitation

        The information provided in any e-mail sent by Contrarius is provided to the recipient only and for the information purposes of the recipient only. Such information is not intended for, may not, without the express consent of Contrarius, be distributed to, and may not be relied upon by, any other party, including without limitation, any advisory or other client of the recipient.

Contrarius wishes to caution you that such projections are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. Contrarius is an active manager and any statement that relates to a specific issuer should not be treated as a representation that Contrarius is pursuing any particular trading strategy. In particular, where the website or the content received through e-mail services provides commentary on securities, financial instruments, indices, financial products or indicators, or economic conditions, it is done in the context of investment decisions for the Funds. It is not intended to be, and it should not be construed as, a recommendation to (or not to) deal in the particular security, index or financial instrument. Contrarius may be buying or selling any securities or other financial instrument discussed.
