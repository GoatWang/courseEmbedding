Product Description▼▲
Perhaps no Old Testament book is as far-reaching in envisioning historical events as the Book of Daniel. In this revised edition of his classic work on premillennial prophecy, Walvoord addresses alleged historical inaccuracies, considers past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies, explores different approaches to interpretation, and examines textual and doctrinal issues. Based on the ESV. 256 pages, hardcover from Moody.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The book of Daniel is key to the entire Old Testament prophetic revelation. Who better to help you understand Daniel's stories, prophecies, and dreamsand give you a brighter hope for things to comethan John F. Walvoord, one of evangelicalism's most prominent leaders, and Charles Dyer, a Bible professor and expert on Israel? In this second work of a renewed series of commentaries, Dr. Walvoord addresses alleged historical inaccuracies and considers past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies. At key points different views and approaches to interpretation are explored.  Walvoord devotes special attention to textual and doctrinal issues while avoiding technical language.Refined, updated with the English Standard Version (ESV), and streamlined, this classic text is set to help you understand and interpret the book of Daniel and gain a better grasp of what the future may bring.

JOHN F. WALVOORD (A.B., D.D., Wheaton College; A.M., Texas Christian University; Th.B., Th.M., Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary), former president of Dallas Theological Seminary and editor of Bibliotheca Sacra, America's oldest theological quarterly, was recognized as one of the leading evangelical theologians in America and an authority on systematic theology and eschatology. His academic background and extensive travel in the Middle East greatly enriched his theological and eschatological studies. He authored numerous books on theology and biblical prophecy, including The Revelation of Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ Our Lord, and Daniel: The Key to Prophetic Revelation.CHARLES DYER (B.A., Washington Bible College; Th.M. and Ph.D., Dallas Theological Seminary) served as provost and dean of education at Moody Bible Institute before becoming Professor-at-Large of Bible at Moody and host of The Land and the Book radio program. Before coming to Moody, Charlie served for 20 years in multiple administrative and faculty roles at Dallas Theological Seminary - ultimately serving as Executive Vice President under Chuck Swindoll. In addition to his role as host of The Land and the Book radio program, Charlie is an Old Testament scholar and an authority on Middle Eastern history and geography. He also serves as Associate Pastor of Grace Bible Church in Sun City, Arizona. Charlie has traveled extensively throughout the Middle East for more than 30 years, leading more than 80 trips. He is the author of numerous books, including A Voice in the Wilderness, What's Next?, The New Christian Traveler's Guide, Character Counts: The Power of Personal Integrity, and Thirty Days in the Land with Jesus. His most recent book is The Isis Crisis. Charlie and his wife, Kathy, have been married for more than 40 years and have two grown children.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Daniel, John M carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Daniel, John M currently holds license 245076 (Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Daniel, John M



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Daniel, John M



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Daniel, John M



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsAt the annual convention of the American Booksellers Association Convention, everything goes wrong. Julia Child's cooking demonstration in the Random House aisle blows up and catches fire. A top New York editor catches a pie in the face. Invitations to the most exclusive publisher's party are stolen and all the wrong people show up. Worse, Heidi Yamada, the world-famous poet, is found dead, spread over the late Elvis Presley's king-sized bed. It's all caught on film by a busy photographer from Publishers Weekly, a woman soon kidnapped. When the Las Vegas Police shrug their shoulders, Guy Mallon, Heidi's first publisher (and a discarded lover) wonders what to do. Poor Guy. He's a bookman from Santa Barbara who, despite Ross Macdonald and Sue Grafton, never felt inspired to be a sleuth, but he feels he owes it to Heidi. Besides, catching her killer may be his only chance to leave Las Vegas alive.... The Poet's Funeral is a romp rich with poetry, publishing, book collecting, and literary gossip. Its cast ranges from smalltime players to the famous Rock Bottom Remaiders. It's a story of ego, love, art, and murder during four hot days at the 1990 ABA.Review*STARRED REVIEW* Daniel (Play Melancholy Baby) turns the 1990 Las Vegas ABA convention (now known as BEA) into a murder site in this delicious sendup of the book trade. The meteoric rise of beautiful poet Heidi Yamada begins with the conversion of Guy Mallon, Santa Barbara bookstore owner, into Guy Mallon, publisher. Clever, blatant and aggressive self-promotion wins Heidi a critic here and an agent there. Add a major publishing house and a star is born. But instead of receiving a major literary award, Heidi winds up dead at the ABA (""of an apparent drug overdose,"" according to Publishers Weekly). In their eulogies, her mentor, her agent, her various publishers and the critic who first hailed her, among others, reveal the Heidi they knew. Each adds a piece of the puzzle that Mallon will eventually decipher. The author lampoons everything from the overstuffed ""collector's editions"" to the self-importance of critics and the self-interest of publishers and agents as he parades a growing list of suspects in Heidi's demise. Daniel's sharp, sardonic wit and insider's view of book industry foibles are sure to make this bibliomystery a hit. -- Publishers Weekly 2005-03-14ReviewTo paraphrase W.C. Fields' favorite irreverence, "Godfrey Daniel, this boy is good!" The Daniel here is John M., who knows how to take the shenanigans of a book convention and turn one of those basically dreary (and often depressing) occasions into a bright, funny, brain-twisting mystery.Daniel swears that the real 1990 American Booksellers confab in Las Vegas was nothing like this. But his narrator, Santa Barbara bookstore owner GuyMallon, will have none of that. For one thing, poet Heidi Yamada, who winds up dead (apparently of a drug overdose) on her hotel room bed, was not onlyMallon's lover but also the writer who made him a successful publisher.The high point of Daniel's exercise in suspenseful satire is the series of eulogies delivered at Yamada's service by a wide and woolly collection ofrecognizable book-industry types--from agents to collectors of overpriced first editions. Lots of scores are settled here, and we get to share in thenasty fun. -- Dick Adler, Chicago Tribune (5-1-2005)ReviewTo paraphrase W.C. Fields' favorite irreverence, "Godfrey Daniel, this boy is good!"

Lots of scores are settled here, and we get to share in thenasty fun. -- Dick Adler, Chicago Tribune (5-1-2005)ReviewThe annual trade show of the American Booksellers Association draws a colorful crowd--bookpeople who work the convention floor by day and attendmyriad parties by night. Though some may find Daniel's wacky characters over the top, previous attendees of the ABA (now Book Expo) show will chuckle in recognition. In fact, Daniel, a publisher himself, peppers his story with numerous references to real-life authors and publishers, and sets the action at the real-life 1990 ABA convention in Las Vegas. Publisher Guy Mallon narrates the story, which chronicles the life and untimely death of poetHeidi Yamada, whose talent for manipulating men far eclipsed her writing skill. Part of the story is set in the present, and focuses on Guy's investigation into Heidi's death--which the police are calling an accidental drug overdose. Daniel ladles plenty of tasty publishing tidbits into his narrative stew but never at the expense of the suspenseful plot. Anaffectionate look at the publishing industry fromone who clearly knows that world.  -- Jenny McLarin, BooklistSynopsisA romp rich with poetry, publishing, book collecting, and literary gossip, ""The Poet's Funeral"" is story of ego, love, art, and murder, set during four hot days at the 1990 ABA convention, and starring a cast that ranges from smalltime players to the famous Rock Bottom Remainders.About the AuthorJohn M. Daniel is a small-press literary book publisher in McKinleyville, California. He has taught fiction writing at UCLA Extension and Santa Barbara Adult Education and is on the faculty of the Santa Barbara Writers Conference. His stories have appeared in dozens of literary magazines, and he is the author of several books, including Play Melancholy Baby, a mystery, and (most recently) Generous Helpings, a story collection.

About "Daniel (John Walvoord Prophecy Commentaries Series)"


Daniel BCC - 11/28/11
 
Revised Edition of John F. ^Walvoord's Commentary
DANIEL
[sidebar
 
- Koorong


The book of Daniel is key to the entire Old Testament prophetic revelation. Who better to help you understand Daniel's stories, prophecies, and dreams and give you a brighter hope for things to come than John F. Walvoord, one of evangelicalism's most prominent leaders, and Charles Dyer, a Bible professor and expert on Israel?
In this second in a renewed series of commentaries from Dr. Walvoord, he addresses the alleged historical inaccuracies and considers past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies. At key points different views and approaches to interpretation are explored. Walvoord devotes special attention to textual and doctrinal issues while avoiding technical language. Refined, updated with the English Standard Version (ESV), and streamlined, this classic text is set to help you understand and interpret the book of Daniel and gain a better grasp of what will come in the future!
