               The North Ardmore Civic Association (NACA) was created in 1957, to protect and preserve the quality of life of homeowners in North Ardmore. The Association interacts mainly with Township government, through the Board of Commissioners, the Planning Commission, and the Zoning Hearing Board; and also with the School District, through the Board of School Directors. Two major direct services to NACA members are the annual Garden Party, held at the home of a member on a Saturday in June, and a printed Directory of Residents, issued in odd-numbered years for distribution at the Garden Party, with a printed supplement in even-numbered years. NACA members receive important e-mail notices of significant events, crimes, accidents, etc., sent to members who provide an e-mail address. An annual meeting with election of officers is held in the fall. Household dues are currently $40 per year. The Association makes annual contributions to the Ardmore Library, the Narberth Ambulance Service, and the Merion Fire Company. Special contributions have also been made to help in the purchase of open space and local parks in the Township. The NACA Board meets monthly, usually on the third Monday of the month, at 7:30 p.m. at the Merion Fire Station on Greenfield Avenue. All NACA members are welcome to attend. NACA members need not be a member of our board to attend meetings, or to help out with one of our standing committees.

Bruce C Van Arsdale Funeral Home







Flemington Warren Thaler Died at home on Monday, November 10, 2014. He was born and grew up in The Bronx. Warren waited on tables at hotels in the Catskills to pay his expenses through The City College of New York where he started out in the School of Business but then decided to change and pursue his passion for Chemistry. He graduated Cum Laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Warren received his Ph.D in Chemistry from Columbia University and went on to become a Senior Research Chemist at Exxon Research & Engineering Company. He retired from Exxon after thirty-five productive years at both the Linden and Annandale NJ sites. During that time he was the inventor or co-inventor of over ninety patents. These included commercially important gas treating patents which were implemented in refineries worldwide. Warren also made fundamental contributions to understanding the physical organic chemistry of free radical and ene reactions. The latter work was published in premier scientific journals and was often cited. Warren with his wife Harriet enjoyed many good times with the Renaissance Group they co-chaired at Temple Beth-El in Hillsborough. Warren relished in numerous diverse activities; sailing, fishing, golfing and caring for his home; landscaping, his flower garden, his aquariums, and being a general fixer upper. He extended his talents to becoming a Master Gardener of Hunterdon Somerset Counties and working with Habitat for Humanity helping to build homes for others to enjoy. He loved spending time with his granddaughter Sarah and their labradoodle, Bob. He traveled with Harriet and savored the art, music and cultures of many places. He and Harriet were long time members of The New Jersey Symphony and The Philadelphia Art Museum. Warren is predeceased by his nurturing brother Martin Thaler and his fun-loving brother in law, Marvin Raynes. Surviving are his devoted wife Harriet whom he met at her Sweet 16 Party, his loving daughters, Alaine Thaler and Lauren Berger, his precious granddaughter, Sarah Lilianna Berger, his new dear step grandchildren Jacenia & Robert Lambert and his caring sons in law, John Leonard and Scott Lambert. Also, his phone pal sister in law, Bernice Thaler and one niece and five nephews. And his many supportive friends. He led a life full of love and joy and challenges. He met those challenges buoyed by his sharp wit and excruciating puns. He was especially pleased by the Special Recognition Award he received from his Exxon colleagues for being a Master of PUNography with his unique "twists" on the English Language. His spirit will be with those who knew and loved this kind and gentle man. Shalom, Shalom, Shalom. Funeral services will be 11am on Wednesday at Temple Beth-El, 67 US Hwy 206, Hillsborough, NJ Burial at Flemington Community Jewish Center Cemetary, Capner St. Flemington, NJ. Arrangements by Bruce C. VanArsdale Funeral Home, Somerville. Memorial Contributions can be made to The Hunterdon Regional Cancer Center.
