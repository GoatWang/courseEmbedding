Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

* Mawer Fund returns are calculated after management fees and operating expenses have been deducted.** This information is not available because the Fund has not yet completed a Financial year.*** The Mawer New Canada Fund is capped to new and existing mutual fund investors. Additional units of this fund are not available for purchase.† MERs are as at December 31, 2016.†† The Fund’s MER is made up of the management fee and operating expenses. The Fund’s annual management fee is 0.60% of the Fund’s value. Because this fund is new, its operating expenses are relatively large in comparison to the fund’s assets. The management of Mawer has committed to subsidize the operating expenses of the Fund from its inception so that the MER is no more than 0.75%. Management plans to review the subsidy periodically with the intent to remove the subsidy once the MER of the Fund has stabilized from asset growth at approximately 0.75%. After the subsidized period ends the actual MER for the Fund may be higher than 0.75%.‡ Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.‡‡ As of April 30th, 2013, Morningstar will no longer calculate a Morningstar Ratings™ for money market funds.

Background
The securities regulatory authority or regulator in each of the Jurisdictions (the Decision Maker) has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions (the Legislation) for relief from the prohibition in section 13.5(2)(b) of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations against a registered adviser knowingly causing an investment portfolio managed by it, including an investment fund for which it acts as an adviser, to purchase or sell a security from or to the investment portfolio of: (i) a responsible person (ii) an associate of a responsible person or (iii) an investment fund for which a responsible person acts as an adviser, to permit:

1. the purchase and sale of securities of any issuer within a portfolio of an NI 81-102 Fund (defined below), a Pooled Fund (defined below) and a Managed Account (defined below):

(a) between an NI 81-102 Fund and (i) another NI 81-102 Fund, or (ii) a Pooled Fund;
(b) between a Pooled Fund and (i) another Pooled Fund, or (ii) an NI 81-102 Fund; or

(the purchases and sales in 1.(a), (b), and (c) are collectively referred to as the Inter-Fund Trades);
2. the Inter-Fund Trades to occur at the last sale price, as defined in the Market Integrity Rules of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, prior to the execution of the trade (the Last Sale Price) in lieu of the closing sale price contemplated by the definition of "current market price" as defined in subparagraph 6.1(1)(a)(i) of National Instrument 81-107 Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds (NI 81-107) on that trading day (the Closing Sale Price); and
(1.(a)(b) and (c), 2. are collectively the Inter-Fund Trade Relief);
3. the purchase by a Managed Account of securities of an NI 81-102 Fund or a Pooled Fund, and the redemption of securities of an NI 81-102 Fund or a Pooled Fund (each a Fund and collectively, the Funds) held by a Managed Account, and as payment:

(the purchases and redemptions in 3. and 4. are collectively referred to as the In Specie Transactions);
(3. and 4. are collectively the In Specie Relief); and
(the In Specie Relief and the Inter-Fund Trade Relief, collectively the Exemption Sought).

Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a dual application):

(a) the Alberta Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application;
(b) the Filer has provided notice that subsection 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Québec, Nova Scotia and Northwest Territories; and
(c) this decision is the decision of the principal regulator and evidences the decision of the securities regulatory authority or regulator in Ontario.

Interpretation
Terms defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions, MI 11-102, National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds (NI 81-102) and NI 81-107 have the same meanings if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined herein.
The following terms have the following meanings:

Managed Account means an account over which the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, has discretionary authority.
NI 81-102 Funds means the existing mutual funds and future mutual funds to which NI 81-102 applies, of which the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser.
Pooled Funds means the existing and future investment funds of which the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser, the securities of which are distributed pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirement.

Certain other defined terms have the meanings given to them below under Representations.
Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

The Filer
1. The Filer is a corporation organized under the laws of Alberta, with its head office in Calgary, Alberta.
2. The Filer is registered in:

(a) Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Nova Scotia and Northwest Territories as an adviser in the category of portfolio manager;
(b) Alberta as an investment fund manager; and
(c) Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario as a mutual fund dealer.

The Filer is not a member of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada.
3. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or the portfolio adviser of each of the NI 81-102 Funds and the Pooled Funds (defined above as the Funds).
4. The Filer is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada.
5. The NI 81-102 Funds are reporting issuers and as a result the Filer has established an independent review committee (IRC) under NI 81-107 with respect to each of the NI 81-102 Funds.
6. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, as investment fund manager of a Pooled Fund, will either expand the mandate of the IRC of the NI 81-102 Funds to include the review and approval of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of each Pooled Fund, or establish a new IRC for some or all of the Pooled Funds.
7. None of the Filer, an affiliate of the Filer, the NI 81-102 Funds or the Pooled Funds are in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada.
The Pooled Funds
8. Each Pooled Fund is, or will be, an investment fund established under the laws of Alberta or another jurisdiction of Canada.
9. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of each of the Pooled Funds.
10. The Pooled Funds are not, and will not be, reporting issuers in any jurisdiction of Canada.
11. Securities of the Pooled Funds are, or will be, distributed in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirement in those jurisdictions.
The NI 81-102 Funds
12. Each NI 81-102 Fund is, or will be, an investment fund established under the laws of Alberta or another jurisdiction of Canada.
13. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of each of the NI 81-102 Funds.
14. The NI 81-102 Funds are, and will be, reporting issuers in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada.
15. Securities of the NI 81-102 Funds are, or will be, distributed pursuant to a simplified prospectus and annual information form in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada.
The Managed Accounts
16. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the portfolio adviser of each of the Managed Accounts.
17. Each client of the Filer, or its affiliate, wishing to receive the investment management services of the Filer, or its affiliate, has entered into, or will enter into, a written investment management agreement (or other similar agreement) whereby the client appoints the Filer, or its affiliate, to act as portfolio adviser in connection with an investment portfolio of the client with full discretionary authority to trade in securities for the Managed Account without obtaining the specific consent of the client to execute the trade.
18. Investments in individual securities may not be appropriate in certain circumstances for a client; consequently, the Filer, or its affiliate, may, where authorized under the investment management agreement or other documentation in respect of a Managed Account, from time to time, invest the client's assets in securities of any one or more of the Funds in order to give the client the benefit of asset diversification and economies of scale regarding minimum commission charges on portfolio trades, and generally to facilitate portfolio management.
19. Each investment management agreement or other documentation in respect of a Managed Account contains, or will contain, the authorization of the client to engage in the Inter-Fund Trades and In Specie Transactions.
Inter-Fund Trades
20. As the portfolio adviser, the Filer may desire to cause:

(a) an NI 81-102 Fund to engage in an Inter-Fund Trade with (i) another NI 81-102 Fund, or (ii) a Pooled Fund;
(b) a Pooled Fund to engage in an Inter-Fund Trade with (i) another Pooled Fund, or (ii) an NI 81-102 Fund; or
(c) a Managed Account to engage in an Inter-Fund Trade with (i) an NI 81-102 Fund, or (ii) a Pooled Fund.

21. When the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, engages in an Inter-Fund Trade, it will generally follow the following procedures or other procedures approved by the applicable IRC:

(a) the portfolio adviser of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will request the approval of the chief compliance officer of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, or his or her designated alternate, or of another designated individual, to execute a purchase or a sale of a security by a Fund or Managed Account as an Inter-Fund Trade;
(b) upon receipt of the required approval, the portfolio adviser of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will either place the trade directly or deliver the trade instructions to a trader on a trading desk of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer;
(c) upon receipt of the approved trade instructions, the trader on the trading desk will have the discretion to execute the trade as an Inter-Fund Trade in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) to (g) of subsection 6.1(2) of NI 81-107, provided that, for exchange-traded securities, the Inter-Fund Trade may be executed at the Last Sale Price or the Current Market Price of the security;
(d) the policies applicable to the trading desk of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will require that all orders are to be executed on a timely basis; and
(e) the trader will advise the Filer of the price at which the Inter-Fund Trade occurred.

22. The Inter-Fund Trades will be effected through a registered dealer or otherwise be subject to market integrity requirements.
23. At the time of an Inter-Fund Trade, the Filer will have in place policies and procedures to enable the Funds and Managed Accounts to engage in the Inter-Fund Trades.
24. As noted above, the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, as investment fund manager of a Pooled Fund, will either expand the mandate of the IRC of the NI 81-102 Funds to include the review and approval of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of each Pooled Fund, or establish a new IRC for some or all of the Pooled Funds. In any event, in its review of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of a Pooled Fund, the applicable IRC will comply with the standard of care set out in section 3.9 of NI 81-107. The IRC will not approve an Inter-Fund Trade on behalf of a Pooled Fund unless the IRC has made the determination set out in subsection 5.2(2) of NI 81-107.
25. The Inter-Fund Trades involving a Fund will be referred to the IRC under subsection 5.2(1) of NI 81-107 and the Filer, as investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of such Fund, will comply with section 5.4 of NI 81-107 in respect of any standing instructions the IRC provides in connection with the Inter-Fund Trade.
26. As the Filer, or its affiliate, is, or will be, the portfolio adviser of a Fund and of the Managed Accounts, the Filer, or its affiliate, would be considered a "responsible person" within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Legislation; accordingly, absent the granting of the Exemption Sought, the Filer, or its affiliate, would be restricted from engaging in the Inter-Fund Trades.
27. The Filer cannot rely on the exemption from the trading prohibition in subsection 6.1(4) of NI 81-107 unless the parties to the Inter-Fund Trade are both reporting issuers and the Inter-Fund Trade occurs at the current market price, which in the case of exchange-traded securities, includes the Closing Sale Price but not the Last Sale Price.
28. The Filer has determined that it would be in the interests of the Funds and the Managed Accounts to receive the Inter-Fund Trade Relief.
29. Due to the various investment objectives and investment strategies utilized by the Funds and the Managed Accounts, it may be appropriate for different investment portfolios to acquire or dispose of the same securities through the same trading system; the Filer has determined that there are benefits to be achieved from expanding the potential counterparties to include other Funds and Managed Accounts; these benefits include lower trading costs, reduced market disruption and quicker execution, as well as simpler and more reliable compliance procedures.
In Specie Transactions
30. The Filer desires to be able to enter into an In Specie Transaction between a Fund and a Managed Account or between an NI 81-102 Fund or a Pooled Fund and a Pooled Fund, that permits payment, in whole or in part, for securities of a Fund purchased by a Managed Account, for securities of a Pooled Fund purchased by an NI 81-102 Fund or another Pooled Fund, or for securities of an NI 81-102 Fund purchased by a Pooled Fund, to be made by making good delivery of portfolio securities held by such Managed Account to a Fund, of portfolio securities held by such NI 81-102 Fund or Pooled Fund to a Pooled Fund, or of portfolio securities held by such Pooled Fund to an NI 81-102 Fund, in any case provided these portfolio securities meet the investment criteria of the Fund.
31. Similarly, following a redemption of securities of a Fund by a Managed Account, the redemption of securities held by an NI 81-102 Fund or a Pooled Fund in a Pooled Fund, or the redemption of securities held by a Pooled Fund in an NI 81-102 Fund, the Filer desires to be able to enter into an In Specie Transaction that permits payment, in whole or in part, of redemption proceeds to be satisfied by making good delivery of portfolio securities held in the investment portfolio of a Fund to such Managed Account, of portfolio securities held in the investment portfolio of a Pooled Fund to an NI 81-102 Fund or another Pooled Fund, or of portfolio securities held in the investment portfolio of an NI 81-102 Fund to a Pooled Fund.
32. Each In Specie Transaction involving an NI 81-102 Fund will be referred to the IRC for approval in accordance with the requirements of NI 81-107. The IRC will not approve such transaction unless it has made the determination set out in subsection 5.2(2) of NI 81-107.
33. The Filer, or its affiliate, will value the portfolio securities under an In Specie Transaction using the same values that are used to calculate the net asset value for the purpose of the issue price or redemption price of securities of the Fund.
34. The portfolio securities transferred in an In Specie Transaction will be consistent with the investment criteria of the Fund or Managed Account, as the case may be, acquiring the portfolio securities.
35. None of the portfolio securities which are the subject of an In Specie Transaction will be securities of related issuers of the Filer.
36. The Funds will keep written records of each In Specie Transaction, including records of each purchase and redemption of portfolio securities and the terms thereof for a period of five years commencing after the end of the financial year in which the trade occurred, the most recent two years in a reasonably accessible place.
37. The only cost which will be incurred by a Fund or a Managed Account for an In Specie Transaction is a nominal administrative charge levied by the custodian of the Fund in recording the trades and/or any commission charged by the dealer executing the trade.
38. The Filer has obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of the relevant client before it engages in any In Specie Transactions in connection with the purchase or redemption of securities of the Funds for a Managed Account.
39. At the time of an In Specie Transaction, the Filer, or its affiliate, will have in place policies and procedures to enable the Funds and Managed Accounts to engage in the In Specie Transactions with Funds and Managed Accounts.
40. As the Filer, or its affiliate, is, or will be, the portfolio adviser of the Funds and the portfolio adviser of the Managed Accounts, the Filer, or its affiliate, would be considered a "responsible person" within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Legislation; accordingly, absent the granting of the Exemption Sought, the Filer, or its affiliate, would be prohibited from engaging in the In Specie Transactions.
41. The Filer has determined that it would be in the interests of the Funds and the Managed Accounts to receive the In Specie Relief.
42. The Filer has determined that effecting the In Specie Transactions of securities between a Fund and a Managed Account or between a Fund and another Fund will allow the Filer to manage each asset class more effectively and reduce transaction costs for the client, as applicable, and the Funds; for example, the In Specie Transactions reduce market impact costs, which can be detrimental to clients and/or the Funds; the In Specie Transactions also allow a portfolio adviser to retain within its control institutional-size blocks of securities that otherwise would need to be broken and re-assembled.

Decision
Each of the Decision Makers is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the Decision Maker to make the decision.
The decision of the Decision Makers is that the Exemption Sought is granted provided that:

3. in connection with an In Specie Transaction where a Managed Account redeems securities in a Fund:

(a) if the transaction involves the redemption of securities in an NI 81-102 Fund, the IRC of the NI 81-102 Fund has approved the In Specie Transaction on behalf of the NI 81-102 Fund in accordance with the terms of subsection 5.2(2) of NI 81-107;
(b) the Filer and the applicable IRC comply with section 5.4 of NI 81-107 in respect of any standing instructions the applicable IRC provides in connection with the In Specie Transaction;

IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF
ALBERTA AND ONTARIO
(the Jurisdictions)
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF
APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
MAWER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LTD.
(the Filer)
DECISION
Background
The securities regulatory authority or regulator in each of the Jurisdictions (the Decision Maker) has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions (the Legislation) for an exemption from the restriction in section 4.2 of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds (NI 81-102) to permit the purchase or sale of debt securities (each purchase or sale, an Inter-Fund Trade) between an NI 81-102 Fund (as defined below) and a Pooled Fund (as defined below) (the Exemption Sought).
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a dual application):

(a) the Alberta Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application;
(b) the Filer has provided notice that section 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in all of the provinces and territories of Canada; and
(c) this decision is the decision of the principal regulator and evidences the decision of the securities regulatory authority or regulator in Ontario.

Interpretation
Terms defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions, MI 11-102, National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, NI 81-102 and National Instrument 81-107 Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds (NI 81-107) have the same meanings if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined herein.
The following terms have the following meanings:

NI 81-102 Funds means the existing mutual funds and future mutual funds to which NI 81-102 applies, of which the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser.
Pooled Funds means the existing and future investment funds of which the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser, the securities of which are distributed pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirement.
Funds means collectively, the NI 81-102 Funds and the Pooled Funds.

Certain other defined terms have the meanings given to them below under Representations.
Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

The Filer
1. The Filer is a corporation organized under the laws of Alberta, with its head office in Calgary, Alberta.
2. The Filer is registered in:

(a) Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Nova Scotia and Northwest Territories as an adviser in the category of portfolio manager;
(b) Alberta as an investment fund manager; and
(c) Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario as a mutual fund dealer.

The Filer is not a member of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada.
3. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or the portfolio adviser of each of the NI 81-102 Funds and the Pooled Funds (defined above as the Funds).
4. The Filer is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada.
5. The NI 81-102 Funds are reporting issuers and as a result the Filer has established an independent review committee (IRC) under NI 81-107 with respect to each of the NI 81-102 Funds.
6. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, as investment fund manager of a Pooled Fund, will either expand the mandate of the IRC of the NI 81-102 Funds to include the review and approval of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of each Pooled Fund, or establish a new IRC for some or all of the Pooled Funds.
7. None of the Filer, an affiliate of the Filer, the NI 81-102 Funds or the Pooled Funds are in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada.
The Pooled Funds
8. Each Pooled Fund is, or will be, an investment fund established under the laws of Alberta or another jurisdiction of Canada.
9. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of each of the Pooled Funds.
10. The Pooled Funds are not, and will not be, reporting issuers in any jurisdiction of Canada.
11. Securities of the Pooled Funds are, or will be, distributed in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirement in those jurisdictions.
The NI 81-102 Funds
12. Each NI 81-102 Fund is, or will be, an investment fund established under the laws of Alberta or another jurisdiction of Canada.
13. The Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, is, or will be, the investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of each of the NI 81-102 Funds.
14. The NI 81-102 Funds are, and will be, reporting issuers in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada.
15. Securities of the NI 81-102 Funds are, or will be, distributed pursuant to a simplified prospectus and annual information form in some or all of the jurisdictions of Canada.
Inter-Fund Trades
16. As the portfolio adviser, the Filer may desire to cause an NI 81-102 Fund to engage in an Inter-Fund Trade with a Pooled Fund.
17. When the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, engages in an Inter-Fund Trade, it will generally follow the following procedures or other procedures approved by the applicable IRC:

(a) the portfolio adviser of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will request the approval of the chief compliance officer of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, or his or her designated alternate, or of another designated individual, to execute a purchase or a sale of a security by a Fund as an Inter-Fund Trade;
(b) upon receipt of the required approval, the portfolio adviser of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will either place the trade directly or deliver the trade instructions to a trader on a trading desk of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer;
(c) upon receipt of the approved trade instructions, the trader on the trading desk will have the discretion to execute the trade as an Inter-Fund Trade in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) to (g) of subsection 6.1(2) of NI 81-107;
(d) the policies applicable to the trading desk of the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, will require that all orders are to be executed on a timely basis; and
(e) the trader will advise the Filer of the price at which the Inter-Fund Trade occurred.

18. The Inter-Fund Trades of debt securities will be executed through a registered dealer or otherwise be subject to market integrity requirements as defined in subsection 6.1(1) of NI 81-107
19. At the time of an Inter-Fund Trade, the Filer will have in place policies and procedures to enable the Funds to engage in the Inter-Fund Trades.
20. As noted above, the Filer, or an affiliate of the Filer, as investment fund manager of a Pooled Fund, will either expand the mandate of the IRC of the NI 81-102 Funds to include the review and approval of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of each Pooled Fund, or establish a new IRC for some or all of the Pooled Funds. In any event, in its review of the Inter-Fund Trades on behalf of a Pooled Fund, the applicable IRC will comply with the standard of care set out in section 3.9 of NI 81-107. The IRC will not approve an Inter-Fund Trade on behalf of a Pooled Fund unless the IRC has made the determination set out in section 5.2(2) of NI 81-107.
21. The Inter-Fund Trades involving a Fund will be referred to the IRC under subsection 5.2(1) of NI 81-107 and the Filer, as investment fund manager and/or portfolio adviser of such Fund, will comply with section 5.4 of NI 81-107 in respect of any standing instructions the IRC provides in connection with the Inter-Fund Trade.
22. Section 4.3(2) of NI 81-102 states that the restriction in section 4.2 of NI 81-102 does not apply with respect to a purchase or sale of a class of debt securities by a mutual fund from or to, another mutual fund managed by the same manager or an affiliate of the manager, if, at the time of the transaction, among other things, the mutual fund is purchasing from, or selling to, another mutual fund to which NI 81-107 applies and the transaction complies with section 6.1(2) of NI 81-107. The Filer is unable to rely on the exemption from section 4.2(1) of NI 81-102 for Inter-Fund Trades in debt securities codified in subsection 4.3(2) of NI 81-102 because the Pooled Funds are not subject to NI 81-107.
23. As the Filer, or its affiliate, is, or will be, the investment fund manager of a Fund, the Fund may be considered an "associate" of the Filer, or its affiliate, within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Legislation; accordingly, absent the granting of the Exemption Sought, the Filer, or its affiliate, would be restricted from engaging in the Inter-Fund Trades.
24. The Filer is of the view that where the portfolio securities of the selling Fund are compatible with the investment objectives and strategies of the purchasing Fund, it may be in the best interests of the applicable Funds to engage in Inter-Fund Trades involving the sale of portfolio securities from the selling Fund to the purchasing Fund. The Filer will only engage in Inter-Fund Trades between Funds if, in its view, engaging in an Inter-Fund trade as opposed to similar open-market trades is in the best interests of each of the parties to the trade.
25. Due to the various investment objectives and investment strategies utilized by the Funds, it may be appropriate for different investment portfolios to acquire or dispose of the same securities through the same trading system; the Filer has determined that there are benefits to be achieved from expanding the potential counterparties to include other Funds; these benefits include lower trading costs, reduced market disruption and quicker execution, as well as simpler and more reliable compliance procedures.

Decision
Each of the Decision Makers is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the Decision Maker to make the decision.
The decision of the Decision Makers under the Legislation is that the Exemption Sought is granted provided that:

(a) the Inter-Fund Trade is consistent with the investment objective of each of the Funds involved in the trade;
(b) the Filer refers the Inter-Fund Trade to the IRC in the manner contemplated by section 5.1 of NI 81-107 and the Filer and the applicable IRC comply with section 5.4 of NI 81-107 in respect of any standing instructions the IRC provides in connection with the Inter-Fund Trade;
(c) the IRC of each Fund has approved the Inter-Fund Trade in respect of that Fund in accordance with the terms of subsection 5.2(2) of NI 81-107; and
(d) the Inter-Fund Trade of debt securities complies with paragraphs (c) to (g) of subsection 6.1(2) of NI 81-107.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
