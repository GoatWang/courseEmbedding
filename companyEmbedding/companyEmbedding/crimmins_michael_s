Michael Crimmins





Michael Crimmins (R)





Michael Crimmins was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and raised in Larchmont. He has been a resident of San Diego since 1976. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from St. Michael's College. He received a master's degree in cross-cultural teaching and teaching educational administration from National University.
He served in the Marine Corps from 1970 to 1991, retiring with the rank of major. He served multiple deployments overseas.
He has been a teacher and principal in California schools since 1998.
He ran for Congress in 2010, losing to Democratic Rep. Susan Davis.
He is single and has one daughter.Michael Crimmins, a teacher and a retired Marine Corps major, surprised pundits by finishing second in the June 2012 primary for California's 51st Congressional District. The Democratic incumbent, Rep. Bob Filner, had announced in 2011 that he was running for San Diego mayor and would not seek an 11th term in the House.
Crimmins, a Republican, was considered a long shot in a district where Democrats held a 50-to-22 advantage in voter registration. Crimmins beat former Democratic state lawmaker Denise Ducheny by five points to earn a runoff against Democratic state Sen. Juan Vargas, the first-place finisher. Vargas used some of the $630,000 he spent on the primary on mailers to promote Crimmins, a strategy to face off against a Republican in the general election.
Crimmins' platform touched on many popular Republican themes. He said he would work to repeal the 2010 health care reform bill, calling it a "takeover of our health care and intrusion in our lives."
He championed a balanced budget and promised to fight "out-of-control" spending. The exception: he wants to increase defense spending and advocates for a third aircraft carrier at Naval Air Station North Island.
From his experience as an educator, he said he would push for vouchers that would allow families to send their children to private school.
Crimmins took a hard line on immigration in his heavily Latino district. He said employers should be required to verify the immigration status of their workers and be heavily fined if they hire anyone in the country illegally. He opposed "a path to citizenship" for illegal immigrants.
In February 2010, the San Diego County Republican Party expelled Crimmins as an ex-officio member of its central committee for supporting allegations that state party Chairman Ron Nehring physically abused a former girlfriend. Crimmins said he found the allegations, which circulated in an anonymous e-mail, to be accurate and accused another party leader of trying to get Nehring's former girlfriend fired from her job at an Indian casino.
Crimmins defeated three Republicans in a June 2010 primary for the right to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Davis to represent California's 53rd District. Davis, a five-term incumbent, won 62 percent, while Crimmins took 34 percent in the heavily Democratic district.
