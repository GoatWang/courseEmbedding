The Anderson Dolly has made our job so easy. Now it only take 2 guys to move a larger Refrigration box inside a convenience store where it used to take 5 guys.

"This is a great AV cart! It holds everything while keeping us organized! Not to mention hiding things from sight! I ordered it and had it within 3 days.(H. Wilson Mobile Audio Visual cart with Storage)."
Denise F.

I have bad knees and going up and down stairs is hard on me. I have a load of 5 to 7 computers on my old hand truck all I could think of was am I going to have enough in me to keep them from falling down the stairs. Now with the Escalera Motorized Stair Climber With Forklift Handtruck I do not worry I just let stair climber do it job with little effort on my part.

"I'm not sure this is the right place to give a review of your service for my recent order of grand piano dollies, but I wish to give an outstanding review of your service, your product, your staff member who took my order, and the delivery. Everything was as expected. I have a very high opinion of your products and service. Thanks so much!"
Mark Hurst - LBS Church

Had a great shopping experience with handtrucks2go.com! The  "Rock-n-Roller R2 No Flat Wheels" is a wonderful cart for musicians.  Loads easily, breaks down & stores readily, drives like a dream. The  ties work well with the cart, and the cart is sturdy without being  heavy. Thanks so much!
Suze Scott
Sioux Falls, South Dakota

All we do is install water heaters and the Liftkar has proven itself well beyond our expectation. Keep up the good work.
Curtis Witherspoon Water Heater Services, LLC

Best deal on the market. Love the free shipping. Very little to put together. Definitely would recommend to anyone who needs a hand truck that is convertible. The Magliner senior does everything I need it to to get the job done. It is worth it's weight in gold. It is just compact enough to fit in my suv.
Corey Bell
Lakeland, Florida


"Easy to set up ! Very sturdy, just the right size for my car, carries a whole lot of weight."
Erica K.

"Received the furniture dollie in excellent condition.  Was moving items within 5  minutes of taking it out of the box.  Dollie is excellent for moving  large heavy items around and going in and out of doors and hallways..."

Thanks for advising me to get the Wesco Rais-N-Rol Heavy Machinery Movers, they were perfect for moving the large fridge displays"
Tony H.
Boston, MA


"I used these to replace the inflatable wheels on my  Wesco Spartan Sr. The inflatable tires had worn out after light use in  just a few years.  So far, these solid rubber wheels appear likely to  last as long as the hand truck."
Ted Boggs
Raleigh , North Carolina


"That was a great deal on the oxygen cylinder Harper hand truck, delivery was real quick too. Thanks"
Robert M.
Wichita, Kansas


"I have had this cart for two weeks and have used it carting 400lbs of  tile amoung othe items. It is well made and very easy to use, locks in  place with no fear of releasing from its position. No plastic parts  here. Needless to say I am very happy with this Wesco converible hand truck."
Bill Perine
Colorado Spring, CO


"I have found that your company sells  an excellent product and stands behind everything it sells.  When I needed a replacement tire for my hand truck, you sent me one, no questions  asked.  I have found doing business with you a pleasurable experience and would  and will recommend all of my friends and family to purchase products from  your company.  Thank you for your courteous and reliable service."
Phil S

The Multi-Mover all terrain hand truck is amazing it greatly decreases the work load on the person moving the equipment.
Jake R.

"I represented South Pasadena High School, California Tiger Bingo in the  purchase of two stack-able chair hand trucks from Handtrucks2GO.  I  received excellent service and the order clerk was very courteous.  I  would recommend Handtrucks2GO to anyone; and, hope to have the  opportunity to do business with them in the future."
Steve Stellar

"The website is quick and easy. As for the hand truck it is strong and  easy to put together. I would surely order from handtrucks2go.com again."
Michael Z.

"Received my Gruvgear cart within a couple of days of ordering and it's just what I  expected.  It was easy to assemble the wheels and will be just what I  need to haul all my cases of Mardi Gras beads to the float.  See you at  the Orpheus Parade in New Orleans."
John Bryant
Port Neches, Texas


"Thanks for informing me over the phone about the Build Your Own Wesco Hand Truck, I really needed the 600lb capacity that they offered. The selection process to build the hand truck could not have been easier."
Bruce W.

Jim U.

"I own a snack food route. I needed a cart and shopped  for the best price. This site was lowest price AND FREE SHIPPING! The  cart was easy to assemble. I got a fold down front for double stacking  boxes. Works awesome. Thanks for a great product. (Magliner Snack Tuck)>"
John K.

"I love the Wesco Mini Mover Cart. I use it for my 45 lb. music amp as well as for groceries, etc. It folds up easily and fits in a corner of my car trunk. It is well built and sturdy."
Ed Hooven
Galveston, Texas


The hotel luggage platform cart was purchased for the residents who live in a 13th floor condominium building. Residents praised its ease of maneuverability and functionality. We went and purchased a second one it was so good!
Mark Goralski
Warwick, Rhode Island


"Just received the Convertible 2 to 4 wheel hand truck, I can't believe I waited so long to get it. It's a real life saver. I pushed it off for a long time cause I thought it would be like $500, but I found it on your site for less than $250 Including free delivery. The 1000 lb capacity is for real, as a matter of a fact I used it for 1200 pounds and it worked just fine too!" 
Samuel T.
Kansas City, Missouri


"I don't understand computers so thanks for the extra help you gave me in purchasing my hand truck. Thank you for your quick follow up and I of course appreciate your effort from the beginning to make sure all went well for me!"

Tom Dullanty
Federal Way, Washington


Your updated Design Your Own Service Cart was exactly what I needed! I was able to color match the cart with the theme of my office and acually buy it online wthout having to fax in the order. I am pretty sure you are the first website offering this service, I definitely haven't seen it anywhere else. It made for a great shopping experience. I will be telling everyone in my office building about your amazing site.
Coleen J.
Jackson, Mississipi


"Building my own custom BP Liberator Hand Truck was really simple and straightforward. I needed the disc brake option and I was not able to find that available anywhere else, until I found you guys. Your customizable options were the best! The final price even after I added on the accessories was cheaper then what I would have paid at my local distributor. I recommend Handtrucks2go all the way!"
 
Richard O.
Billings, Montana


"The Wesco Maxi Mover is just what it says it is: compact, heavy duty, and easy  to use.  The handle is a little shorter than might be desired, but  understandable given practical limitations.  It is a welcome alternative  to hauling around a full-sized dolly."
Virgil G.
Charleston, West Virgini


"I ordered a convertible hand truck from Handtrucks2go and it arrived just slightly damaged (but was totally usable).  When I called the customer service department they were really friendly and helpful. They gave me the choice of returning it and receiving a new one or to get a substantial discount (which is what I chose)." 
Kevin R.
Chicago, Illinois


Love our PowerPallet convertor kit. The unit went on our manual jack easily and fairly quickly. The driver delivered 18 stops before the battery started showing yellow.
Randy Martin - Dutch Valley Foods
Allentown, Pennsylvania


"This is a very heavy duty sturdy hand truck the way I built it. It is rated  for 500 lbs and will do that w/o a problem. It is slightly heavier than a  traditional cart, but it can move 3 x's the weight. I got the 10 inch  balloon tires because on previous carts we have had air filled that are a  problem; always adding air if not checked frequently and don't hold as  much weight w/o failing. I would buy another one of these when I need  one."
Joe N.
Krout, Oregon 


"In my business of running a small grocery store, I am always on the lookout for bargains. I was real glad when I found you guys. Your U-Boat Carts were priced more than $100 under the other retailers that I came across while shopping online! You have earned a steady customer."
Arthur S.
Philadelphia, PA


"I think this is a great product (R8 RocknRoller Cart) and looks as though it's going to be a great solution for me, especially with the addition of the 2-tier multimedia shelf. The product itself (R8 Multicart) seems very solid and I look forward to putting it to the test."
Brian H.
Burlington, Vermont


"Your customized Magline options were the best; I have never seen so many options on one website. Got exactly what I needed and was pretty inexpensive too."
Ben H.
Charlotte, North Carolina


"A quality truck that makes so one person can lift any move any heavy appliance! Great American made quality!! (Dual Hand Trucks)."
Wilmer Gingerich
Jamesport , Missouri


"Looked around for a while for the rock n roller carts, but had a hard time finding it with the  new no flat tires. Could be that is what the other sites were selling too, but they did not make any clear mention of it. When I hit your site, I was real happy to see a nice big picture explaining that these were the ones with the updated flat-free wheels. The onpage accessories you offered was a plus, and made the shopping experience a real pleasure."
Mike H.
San Diego, California


I can't believe how easy the Anderson Dolly makes moving appliances. We have 150 apartments that are very small. No more tilting and trying not to hit the walls and doors. One person moving made simple and fast.
Todd Hardy
Sterling Heights, Michigan


"I started off looking for a used electric pallet jack, but then I came across Handtrucks2go.com. You guys knocked me off my feet with your prices! I was able to buy a new one for the same price as a used unit."
Robert H.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa


"Thanks for helping us find the right drum dollies for our plant. They fit perfectly!"
Anthony N.
Newark, New Jersey


"Hi There, Just wanted to recommend Shragy for his help in guiding me through the buying process in acquiring my Escalera motorized stair crawler handtruck . I thought I would have to wait at least a month till I got it but I received it 7 days later. Thanks!!"
Carl M.
Portland, Maine


I have a beverage delivery route, and durability is important since I typically haul 4 to 5 cases on a single hand truck which weigh about 35lbs each. I was looking at folding hand trucks since my delivery truck is usually packed with cases leaving me with not much room for extras. My research lead me to this Magliner Folding Compact Hand Truck, and although this was by far one of the most expensive, it's also most durable. It took me a while to pull the trigger due to price, but now that I have it, I wish I wouldn't have hesitated.
Richard Alaniz
SAN MARCOS, California


Easy to assemble.  Easy to adjust.  Solid frame.  Well built.  Will probably order another.
(Digital Piano Dolly)
Steve Johansson
Hainesport, New Jersey


"The customizable Liberator Double Disk Brake hand truck is great with  the extra features – we ordered with the optional stair climber and are  so glad we did.  It’s a life saver on your back!  Anyone who does moving  or handles heavy, fragile loads will appreciate this!  Great product  and awesome service!"
Yony D.

                                    Hand Trucks 2Go Is The Only Way To Go!

 We have them all!  Just take a tour of our site and when we can assist you, please call our Customer Service Desk.



Hand carts come in many  sizes, weights, heights, and all are available on the  Handtrucks2go  website.  There are convertible models, four-wheeled hand  dollies, and  three-wheeled hand trucks, manual models and electric  models.   The  electric model provides more flexibility and is the best  option for  using on stairs, most rough terrain or curbs.
Here  are the things you  need to know to purchase the model for your home or  business.One -  Which one is best for my home/business?  Electric?   Manual? Home users should, for the most part, use  manual hand trucks.   How could a hand truck make your life easier?  It’s  the new in-home  must have accessory from Handtrucks2go! 
 Manual hand  trucks are easily used by one person and can help in many different ways   around a house.If it is for a  business, consider the kind of load you  will move and the terrain over  which there will be movement.  Are curbs  and slopes included in normal  day to day operations?  Is the load  being moved up and down stairs?   If  so, an electric hand truck will  work best for those needs.  If the  terrain is a flat surface, a manual  hand truck will work great.
Two…Which   is the best option for the space? Folding hand trucks are great if you  have space limitations,  including storage space for the hand truck  itself.  Ordinary hand trucks  are much more efficient for business use,  especially if used daily,  because the parts that fold can wear out  faster.    Folding hand trucks  are perfect for home use but not for  heavy loads like refrigerators.   Please take these needs into  consideration when ordering your new hand  truck from Handtrucks2go.com.
Three…Two  or Four Wheels? Four-wheeled hand trucks are efficient in  terms of  balance but are much more difficult to move on stairs and  curbs.  Four-wheeled hand trucks are best used for businesses that  transport  lots of moderately sized boxes on ramps, have huge warehouses  and  people that operate hand trucks solo.  Two-wheeled hand trucks are   great for home use and for companies that load boxes or stock in   vehicles, including trucks.  The two-wheeled hand truck is also great   for unloading items from your car or truck, moving them into your house   or business.
 Hand  trucks nowadays come in many forms and sizes such as convertible hand  trucks,  four-wheeled, and three-wheeled hand trucks. The problem now  is which  one to choose to optimize efficiency and cost. Some hand  trucks are  electric and can provide much more flexibility than the rest.
 Electric  or Manual?
Home  users should use  manual hand trucks. If it is for business, consider  the kind of load you  will move. One big thing to factor in is the  terrain for movement.  Consider the curbs and slopes of normal  operation. If the load will be  moved in stairs, you need to buy an electric hand truck because these products have features that allow the hand truck’s tongue   and wheels to move up and down as you control them. If the terrain is   nothing but a flat surface, all you need is a manual hand truck.
 Folding or  Ordinary?
Folding  hand trucks are  great if you have space limitations. However, folding  hand trucks are  not great for business, especially if used daily,  because they parts  that fold are likely to give up. Ordinary hand  trucks are much more  efficient for business use. Folding hand trucks  are great for home use  but not for very heavy loads like refrigerator.
 Two or Four  Wheels?
Four-wheeled  hand  trucks are efficient in terms of balance but are much more  difficult to  move in stairs and curbs. These are best used for  businesses that  transport lots of moderately sized boxes in ramps.  These businesses  normally have huge warehouses and have people operate  hand trucks solo.  Two-wheeled hand trucks are great for home use and  for companies that  load boxes or stocks in vehicles and trucks.

Testimonials




"The features of the Escalera stair climbers are  fantastic. Easy to use, good capacity, and the cell battery lasted for  about 3-4 hours of continuous use. Got if fairly quickly and the service  was excellent."
Nick J.
Lewiston, Maine


"I don't understand computers so thanks for the extra help you gave me in purchasing my hand truck. Thank you for your quick follow up and I of course appreciate your effort from the beginning to make sure all went well for me!"
Rich G.
Rohnert Park, California


"Feels like very high quality, easy to operate, quality built – what more can I say? This is a great product and really increases productivity, prevents back injury and its easy rolling design protects even the most fragile items. Fantastic product! (Motorized Stair Climber With Winch Lift)."
Tom Bofferet
Downers Grove, Illinois 


"I think this is a great product (R8 RocknRoller Cart) and looks as though it's going to be a great solution for me, especially with the addition of the 2-tier multimedia shelf. The product itself (R8 Multicart) seems very solid and I look forward to putting it to the test."
Brian H.
Burlington, Vermont


"I started off looking for a used electric pallet jack, but then I came across Handtrucks2go.com. You guys knocked me off my feet with your prices! I was able to buy a new one for the same price as a used unit."
Robert H.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa


"Hey, Just got the Bell Man Carts matches the hotel decor perfectly! The customized logo is really cool and gives our lobby a real upscale feeling!"
Jim U.

"The Wesco Spartan 3 Position Convertible Hand Truck #270391 was exactly what I needed but just a fraction of the cost of comparable products out there."
Peter K.
Bridgeport, CT


"Was a little nervous at first to design my own custom utility cart, but your site made it pretty easy and clear. Was really happy that I was able to choose my own colors to coordinate with my business office."
Debra H.
Wilmington, Delaware


Your updated Design Your Own Service Cart was exactly what I needed! I was able to color match the cart with the theme of my office and acually buy it online wthout having to fax in the order. I am pretty sure you are the first website offering this service, I definitely haven't seen it anywhere else. It made for a great shopping experience. I will be telling everyone in my office building about your amazing site.
Coleen J.
Jackson, Mississipi


"Very pleased, should have ordered the Lectro Truck 5512 years ago. Saves time and less chances of employee getting hurt on the job. We are using the Hand truck to move boiler sections weighting 350 to 450 lbs. up and down steps."
James Park Supervisor of Maintenance Carroll County Public Schools
Westminster, MD


The Multi-Mover all terrain hand truck is amazing it greatly decreases the work load on the person moving the equipment.
Jake R.
Saint Paul, Minnesota


The guy on the other side of the phone line was very helpful and got me the correct stuff. The price was right and he was very friendly. customer service was outstanding!!!
Steve Baumgarten
McHenry, Illinois


"I used these to replace the inflatable wheels on my  Wesco Spartan Sr. The inflatable tires had worn out after light use in  just a few years.  So far, these solid rubber wheels appear likely to  last as long as the hand truck."
Ted Boggs
Raleigh , North Carolina


"This is a very heavy duty sturdy hand truck the way I built it. It is rated  for 500 lbs and will do that w/o a problem. It is slightly heavier than a  traditional cart, but it can move 3 x's the weight. I got the 10 inch  balloon tires because on previous carts we have had air filled that are a  problem; always adding air if not checked frequently and don't hold as  much weight w/o failing. I would buy another one of these when I need  one."
Joe N.
Krout, Oregon 


I can't believe how easy the Anderson Dolly makes moving appliances. We have 150 apartments that are very small. No more tilting and trying not to hit the walls and doors. One person moving made simple and fast.
Todd Hardy
Sterling Heights, Michigan


"We are always on the lookout to save money for our delivery business, especially in these tough economic times. One expense that we keep on coming across is the replacements of our fleet of Magliner hand trucks, and as hard as I looked I couldn't find any discount retailers. I was really happy when I finally found Handtrucks2go, they were way cheaper than anyone else, and their build your own hand truck option was especially useful."
George P.
New York City, NY


"Building my own custom BP Liberator Hand Truck was really simple and straightforward. I needed the disc brake option and I was not able to find that available anywhere else, until I found you guys. Your customizable options were the best! The final price even after I added on the accessories was cheaper then what I would have paid at my local distributor. I recommend Handtrucks2go all the way!"
 
Richard O.
Billings, Montana


"I ordered a convertible hand truck from Handtrucks2go and it arrived just slightly damaged (but was totally usable).  When I called the customer service department they were really friendly and helpful. They gave me the choice of returning it and receiving a new one or to get a substantial discount (which is what I chose)." 
Kevin R.
Chicago, Illinois


"Just got the Jansen all-terrain dolly yesterday, of all the different dollies that I was looking at this one was the perfect one for moving my piano across the rough surfaces. Those big tires really did the trick for me. Thanks for leading me to the right one. Best deal especially with the Free Shipping."
Tom W.
New Orleans, Louisiana


"In my business of running a small grocery store, I am always on the lookout for bargains. I was real glad when I found you guys. Your U-Boat Carts were priced more than $100 under the other retailers that I came across while shopping online! You have earned a steady customer."
Arthur S.
Philadelphia, PA


"Instead of leaving a lengthy testimonial, I"ll just quickly say that this is my third time ordering form Hand Trucks 2Go. Their prices on folding hand trucks are simply the best and the customer service is outstanding!"
 John B.

Thanks for advising me to get the Wesco Rais-N-Rol Heavy Machinery Movers, they were perfect for moving the large fridge displays"
Tony H.

"I love the Wesco Mini Mover Cart. I use it for my 45 lb. music amp as well as for groceries, etc. It folds up easily and fits in a corner of my car trunk. It is well built and sturdy."
Ed Hooven
Galveston, Texas


The hotel luggage platform cart was purchased for the residents who live in a 13th floor condominium building. Residents praised its ease of maneuverability and functionality. We went and purchased a second one it was so good!
Mark Goralski

All we do is install water heaters and the Liftkar has proven itself well beyond our expectation. Keep up the good work.
Curtis Witherspoon Water Heater Services, LLC
Woodbridge, Virginia


"The Wesco Maxi Mover is just what it says it is: compact, heavy duty, and easy  to use.  The handle is a little shorter than might be desired, but  understandable given practical limitations.  It is a welcome alternative  to hauling around a full-sized dolly."
Virgil G.
Charleston, West Virgini


"When I needed 2 motorized stair climber hand trucks for my freight company, I looked around the web and found that Handtrucks2go offered the best selection and prices. When I spoke to them on the phone they were very knowledgeable, able to answer all my questions and helped me find the right equipment that fit my specific needs and budget. I highly recommend them and they will definitely be my first stop next time I need any kind of moving equipment."
Jim Hill - Hilllogistics.com
Little Rock, Arkansas


"I have had this cart for two weeks and have used it carting 400lbs of  tile amoung othe items. It is well made and very easy to use, locks in  place with no fear of releasing from its position. No plastic parts  here. Needless to say I am very happy with this Wesco converible hand truck."
Bill Perine
Colorado Spring, CO


"Hi Handtrucks2go, Your service was an excellent rating and personnel were nothing but professional In all manners. The delivery was accurate and product is in use immediately! (Escalera hand Truck) Thank you and Keep up the good work!"
Ed Button - Button Oil Company
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania


"I'm not sure this is the right place to give a review of your service for my recent order of grand piano dollies, but I wish to give an outstanding review of your service, your product, your staff member who took my order, and the delivery. Everything was as expected. I have a very high opinion of your products and service. Thanks so much!"
Mark Hurst - LBS Church
Salt Lake City, Utah


"The design your own BP Liberator was a great service and allowed our company to put together the design and features we really needed in a hand truck. Easy to configure and the step by step process was easy to follow and made sure we got just what we needed and that everything would be compatible. Thanks for the great service – looking forward to doing business again in the future!"
Frank D.

"This cart was the exact product I was looking for, the dimensions were perfect and it was well constructed. What will make me buy again is the free shipping; and I'm already looking through you website again!(Raymond Folding Chair Cart)."
Penny T.
Warren, MI


Love our Glaro Bellman Cart. Feels ultra sturdy and looks real high class. Delay in shipping but customer service was great at getting factory to push cart for sooner delivery date.
ALBERT ROBINSON
Reno , Nevada


"We needed a new dolly that would stay under the piano and organs we  deliver while moving thru doorways and up a few steps, this Jansen Piano dolly does  the job perfectly. The rubber pads keep the dolly in place under the  item and the placement of the four wheels lets the dolly angle up onto  the step or over crack in the sidewalk. Great design! Yesterday we moved  a 1000lb 7ft Baldwin Grand with ease using our new Jansen Piano Dolly.  Also thanks for your fast service, the new dolly arrived in two just  days!!"
Jeff K.
Kirk, West Virginia


"Thank you for a wonderful product at a great value  that can so easily be made to fit any theme.  Well made and loved the  options for customization.  Was also impressed at how quickly it  arrived, very happy overall.  I will definitely recommend this product  and company!"
Greg U.

"The website is quick and easy. As for the hand truck it is strong and  easy to put together. I would surely order from handtrucks2go.com again."
Michael Z.

Thanks on the great deal on the Magliner Beer Keg Lifter is a great tool for the brewery. It's a real back saver when loading kegs 3 high.
Todd Tisdell

"This stair climber is the best investment we ever made. This is our second because we wore the first one out. They work great!! Takes a lickin and keep on tickin. (Escalera Staircat)."
 Robert Vaughan
Magnolia, New Jersey


"After I visited my local hardware stores and realized that they do not stock the heavy duty aluminum hand truck I was looking for (they had a total of 3 hand trucks, lol), I realized that I will have to find it online, something I dread doing. But I was in for a surprise. I found your site right away, and once on your site, I was easily able to find exactly what I needed in a jiffy. Your prices were real fair too. You have me hooked, that's for sure."
Jeff M.
Jacksonville, FL


"Equipment and customer service could not have been better. Very helpful  in determining what equipment would fit our needs. Product support has  been great. Thank you."

Wilmer Gingerich
Jamesport , Missouri


"The Rough Terrain Dolly from Handtrucks2Go is by far a superior heavy duty dolly when compared to other dollies on the internet. By far you get what you pay for and this IS a heavy duty handtruck, that beats all other hand trucks on the Internet. I know because I use this dolly in my business all the time."
Frank Fuller
Las Vegas,  Nevada


I have bad knees and going up and down stairs is hard on me. I have a load of 5 to 7 computers on my old hand truck all I could think of was am I going to have enough in me to keep them from falling down the stairs. Now with the Escalera Motorized Stair Climber With Forklift Handtruck I do not worry I just let stair climber do it job with little effort on my part.
Todd Lindsey
SGT Bluff, Iowa


"Received the furniture dollie in excellent condition.  Was moving items within 5  minutes of taking it out of the box.  Dollie is excellent for moving  large heavy items around and going in and out of doors and hallways..."
Bruce J.
Providence, RI


"I am a DJ and have been looking around for the longest time for the perfect musicians cart, particularly I wanted one that came standard with a solid deck so the wires wouldn't fall through the cracks. I was really glad when I located one on your site-The Wesco 270389 Platform Truck With 2 Folding Handles, it was the perfect solution at a great price. Been using it for 6 months now, and it is holding up real well. Thanks!"
Ian B.
Los Angeles, CA


"Easy to set up ! Very sturdy, just the right size for my car, carries a whole lot of weight."
Erica K.
Springfield, Massachusetts


"We purchased this Snap-Loc dolly to move around our heavy tables for when we have  book sales, party reservations, etc.  We were pleased with the quick  shipment of the product and the dolly seems to be exactly what we were  needing.  Since we haven't had it very long I can't say for sure about  the durability, but I will update when and if I have other opinions."
Charlene F.
Jersey Shore, PA


"Just received the Convertible 2 to 4 wheel hand truck, I can't believe I waited so long to get it. It's a real life saver. I pushed it off for a long time cause I thought it would be like $500, but I found it on your site for less than $250 Including free delivery. The 1000 lb capacity is for real, as a matter of a fact I used it for 1200 pounds and it worked just fine too!" 
Samuel T.
Kansas City, Missouri


"Was an easy process to Build Your Own Magliner Hand Truck. I like being  able to customize my hand truck based on my needs.Was easy to  assemble.... Would recommend this site..."

What are some of the benefits of the Escalera versus other similar stair climbing hand trucks?
1) 1 year warranty vs 90 day
2) Up to 1200lb capacity vs 850 lbs
3) Modular design vs welded (allows you easily replace parts if necessary)
4) Overload protection through v-belt instead of direct drive
5) Escalera specializes in manufacturing the electric stairclimbers, so if you have any customer support needs it will be a much smoother process
6) Price Point, Because they specialize in these stair climbers they move much more volume, which gets you a much better price. Depending on the model, you will save anywhere from $500 to $1200!!
Handtrucks2go is proud to be the #1 online distributor of Escalera hand trucks. Call us today for our recommendation.

Frequenly Asked Questions about the Escalera Staircat 
Will the Escalera Staircat climb all kinds of steps?
The Escalera has a unique mechanism for stair climbing, and it adjusts automatically for varying heights of steps. You can ascend all the way up to a curb that's ten inches high, or you can go all the way down just a quarter of an inch high level. The operator won't have to do any kind of adjustment. It's fascinating to note that the Escalera will climb a high step at the same  speed that it does a low step. There are lifting cams on the Escalera that need to come around to the point that they locate a low step. Outside of just ascending thresholds, you can also climb a big crack in the sidewalk. It will just lift the wheel up, and it will hop right over the edge.
How do you manage the operation of an Escalera?
The Escalera operating instructions are placed on a decal on the cross area. Just roll the hand truck to the point that the V-belts reach the step, make sure that the lifting feet come back ground, make contact with the step, move the unit back and then hit on the switch in the up orientation. To make it go down, you move the switch in the other direction. However, you have to position the wheel in the identical place it landed on the way up. Note, it has to lift the wheels up, and then it goes over the edge, and then it's on its way down.
How fast does the Escalera climb steps?
The 700lb capacity models climb a single step once every four seconds or so. The 1,200 pound models go a little bit slower, and it climbs one step in six seconds, and so it takes around one minute for each flight of stairs.
Do I have to be concerned about the steps getting damaged when using an Escalera?
The Escalera's wheels are six inches, and they don't touch the step edges. The Escalera will land exceedingly gently on each step as it descends. There are lifting cams on the device that lift the six inch wheels up and over each edge. On the journey back up each step, they will lift the wheels up and over the edge, and they will set the wheels down in the exact same spot as they once were when it descended down in the other direction The Escalera will lift the load up and over every edge, and it will never really land on the edge. With a handtruck that's non-powered, like a normalize, the six-inch wheels would the full span all the way to each step's edge. That is the reason that you will never read about an Escalera breaking a step edge off, because it doesn't ever put any of its weight onto any step.
What is the battery life on an Escalera?
Once you've gone up approximately 78 steps fully on the way up, and then you've gone back down once more, the voltage will start to drop off. It will drop off very gently, and it will lose about a volt for each flight of steps. Once the battery voltage goes down, the Escalera will climb more slowly, and this will give the operator a kind of warning so that he can recharge the battery too.You can also get an upgraded battery which will give you almost double the life of the standard battery!
There is a gearbox on the Escalera that is very energy-efficient, and even if it has a completely dead battery, and you don't have the full amount of power to ascend the entire span of the stairway, you will never not have a good amount of power to get back down it again, so that always puts you in a safe position. There is a regular battery that comes with the Escalera, and it's a 17 amp per hour battery too. It is a leak-proof battery that is sealed, and it can be put into any orientation, and it can also be shipped through the UPS.
Will the Escalera climb on surfaces that are slippery?
There are lifting feet on the Escalera that make a pushing motion straight into the step, and they use a vertical thrust to do it. The Escalera can climb up any kind of surface. You can climb onto a three hundred pound ice block, icy curb, wet tile, and waxed wood. The Escalera can even climb up onto a step made of Teflon. The slipperiest substance that a man can make is Teflon, and that's what Escaleras can climb on. The Stair Climber is very popular in areas that are mountainous as well. The reason is that homes often have several steps. The StairClimber can go up a snow-covered or ice-covered step. There was one customer that was very proud, and he said that his Escalera could get into more places than his 4-wheel drive car could get.
What else can I do with my Escalera?
These units are extremely versatile. You can climb down and up steps. You can roll around on rough terrain. You can unload onto semi-trailers. You can unload and load onto vans or pickups. There are stack pallets too. You can also maneuver into tight quarters. Take a look at the Escalera Moving Loads Page.
How does the Escalera work?
This stairclimbing gearbox is incredibly efficient. The gearbox with just three reductions can achieve a two hundred to one ratio for the gear. We use ball-bearings and hardened gears throughout the unit. The double 4,000 lb. tested lifting chains each use a separate pair of lifting feet that are made out of soft polyurethane.
What should I do if I need parts for my Escalera?
The Escalera hand trucks are lightweight and made with a modular aluminum construction allowing for easy replacements of parts (all the moving parts are made out of steel). All of the Escalera parts are easily replaced by the field operator out in the field, and all the part orders are usually shipped out on the same day.
The Escalera StairClimber inventor had more than two decades of experience fixing typewriters, copiers, and coin machines. He made the Escalera with easy maintenance and open architecture. The full stairclimbing mechanism can be taken out for easy maintenance in a couple of minutes too.
How does the Escalera balance itself?
When you look at the video dissolve, you'll see that the balance for the Escalera is identical on the stairway, the same way it is on the ground. On a complete stairway, the Escalera operator has a lot of room to sit up in a comfortable position. The Escalera weight is distributed ideally. There is a balance point that goes directly through the middle of the load with a fulcrum point that is down near the lifting feet. On a small heavy load similar to the safe, you can accomplish the identical perfect balance lifting the load up on the forks. Once more, your center of gravity will go straight through the load with lifting feet and fulcrum point down by each other.
Will the Escalera damage the steps?
Every little thing that contacts the steps with Escalera will be soft rubber. There are soft polyurethane lifting feet, rubber V-belt glide belts, and rubber wheels. There are V-belts that maintain a touch with the step, but they don't do any lifting, and they do stop the Escalera from hurting the steps with scratches. The two lifting feet on the Escalera lay down the identical amount of pressure on the steps just like the bix six inch wheels do. The reason is that they have the same width as the wheels do, and they also have the same amount of surface area as well. It's pretty fascinating to see that a little of the older Escalera's just had one lifting foot in the center instead of the two that are on there right now. The reason that we altered it is so that the operator wouldn't need to balance the load in a direction that was sideways. There are still a number of older units as well, that are still in use, and they will work well without any damage to the steps at all.
How can I load the Escalera Hand Truck into my vehicle?
Some customers don't have a power tailgate lift, so they buy the optional portable aluminum steps. You will drill a little bit right into the tailgate inside, and the pins will go right in. There are all different sizes as well, to fit your vehicles tailgate height.
Show me the different Escalera Models. 
 
Do you need a tool to help you move extremely heavy objects like bathtubs, slot machines, gun safes, soda machines, and office equipment up and down stairs? The Escalera Stair Climber is for you then. This stair climber that operates by an electric battery motor comes either with or without a winch lift. The winch lift model is practically the same as the standard stair climber, and you have the option of getting either a non-removable, or removable forklifts.
Both versions are flexible, strong, and intuitive to use. These devices were designed to hold up for a long time, and as a matter of fact we have these units in the field for more than 20 years. The list of everything they can move is extensive. It includes speakers, lighting equipment, security safes, water tanks, and elevator equipment. The list goes on and on. These objects should give you a pretty good idea the similar items it can move though.



• Appliances• Vending machines• Slot machines• Boilers• Stoves, both wood and  house appliances
• Bathtubs• Soda machines• Large computer systems• Security safes, both  personal and business• Hot water tanks
• HVAC machinery• Office equipment• Lighting equipment• Musical equipment• Elevator equipment• Large servers
• Fireplace inserts• Gun safes• Speakers• Office equipment• Audio Visual equipment



 
The machine is akin to a robot in looks when it’s in use. With the removable forklift model, the winch detaches easily from the machine. The winch is created to easily fit in the slots that are part of wood and plastic pallets entailing small effort since the stair climber will do it all for you. You really have to see it in action to believe how strong it is, and how well it can move objects automatically. The operator doesn’t have to take any action to adjust it to the precise stair height either. It operates at just one speed, and it has six wheels that won’t ever brush, bang, or hit on steps, curbs, or anything else either. This device is the biggest and gentlest hand truck you’ll ever operate. It will automatically operate when it goes up and comes down to the curb, flights of steps, or whatever the situation calls for.
Using your Escalera is extremely easy.

Let the unit touch the step, sidewalk, or vehicle used for transporting the object.
Tilt the hand truck back a little so you can get a good center of gravity going.
Turn the switch one way for an up movement and the reverse for a downward movement.
It will automatically operate, and it will locate the step, lift, and move it up to another step.

The device will save a lot of human labor when you purchase it, and the total cost of it will be met quickly. Once that’s done with, the machine will work for many years and actually make a profit, and it will pay for itself in a short period of time.
There are options that will allow you to help the device take on any task in the warehouse, outside the warehouse, on the site, or in transport vehicles too. The Stair Climber options can be put on or taken off by the operator with just a couple of easy movements. There are 11 accessories for the machine so you should have no problem finding one that works for you.
 The most awesome stair climber is available right now. You can purchase it at Handturcks2go.com today. The Escalera MS-and MS-1 models  are very flexible, and can handle between 700-1200 pounds. It is a powerhouse! It can move your furniture, appliances, or oversized objects. Accessories are sold to make the stair climber better. Are you thinking it’s time to take a heavy load off now?

 Handtrucks2go.com is proud to present an in-depth look at how the Escalera can help you and your business save time and money!



The Escalera StairCat Stair Climbing Forklift forklift can pick up and take down safes in and out of the transport vehicle with the hand-operated, intuitive winch. You can also use a battery-powered electric winch. The forklift is 28 inches long, and it can lift up to 1200 pounds, and it can do so at a height of more than 54 inches. You can load or unload a semi-truck with no need to load a dock and a normal forklift either.




The safety strap will secure the object to your handtruck. It functions like a seat belt in your vehicle. The safety straps will rewind automatically and go inward into the sideframe if they’re not being used, so you will not need any straps idling by your feet.




Install the optional BWA-1 Big Wheel Attachment by hooking the Big Wheel frame on the bottom of the handtruck side frames. Next, with one hand, push the big wheel frame firmly against the handtruck. Raise the latch to secure the Big Wheel Attachment to the hand truck. The BWA-1 Big Wheel Attachment allows you to roll on four wheels across many types of terrain, including rough terrain such as gravel, grass, dirt or light snow.




If you need to move small, weighty safes, you can increase the center of gravity by heightening the forks, making it much easier to hold back the load. You can also put your feet on the wheel axle to help in moving the load back, and an operator can balance it easily when he is tilting it back. The safe weight will be centered evenly over the wheels. If you center the load, it makes it much easier to maneavuer it when it’s on the ground, or you are climbing up the stairs.
This battery-powered stair climber will climb more than 130 steps with a bulky load, and it is extremely gentle when it’s on the stairs too. The forklifts are sold in conjunction with the climbing system or without it, and with a hand operated or electric winch for lifting and lowering the forks.
The 28"  long forks can lift loads up to 54 inches high. This is high enough to load and unload a semi-truck. It's also great for raising a piece of equipment to the perfect height while working on it in the shop.





The forks have a space of 15 ½ inches apart for moving loads on or off the pallets. The swivel casters that are mounted underneath transform the lift to make it highly maneauverable in small spaces, and you can use an attachment to help you go over difficult terrain too The safety strap will hold the load fixedly on the handtruck for nice transport, and it will stay attached on the machine for fast and simple use. You can even get the lightweight metal portable climbing steps for getting in and out of trucks. There is a lift-hitch for taking the lift on the end of delivery trucks and service trucks too.
You can deliver objects in the most extreme locations, climb curbs with ease, roll over rough terrain like gravel, grass, dirt, bumps, and hills, one person can climb the stairs with ease, you can turn tight corners simply, stack safes in the warehouse to save space, and hold large boxes and pallets too.

These Schaff twin piano dollies work perfectly. They are of lightweight, sturdy construction with good sized casters for easy rolling, even on carpet.
Jack Schwarz
Bowling Green, Kentucky


"The Wesco Maxi Mover is just what it says it is: compact, heavy duty, and easy  to use.  The handle is a little shorter than might be desired, but  understandable given practical limitations.  It is a welcome alternative  to hauling around a full-sized dolly."
Virgil G.
Charleston, West Virgini


Best deal on the market. Love the free shipping. Very little to put together. Definitely would recommend to anyone who needs a hand truck that is convertible. The Magliner senior does everything I need it to to get the job done. It is worth it's weight in gold. It is just compact enough to fit in my suv.
Corey Bell
Lakeland, Florida


"I started off looking for a used electric pallet jack, but then I came across Handtrucks2go.com. You guys knocked me off my feet with your prices! I was able to buy a new one for the same price as a used unit."
Robert H.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa


Easy to assemble.  Easy to adjust.  Solid frame.  Well built.  Will probably order another.
(Digital Piano Dolly)
Steve Johansson
Hainesport, New Jersey


"I'm not sure this is the right place to give a review of your service for my recent order of grand piano dollies, but I wish to give an outstanding review of your service, your product, your staff member who took my order, and the delivery. Everything was as expected. I have a very high opinion of your products and service. Thanks so much!"
Mark Hurst - LBS Church
Salt Lake City, Utah


"Received my Gruvgear cart within a couple of days of ordering and it's just what I  expected.  It was easy to assemble the wheels and will be just what I  need to haul all my cases of Mardi Gras beads to the float.  See you at  the Orpheus Parade in New Orleans."
John Bryant
Port Neches, Texas


"Instead of leaving a lengthy testimonial, I"ll just quickly say that this is my third time ordering form Hand Trucks 2Go. Their prices on folding hand trucks are simply the best and the customer service is outstanding!"
 John B.
Omaha, Nebraska


I bought a  Magliner Platform Cart. There was one little glitch in what I ordered, and the salesperson called me back within an hour or two, and we straightened it out over the phone. The Magliner arrived about a week later, with no glitches, and I assembled it with no missing parts, etc.. It is one H--- of a handcart! I usually don't have time to do these reviews, but it this case, the service was so good that I think I owe it to them.
Richard Ball
Boise, Idaho


"Was a little nervous at first to design my own custom utility cart, but your site made it pretty easy and clear. Was really happy that I was able to choose my own colors to coordinate with my business office."
Debra H.
Wilmington, Delaware


Your updated Design Your Own Service Cart was exactly what I needed! I was able to color match the cart with the theme of my office and acually buy it online wthout having to fax in the order. I am pretty sure you are the first website offering this service, I definitely haven't seen it anywhere else. It made for a great shopping experience. I will be telling everyone in my office building about your amazing site.
Coleen J.
Jackson, Mississipi


"This is a very heavy duty sturdy hand truck the way I built it. It is rated  for 500 lbs and will do that w/o a problem. It is slightly heavier than a  traditional cart, but it can move 3 x's the weight. I got the 10 inch  balloon tires because on previous carts we have had air filled that are a  problem; always adding air if not checked frequently and don't hold as  much weight w/o failing. I would buy another one of these when I need  one."
Joe N.
Krout, Oregon 


"Just got the Jansen all-terrain dolly yesterday, of all the different dollies that I was looking at this one was the perfect one for moving my piano across the rough surfaces. Those big tires really did the trick for me. Thanks for leading me to the right one. Best deal especially with the Free Shipping."
Tom W.
New Orleans, Louisiana


Thanks on the great deal on the Magliner Beer Keg Lifter is a great tool for the brewery. It's a real back saver when loading kegs 3 high.
Todd Tisdell
Santa Clarita, California


"Hi Handtrucks2go, Your service was an excellent rating and personnel were nothing but professional In all manners. The delivery was accurate and product is in use immediately! (Escalera hand Truck) Thank you and Keep up the good work!"
Ed Button - Button Oil Company
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania


"Your customized Magline options were the best; I have never seen so many options on one website. Got exactly what I needed and was pretty inexpensive too."
Ben H.
Charlotte, North Carolina


"Just received the Convertible 2 to 4 wheel hand truck, I can't believe I waited so long to get it. It's a real life saver. I pushed it off for a long time cause I thought it would be like $500, but I found it on your site for less than $250 Including free delivery. The 1000 lb capacity is for real, as a matter of a fact I used it for 1200 pounds and it worked just fine too!" 
Samuel T.
Kansas City, Missouri


"The features of the Escalera stair climbers are  fantastic. Easy to use, good capacity, and the cell battery lasted for  about 3-4 hours of continuous use. Got if fairly quickly and the service  was excellent."
Nick J.
Lewiston, Maine


I have bad knees and going up and down stairs is hard on me. I have a load of 5 to 7 computers on my old hand truck all I could think of was am I going to have enough in me to keep them from falling down the stairs. Now with the Escalera Motorized Stair Climber With Forklift Handtruck I do not worry I just let stair climber do it job with little effort on my part.
Todd Lindsey
SGT Bluff, Iowa

"We have three of these round table carts for moving coaches tables for here at 
Tom Dullanty
Federal Way, Washington


Everyone in our condo are enjoying the All Plastic Shopping Carts. The service was great. Carts look good.  Thank you.
Jordan Lesemann
Miami, Florida


I have a beverage delivery route, and durability is important since I typically haul 4 to 5 cases on a single hand truck which weigh about 35lbs each. I was looking at folding hand trucks since my delivery truck is usually packed with cases leaving me with not much room for extras. My research lead me to this Magliner Folding Compact Hand Truck, and although this was by far one of the most expensive, it's also most durable. It took me a while to pull the trigger due to price, but now that I have it, I wish I wouldn't have hesitated.
Richard Alaniz
SAN MARCOS, California


"Thanks for informing me over the phone about the Build Your Own Wesco Hand Truck, I really needed the 600lb capacity that they offered. The selection process to build the hand truck could not have been easier."
Bruce W.
West Valley , Utah


Love our Glaro Bellman Cart. Feels ultra sturdy and looks real high class. Delay in shipping but customer service was great at getting factory to push cart for sooner delivery date.
ALBERT ROBINSON

"Thanks for helping us find the right drum dollies for our plant. They fit perfectly!"
Anthony N.
Newark, New Jersey


"I am a DJ and have been looking around for the longest time for the perfect musicians cart, particularly I wanted one that came standard with a solid deck so the wires wouldn't fall through the cracks. I was really glad when I located one on your site-The Wesco 270389 Platform Truck With 2 Folding Handles, it was the perfect solution at a great price. Been using it for 6 months now, and it is holding up real well. Thanks!"
Ian B.
Los Angeles, CA


"I love the Wesco Mini Mover Cart. I use it for my 45 lb. music amp as well as for groceries, etc. It folds up easily and fits in a corner of my car trunk. It is well built and sturdy."
Ed Hooven

Thanks for advising me to get the Wesco Rais-N-Rol Heavy Machinery Movers, they were perfect for moving the large fridge displays"
Tony H.
Boston, MA


"We purchased this Snap-Loc dolly to move around our heavy tables for when we have  book sales, party reservations, etc.  We were pleased with the quick  shipment of the product and the dolly seems to be exactly what we were  needing.  Since we haven't had it very long I can't say for sure about  the durability, but I will update when and if I have other opinions."
Charlene F.
Jersey Shore, PA


"A quality truck that makes so one person can lift any move any heavy appliance! Great American made quality!! (Dual Hand Trucks)."
Wilmer Gingerich
Jamesport , Missouri


"I used these to replace the inflatable wheels on my  Wesco Spartan Sr. The inflatable tires had worn out after light use in  just a few years.  So far, these solid rubber wheels appear likely to  last as long as the hand truck."
Ted Boggs
Raleigh , North Carolina


"The Chair carts arrived at our wedding hall yesterday, we were able to assemble them very easily as you said."
Kathy D.

"Thanks for advising us to get the Luxor janitor cart instead of the Rubbermaid Commercial one. Looks like great quality and saved us a bundle"
Don R.

I can't believe how easy the Anderson Dolly makes moving appliances. We have 150 apartments that are very small. No more tilting and trying not to hit the walls and doors. One person moving made simple and fast.

Mary A.
Minneapolis, Minnesota


"Just wanted to drop a quick thank you for the beautiful folding office cart that we received last week. In the short time that we've had it, it has already more than paid for itself. I would like to place an order for another 2 for my  billing and accounts receivables departments as well..."

S. Christopher

"I am a caterer and I am constantly transporting  dishes and cups which come in those wide crates. I ordered the folding  nose option with stair climbers and it is working out great. Handtruck  came quick enough (about 6 days), feels real solid. Would buy again and  recommend it for other people in the food industry."

Moshe Green
Lakewood, NJ


"After I visited my local hardware stores and realized that they do not stock the heavy duty aluminum hand truck I was looking for (they had a total of 3 hand trucks, lol), I realized that I will have to find it online, something I dread doing. But I was in for a surprise. I found your site right away, and once on your site, I was easily able to find exactly what I needed in a jiffy. Your prices were real fair too. You have me hooked, that's for sure."
Jeff M.
Jacksonville, FL


I must tell you how favorably impressed I was with your courteous, professional and proficient service today.  I had just spent one and one-half hours on the telephone trying to locate the part I needed  - the 5-inch caster wheel for my hand-truck cart.  I was sent to a telephone number, another company, then another telephone number and another company...and so it continued. 
Finally, I reached the gentlemen at your company who assisted me - so very expertly.  I am not known for rendering accolades to anyone, but in this case the gentleman who assisted me is worthy of high recognition.  Your company is exceptionally fortunate to have him as one of your employees.
Kenneth Liechty
Fleming Island, Florida


"I have had this cart for two weeks and have used it carting 400lbs of  tile amoung othe items. It is well made and very easy to use, locks in  place with no fear of releasing from its position. No plastic parts  here. Needless to say I am very happy with this Wesco converible hand truck."
Bill Perine

Had a great shopping experience with handtrucks2go.com! The  "Rock-n-Roller R2 No Flat Wheels" is a wonderful cart for musicians.  Loads easily, breaks down & stores readily, drives like a dream. The  ties work well with the cart, and the cart is sturdy without being  heavy. Thanks so much!

Howie A.

"Building my own custom BP Liberator Hand Truck was really simple and straightforward. I needed the disc brake option and I was not able to find that available anywhere else, until I found you guys. Your customizable options were the best! The final price even after I added on the accessories was cheaper then what I would have paid at my local distributor. I recommend Handtrucks2go all the way!"

I have bad knees and going up and down stairs is hard on me. I have a load of 5 to 7 computers on my old hand truck all I could think of was am I going to have enough in me to keep them from falling down the stairs. Now with the Escalera Motorized Stair Climber With Forklift Handtruck I do not worry I just let stair climber do it job with little effort on my part.
Todd Lindsey
SGT Bluff, Iowa


"Really appreciated your patience in taking the time out to ensure I got the right Piano Dolly."
Bill H.
Indianapolis, Indiana


"I used these to replace the inflatable wheels on my  Wesco Spartan Sr. The inflatable tires had worn out after light use in  just a few years.  So far, these solid rubber wheels appear likely to  last as long as the hand truck."
Ted Boggs
Raleigh , North Carolina


"Hi There, Just wanted to recommend Shragy for his help in guiding me through the buying process in acquiring my Escalera motorized stair crawler handtruck . I thought I would have to wait at least a month till I got it but I received it 7 days later. Thanks!!"
Carl M.
Portland, Maine


"The customizable Liberator Double Disk Brake hand truck is great with  the extra features – we ordered with the optional stair climber and are  so glad we did.  It’s a life saver on your back!  Anyone who does moving  or handles heavy, fragile loads will appreciate this!  Great product  and awesome service!"
Yony D.
Dover, Delaware


"Building my own custom BP Liberator Hand Truck was really simple and straightforward. I needed the disc brake option and I was not able to find that available anywhere else, until I found you guys. Your customizable options were the best! The final price even after I added on the accessories was cheaper then what I would have paid at my local distributor. I recommend Handtrucks2go all the way!"
 
Richard O.
Billings, Montana


The guy on the other side of the phone line was very helpful and got me the correct stuff. The price was right and he was very friendly. customer service was outstanding!!!
Steve Baumgarten
McHenry, Illinois


"I don't understand computers so thanks for the extra help you gave me in purchasing my hand truck. Thank you for your quick follow up and I of course appreciate your effort from the beginning to make sure all went well for me!"
Rich G.
Rohnert Park, California


"The Wesco Spartan 3 Position Convertible Hand Truck #270391 was exactly what I needed but just a fraction of the cost of comparable products out there."
Peter K.
Bridgeport, CT


"Looked around for a while for the rock n roller carts, but had a hard time finding it with the  new no flat tires. Could be that is what the other sites were selling too, but they did not make any clear mention of it. When I hit your site, I was real happy to see a nice big picture explaining that these were the ones with the updated flat-free wheels. The onpage accessories you offered was a plus, and made the shopping experience a real pleasure."
Mike H.
San Diego, California


Everyone in our condo are enjoying the All Plastic Shopping Carts. The service was great. Carts look good.  Thank you.
Jordan Lesemann
Miami, Florida


"Easy to set up ! Very sturdy, just the right size for my car, carries a whole lot of weight."
Erica K.
Springfield, Massachusetts


"The Wesco Maxi Mover is just what it says it is: compact, heavy duty, and easy  to use.  The handle is a little shorter than might be desired, but  understandable given practical limitations.  It is a welcome alternative  to hauling around a full-sized dolly."
Virgil G.
Charleston, West Virgini


Thanks on the great deal on the Magliner Beer Keg Lifter is a great tool for the brewery. It's a real back saver when loading kegs 3 high.
Todd Tisdell
Santa Clarita, California


"I am a caterer and I am constantly transporting  dishes and cups which come in those wide crates. I ordered the folding  nose option with stair climbers and it is working out great. Handtruck  came quick enough (about 6 days), feels real solid. Would buy again and  recommend it for other people in the food industry."

Moshe Green
Lakewood, NJ


"I own a snack food route. I needed a cart and shopped  for the best price. This site was lowest price AND FREE SHIPPING! The  cart was easy to assemble. I got a fold down front for double stacking  boxes. Works awesome. Thanks for a great product. (Magliner Snack Tuck)>"
John K.
Austin, Texas


Best deal on the market. Love the free shipping. Very little to put together. Definitely would recommend to anyone who needs a hand truck that is convertible. The Magliner senior does everything I need it to to get the job done. It is worth it's weight in gold. It is just compact enough to fit in my suv.
Corey Bell
Lakeland, Florida


"Feels like very high quality, easy to operate, quality built – what more can I say? This is a great product and really increases productivity, prevents back injury and its easy rolling design protects even the most fragile items. Fantastic product! (Motorized Stair Climber With Winch Lift)."
Tom Bofferet
Downers Grove, Illinois 


This is our 3rd hand truck we have purchased from Handtrucks2go.com. As our company continues to grow so does our need for more handtrucks.
(Wesco Spartan Senior)
Samantha Rougeux
Hopewell Junction, New York


"This is a great AV cart! It holds everything while keeping us organized! Not to mention hiding things from sight! I ordered it and had it within 3 days.(H. Wilson Mobile Audio Visual cart with Storage)."
Denise F.
Bethsedea, Maryland


"I think this is a great product (R8 RocknRoller Cart) and looks as though it's going to be a great solution for me, especially with the addition of the 2-tier multimedia shelf. The product itself (R8 Multicart) seems very solid and I look forward to putting it to the test."
Brian H.
Burlington, Vermont


"That was a great deal on the oxygen cylinder Harper hand truck, delivery was real quick too. Thanks"
Robert M.
Wichita, Kansas


"This cart was the exact product I was looking for, the dimensions were perfect and it was well constructed. What will make me buy again is the free shipping; and I'm already looking through you website again!(Raymond Folding Chair Cart)."
Penny T.
Warren, MI


"I own a mom and pop shop where we sell all kinds of appliances. Buying the appliance trucks was always an ordeal that I did not look forward to. That is until I found you guys. Your sales rep Shragy was really helpful over the phone. He knew right away exactly what I wanted and gave me three options in different price ranges. In all my years that I have been shopping for these appliance hand trucks, this was by far my best experience ever!"
Harry R. 
Baltimore, MD


"Your customized Magline options were the best; I have never seen so many options on one website. Got exactly what I needed and was pretty inexpensive too."
Ben H.
Charlotte, North Carolina


"The features of the Escalera stair climbers are  fantastic. Easy to use, good capacity, and the cell battery lasted for  about 3-4 hours of continuous use. Got if fairly quickly and the service  was excellent."
Nick J.
Lewiston, Maine


"A quality truck that makes so one person can lift any move any heavy appliance! Great American made quality!! (Dual Hand Trucks)."
Wilmer Gingerich
Jamesport , Missouri


I have a beverage delivery route, and durability is important since I typically haul 4 to 5 cases on a single hand truck which weigh about 35lbs each. I was looking at folding hand trucks since my delivery truck is usually packed with cases leaving me with not much room for extras. My research lead me to this Magliner Folding Compact Hand Truck, and although this was by far one of the most expensive, it's also most durable. It took me a while to pull the trigger due to price, but now that I have it, I wish I wouldn't have hesitated.
Richard Alaniz
SAN MARCOS, California


"The Rough Terrain Dolly from Handtrucks2Go is by far a superior heavy duty dolly when compared to other dollies on the internet. By far you get what you pay for and this IS a heavy duty handtruck, that beats all other hand trucks on the Internet. I know because I use this dolly in my business all the time."
Frank Fuller
Las Vegas,  Nevada


"I am a DJ and have been looking around for the longest time for the perfect musicians cart, particularly I wanted one that came standard with a solid deck so the wires wouldn't fall through the cracks. I was really glad when I located one on your site-The Wesco 270389 Platform Truck With 2 Folding Handles, it was the perfect solution at a great price. Been using it for 6 months now, and it is holding up real well. Thanks!"
Ian B.
Los Angeles, CA


The Anderson Dolly has made our job so easy. Now it only take 2 guys to move a larger Refrigration box inside a convenience store where it used to take 5 guys.
Michael Cancel
El Cajon, California


"I'm not sure this is the right place to give a review of your service for my recent order of grand piano dollies, but I wish to give an outstanding review of your service, your product, your staff member who took my order, and the delivery. Everything was as expected. I have a very high opinion of your products and service. Thanks so much!"
Mark Hurst - LBS Church
Salt Lake City, Utah


"The piano dollies are easy to install and support evenly the weight of  the instrument making it easy to move around.  The size of the wheels  make it easy to roll and do not leave an impression in floor tiles like  some piano wheels would do.  I am very happy with the product and the  timeliness of the customer service received."
Glen Bohannon
Manchester, New Hampshire


"We have three of these round table carts for moving coaches tables for here at 
Tom Dullanty
Federal Way, Washington


"When I needed 2 motorized stair climber hand trucks for my freight company, I looked around the web and found that Handtrucks2go offered the best selection and prices. When I spoke to them on the phone they were very knowledgeable, able to answer all my questions and helped me find the right equipment that fit my specific needs and budget. I highly recommend them and they will definitely be my first stop next time I need any kind of moving equipment."
Jim Hill - Hilllogistics.com
Little Rock, Arkansas


"Ordered a small hand cart, it was delivered promptly and was easy to assemble; instructions called for 8 washers but only 6 were provided. When I called for more, the service was excellent and the washers came in a day or so. Hand truck seems solid - but pins holding handle tend to work their way loose - not a big problem, though."
William McCutcheon
Milwaukee, Wisconsin


Thanks for advising me to get the Wesco Rais-N-Rol Heavy Machinery Movers, they were perfect for moving the large fridge displays"
Tony H.
Boston, MA


"Just received the Convertible 2 to 4 wheel hand truck, I can't believe I waited so long to get it. It's a real life saver. I pushed it off for a long time cause I thought it would be like $500, but I found it on your site for less than $250 Including free delivery. The 1000 lb capacity is for real, as a matter of a fact I used it for 1200 pounds and it worked just fine too!" 
Samuel T.
Kansas City, Missouri


I can't believe how easy the Anderson Dolly makes moving appliances. We have 150 apartments that are very small. No more tilting and trying not to hit the walls and doors. One person moving made simple and fast.
Todd Hardy
Sterling Heights, Michigan


"The rolling file cart dollie was extremely lightweight but still nice and durable. Just like you said it would be!"
Mary A.
Minneapolis, Minnesota


"After I visited my local hardware stores and realized that they do not stock the heavy duty aluminum hand truck I was looking for (they had a total of 3 hand trucks, lol), I realized that I will have to find it online, something I dread doing. But I was in for a surprise. I found your site right away, and once on your site, I was easily able to find exactly what I needed in a jiffy. Your prices were real fair too. You have me hooked, that's for sure."
Jeff M.
Jacksonville, FL


"Hey, Just got the Bell Man Carts matches the hotel decor perfectly! The customized logo is really cool and gives our lobby a real upscale feeling!"
Jim U.
Tulsa, Oklahoma


These Schaff twin piano dollies work perfectly. They are of lightweight, sturdy construction with good sized casters for easy rolling, even on carpet.
Jack Schwarz
Bowling Green, Kentucky


"We needed a new dolly that would stay under the piano and organs we  deliver while moving thru doorways and up a few steps, this Jansen Piano dolly does  the job perfectly. The rubber pads keep the dolly in place under the  item and the placement of the four wheels lets the dolly angle up onto  the step or over crack in the sidewalk. Great design! Yesterday we moved  a 1000lb 7ft Baldwin Grand with ease using our new Jansen Piano Dolly.  Also thanks for your fast service, the new dolly arrived in two just  days!!"
Jeff K.
Kirk, West Virginia


All we do is install water heaters and the Liftkar has proven itself well beyond our expectation. Keep up the good work.
Curtis Witherspoon Water Heater Services, LLC
Woodbridge, Virginia


"This stair climber is the best investment we ever made. This is our second because we wore the first one out. They work great!! Takes a lickin and keep on tickin. (Escalera Staircat)."
 Robert Vaughan
Magnolia, New Jersey


"The Magliner brake truck arrived in no time at all, thanks for instantly emailing me  the assembly instructios (that I misplaced). Really great customer service!"
Howie A.
Norfolk, Virginia


"I love the Wesco Mini Mover Cart. I use it for my 45 lb. music amp as well as for groceries, etc. It folds up easily and fits in a corner of my car trunk. It is well built and sturdy."
Ed Hooven
Galveston, Texas


The hotel luggage platform cart was purchased for the residents who live in a 13th floor condominium building. Residents praised its ease of maneuverability and functionality. We went and purchased a second one it was so good!
Mark Goralski
Warwick, Rhode Island


"Equipment and customer service could not have been better. Very helpful  in determining what equipment would fit our needs. Product support has  been great. Thank you."

The chair cart is used to move folding chairs such as a resin folding, a plastic folding, a wood chair, or stacking chairs. Most chair carts have four wheels and are able to accommodate at least 80 pieces of folding chairs, 45 stackable chairs. Chair dollies come in handy during a big event which requires a lot of chairs while the event is taking place.
 Since the tasks of setting up and clearing up at any events can cause a major hassle to any event coordinator or event administrator, stackable chair carts can be really useful and it would be ridiculous and tiresome to carry lots of heavy chairs back and forth on your own. There are wide selections of durable ones available in the market for you to choose from depending on your needs. 
Chair carts may be different from each other in terms of its sizes and styles. Most chair carts are safe to be loaded, transported, and even used to store your folding chairs. Some have been painstakingly constructed to accommodate heavy loads and to be able to withstand many years of use. Chair carts are typically designed to hold mostly plastic or metal chairs with varying sizes, and chair carts are able to store chairs either in an upright position, a vertical position, or even in a horizontal flat position.
 Most chair carts are also equipped with storage kits or optional inserts which are able to accommodate additional chairs. By having this kind of option, you will be able to cut cost rather than having to purchase another two chair carts that are different in terms of its capabilities and sizes.
 Among the styles of chair carts available in the market that are mostly used by event coordinators and administrators include the Vertical Storage Folding Chair Cart (VSFCC), the Plastic Folding Chair Cart (PFCC), and the Chair Trucks Folding Chairs Hanging (CTFCH). The VSFCC has a solid construction, is able to transport and hold folding chairs in upright position, is equipped with 2 swivels, 4 castors, 3 tubular handles and 2 stationeries, and was made of powder-coated steel. The PFCC is perfect to store plastic chairs, has the features of ‘L’ shaped angled steel and the front wheels’ ability to swivel for fuss-free handling, has the abilities to stack up to 36 chairs and fit through a standard and conventional-height door. Meanwhile, the CTFCH is equipped with 4 swivel casters which are 4 inches each in diameter, industrial plastic wheels, 1 inch by 2 inches steel tube frame with 1 inch diameter, and hanging rods. The CTFCH is also able to hold high-back chairs and is 72 inches tall.

Testimonials




"The features of the Escalera stair climbers are  fantastic. Easy to use, good capacity, and the cell battery lasted for  about 3-4 hours of continuous use. Got if fairly quickly and the service  was excellent."
Nick J.
Lewiston, Maine


"Thanks for informing me over the phone about the Build Your Own Wesco Hand Truck, I really needed the 600lb capacity that they offered. The selection process to build the hand truck could not have been easier."
Bruce W.
West Valley , Utah


"Great selection of hydraulic stacker lift trucks, was able to find exactly what I needed."
Howard W.
Detroit, Michigan


"The customizable Liberator Double Disk Brake hand truck is great with  the extra features – we ordered with the optional stair climber and are  so glad we did.  It’s a life saver on your back!  Anyone who does moving  or handles heavy, fragile loads will appreciate this!  Great product  and awesome service!"
Yony D.
Dover, Delaware


"The Wesco Heavy Duty Electric Pallet Jacks were exactly what I needed, thanks for your help."
Paul O. 
Seattle, Washington


I bought a  Magliner Platform Cart. There was one little glitch in what I ordered, and the salesperson called me back within an hour or two, and we straightened it out over the phone. The Magliner arrived about a week later, with no glitches, and I assembled it with no missing parts, etc.. It is one H--- of a handcart! I usually don't have time to do these reviews, but it this case, the service was so good that I think I owe it to them.
Richard Ball
Boise, Idaho


"Thanks for advising us to get the Luxor janitor cart instead of the Rubbermaid Commercial one. Looks like great quality and saved us a bundle"
Don R.
Denver, Colorado


"The Chair carts arrived at our wedding hall yesterday, we were able to assemble them very easily as you said."
Kathy D.
Columbus, Ohio


"Really appreciated your patience in taking the time out to ensure I got the right Piano Dolly."
Bill H.
Indianapolis, Indiana


"We needed a new dolly that would stay under the piano and organs we  deliver while moving thru doorways and up a few steps, this Jansen Piano dolly does  the job perfectly. The rubber pads keep the dolly in place under the  item and the placement of the four wheels lets the dolly angle up onto  the step or over crack in the sidewalk. Great design! Yesterday we moved  a 1000lb 7ft Baldwin Grand with ease using our new Jansen Piano Dolly.  Also thanks for your fast service, the new dolly arrived in two just  days!!"
Jeff K.
Kirk, West Virginia


"Ordered a small hand cart, it was delivered promptly and was easy to assemble; instructions called for 8 washers but only 6 were provided. When I called for more, the service was excellent and the washers came in a day or so. Hand truck seems solid - but pins holding handle tend to work their way loose - not a big problem, though."
William McCutcheon
Milwaukee, Wisconsin


"Hi There, Just wanted to recommend Shragy for his help in guiding me through the buying process in acquiring my Escalera motorized stair crawler handtruck . I thought I would have to wait at least a month till I got it but I received it 7 days later. Thanks!!"
Carl M.

Love our Glaro Bellman Cart. Feels ultra sturdy and looks real high class. Delay in shipping but customer service was great at getting factory to push cart for sooner delivery date.

Tom Dullanty

Ed Button - Button Oil Company
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania


"I am a caterer and I am constantly transporting  dishes and cups which come in those wide crates. I ordered the folding  nose option with stair climbers and it is working out great. Handtruck  came quick enough (about 6 days), feels real solid. Would buy again and  recommend it for other people in the food industry."

Moshe Green
Lakewood, NJ


"When I needed 2 motorized stair climber hand trucks for my freight company, I looked around the web and found that Handtrucks2go offered the best selection and prices. When I spoke to them on the phone they were very knowledgeable, able to answer all my questions and helped me find the right equipment that fit my specific needs and budget. I highly recommend them and they will definitely be my first stop next time I need any kind of moving equipment."
Jim Hill - Hilllogistics.com

Love our PowerPallet convertor kit. The unit went on our manual jack easily and fairly quickly. The driver delivered 18 stops before the battery started showing yellow.
Randy Martin - Dutch Valley Foods

Erica K.

"Just got the Jansen all-terrain dolly yesterday, of all the different dollies that I was looking at this one was the perfect one for moving my piano across the rough surfaces. Those big tires really did the trick for me. Thanks for leading me to the right one. Best deal especially with the Free Shipping."

"In my business of running a small grocery store, I am always on the lookout for bargains. I was real glad when I found you guys. Your U-Boat Carts were priced more than $100 under the other retailers that I came across while shopping online! You have earned a steady customer."
Arthur S.
Philadelphia, PA


Had a great shopping experience with handtrucks2go.com! The  "Rock-n-Roller R2 No Flat Wheels" is a wonderful cart for musicians.  Loads easily, breaks down & stores readily, drives like a dream. The  ties work well with the cart, and the cart is sturdy without being  heavy. Thanks so much!
Suze Scott
Sioux Falls, South Dakota


"Feels like very high quality, easy to operate, quality built – what more can I say? This is a great product and really increases productivity, prevents back injury and its easy rolling design protects even the most fragile items. Fantastic product! (Motorized Stair Climber With Winch Lift)."
Tom Bofferet
Downers Grove, Illinois 


"This is a very heavy duty sturdy hand truck the way I built it. It is rated  for 500 lbs and will do that w/o a problem. It is slightly heavier than a  traditional cart, but it can move 3 x's the weight. I got the 10 inch  balloon tires because on previous carts we have had air filled that are a  problem; always adding air if not checked frequently and don't hold as  much weight w/o failing. I would buy another one of these when I need  one."
Joe N.
Krout, Oregon 


"Thanks for helping us find the right drum dollies for our plant. They fit perfectly!"
Anthony N.
Newark, New Jersey


"I own a snack food route. I needed a cart and shopped  for the best price. This site was lowest price AND FREE SHIPPING! The  cart was easy to assemble. I got a fold down front for double stacking  boxes. Works awesome. Thanks for a great product. (Magliner Snack Tuck)>"
John K.
Austin, Texas


"The design your own BP Liberator was a great service and allowed our company to put together the design and features we really needed in a hand truck. Easy to configure and the step by step process was easy to follow and made sure we got just what we needed and that everything would be compatible. Thanks for the great service – looking forward to doing business again in the future!"
Frank D.

"Was an easy process to Build Your Own Magliner Hand Truck. I like being  able to customize my hand truck based on my needs.Was easy to  assemble.... Would recommend this site..."
S. Christopher
Carmichaels, Pennsylvania


"I have had this cart for two weeks and have used it carting 400lbs of  tile amoung othe items. It is well made and very easy to use, locks in  place with no fear of releasing from its position. No plastic parts  here. Needless to say I am very happy with this Wesco converible hand truck."
Bill Perine
Colorado Spring, CO


"Looked around for a while for the rock n roller carts, but had a hard time finding it with the  new no flat tires. Could be that is what the other sites were selling too, but they did not make any clear mention of it. When I hit your site, I was real happy to see a nice big picture explaining that these were the ones with the updated flat-free wheels. The onpage accessories you offered was a plus, and made the shopping experience a real pleasure."
Mike H.
San Diego, California


"I am a DJ and have been looking around for the longest time for the perfect musicians cart, particularly I wanted one that came standard with a solid deck so the wires wouldn't fall through the cracks. I was really glad when I located one on your site-The Wesco 270389 Platform Truck With 2 Folding Handles, it was the perfect solution at a great price. Been using it for 6 months now, and it is holding up real well. Thanks!"
Ian B.

Thanks for advising me to get the Wesco Rais-N-Rol Heavy Machinery Movers, they were perfect for moving the large fridge displays"
Tony H.

"I own a mom and pop shop where we sell all kinds of appliances. Buying the appliance trucks was always an ordeal that I did not look forward to. That is until I found you guys. Your sales rep Shragy was really helpful over the phone. He knew right away exactly what I wanted and gave me three options in different price ranges. In all my years that I have been shopping for these appliance hand trucks, this was by far my best experience ever!"
Harry R.

All we do is install water heaters and the Liftkar has proven itself well beyond our expectation. Keep up the good work.
Curtis Witherspoon Water Heater Services, LLC

"Received the furniture dollie in excellent condition.  Was moving items within 5  minutes of taking it out of the box.  Dollie is excellent for moving  large heavy items around and going in and out of doors and hallways..."
Bruce J.

"Very pleased, should have ordered the Lectro Truck 5512 years ago. Saves time and less chances of employee getting hurt on the job. We are using the Hand truck to move boiler sections weighting 350 to 450 lbs. up and down steps."
James Park Supervisor of Maintenance Carroll County Public Schools

The Pro-Paw power wheelbarrow was easy to put together and I operate out of a wheel chair! It's a real life saver, I feel like I got my feet back again.

Very happy with the purchase of the Wesco pedal lift stacker. Great lightweight and versatile pedal lift. Was priced right and the service was great.
Dan Burns
Great Falls, Montana


I must tell you how favorably impressed I was with your courteous, professional and proficient service today.  I had just spent one and one-half hours on the telephone trying to locate the part I needed  - the 5-inch caster wheel for my hand-truck cart.  I was sent to a telephone number, another company, then another telephone number and another company...and so it continued. 
Finally, I reached the gentlemen at your company who assisted me - so very expertly.  I am not known for rendering accolades to anyone, but in this case the gentleman who assisted me is worthy of high recognition.  Your company is exceptionally fortunate to have him as one of your employees.
Kenneth Liechty
Fleming Island, Florida


Everyone in our condo are enjoying the All Plastic Shopping Carts. The service was great. Carts look good.  Thank you.
Jordan Lesemann
Miami, Florida


"I think this is a great product (R8 RocknRoller Cart) and looks as though it's going to be a great solution for me, especially with the addition of the 2-tier multimedia shelf. The product itself (R8 Multicart) seems very solid and I look forward to putting it to the test."
