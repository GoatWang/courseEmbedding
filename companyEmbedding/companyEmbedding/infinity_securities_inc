At Infinity Financial Concepts we understand the anxiety you may have about the fear of the unknown.  Our goal is to take the uncertainty out of the retirement process and help guide you through the complex and ever changing world of retirement programs and rules. We specialize in retirement income planning in the Chicagoland area with over twenty-five years of experience.
Infinity Financial Concepts Advisors are independent financial advisors affiliated with Securities America Advisors Inc.  As independent advisors we do not have limitations or requirements to use any specific investment product or solution; this allows us to create customized financial plans designed to provide income and growth for our clients.
We firmly believe that it is our responsibility to help educate our clients about all the aspects of their retirement.  Creating a "Nest Egg" for your retirement years is extremely important.  We educate and guide you through your pre-retirement years to help you focus on establishing enough resources for retirement.
Our process is comprehensive.  It is Education-Based, Client Driven and Income Focused.

How long will I have to work?  Will I ever be able to retire?
How much money will I need each month in retirement?
Will I run out of money in my retirement?

If these are questions you have asked yourself, our complimentary Blueprint can most likely help provide clarity.  The Blueprint is our main tool that is drafted early in our relationship and incorporates all of your portfolio pieces to provide you a snapshot of your income needs during retirement.  Your complimentary Blueprint is based on your needs and dreams and, as a client, will be reviewed and updated as your income needs change.
It's all about you, you are in charge of the process.  We provide the education to help you crystallize your goals, needs, dreams...  You drive the timing and level of our involvement of our assistance to you.  Our goal is to provide you clarity so you can make wise decisions in all your financial decisions through life, and especially when you approach retirement.
When the time comes to "hatch" your "Nest Egg", we have over two decades of experience using a comprehensive retirement income distribution model that implements a tiering approach.  In the retirement phase of your life, one of the main concerns is to not outlive your resources.  Our Time Release approach is easy to understand and provides step-by-step guidance for you to use as a foundation for your income needs during retirement.
