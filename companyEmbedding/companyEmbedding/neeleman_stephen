"Once you really understand how an HSA plan works, you will never go back to conventional health insurance." -Jon Kessler


Jon Kessler
President / CEO
Jon Kessler is the president and CEO of HealthEquity, managing the company's day-to-day operations and leading the Board of Directors. He joined HealthEquity in 2009.
Jon is the founder of WageWorks (NYSE: WAGE), a provider of tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter and other employee spending account benefits. During his tenure as chairman and CEO from 2000 through 2007, WageWorks was named to the Inc. 500 list of US private growth companies three consecutive years, growing from zero to nearly $100m in sales. Jon was also previously a senior economist in Washington, DC, specializing in employee benefits and environmental taxation during the Clinton and Bush (Sr.) administrations, and a benefits taxation specialist at Arthur Andersen, LLP.
Jon holds a master's degree in Public Policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in Washington, DC. He holds a US patent for inventions covering methods for electronically adjudicating pre-tax healthcare and other expense transactions. Jon is an advisory board member of the Innovation in Insurance program of the University of South Carolina's Moore School of Business.
"Once you really understand how an HSA plan works, you will never go back to conventional health insurance. I am proud to say that NOBODY supports families making the jump to HSAs like HealthEquity. Whether its reviewing hospital bills for errors, using claims-level analysis to find specific ways to spend less, or creating a plan to build health savings for the long term, our specialists walk you through it, anytime, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week."






"HSAs are key to our mission and they are quickly changing the way the people purchase, consume, and provide health care."-Stephen Neeleman


Stephen D. Neeleman, MD
Founder / Vice Chair
Dr. Stephen Neeleman is the founder and vice chairman of HealthEquity. Steve founded HealthEquity in 2002, with the vision to repair the fractured relationship between patients and their physicians and to help more people obtain quality health insurance by re-introducing consumerism to health care. Steve is the co-author of The Complete HSA Guidebook—How to Make Health Savings Accounts Work for You, in its 5th Edition.
In addition to his duties as founder and vice chairman of HealthEquity, Steve is currently a practicing general and trauma surgeon for Intermountain Healthcare at American Fork Hospital and Utah Valley Regional Medical Center.

Steve was appointed by Utah's Governor, Gary Herbert, to serve as a board member of HIP Utah, Utah's high-risk insurance pool. He also serves on the Council for Affordable Health Insurance HSA Working Group, and on America's Health Insurance Plans' HSA Leadership Council.
Prior to his medical training, Steve worked as the general airport manager for Morris Air (later acquired by Southwest Airlines), based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Steve helped combine efficiency, technology, and excellent customer service to succeed in a rocky industry. This innovative business model allowed Morris Air to rise above financially struggling competitors. Steve's goal is to use this model to help save another struggling industry—health care.
Steve completed his undergraduate degree and played football at Utah State University. He attended medical school at the University of Utah and completed his surgical training at the University of Arizona. Steve also served as an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Arizona.
"HealthEquity's mission is to save health care by helping people better save and spend their health care dollars. HSAs are key to our mission and they are quickly changing the way the people purchase, consume, and provide health care. HealthEquity's remarkable team members help individuals, families, and businesses understand and reap the triple-tax advantaged benefits that come with HSAs. I love being part of this team!"

Fall 2013

E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year
Dr. Stephen Neeleman ‘94, Founder and CEO of HealthEquity, was named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year(R) for 2013 in the health care products and services category for the Utah Region. He will now move on to compete at the national level for the award. The award recognizes outstanding entrepreneurs who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in such areas as innovation, financial performance, and personal commitment to their businesses and communities.
                        

"I took this class, medical sociology, taught by Reed Geertsen, and it reallyopened my eyes to the cost of healthcare and our system of health insurance."

Neeleman credits a USU class he took during his sophomore year for giving him the idea for what became HealthEquity. “I took this class, medical sociology, taught by Reed Geertsen, and it really opened my eyes to the cost of healthcare and our system of health insurance,” he said.
After graduating from Utah State, where he also played football, he went on to the University of Arizona Medical School. He is still a practicing surgeon with the Intermountain Healthcare system, but has devoted his time and energy to creating HealthEquity, a health savings trustee that services more than 800,000 health care accounts for employees at more than 23,000 companies across the United States.
