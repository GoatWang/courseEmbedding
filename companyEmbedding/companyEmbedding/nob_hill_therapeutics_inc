Nob Hill Massage
 
by Deidre Hassan
 

Licensed Massage Therapist




I have been practicing Therapeutic Massage in Albuquerque, New Mexico since 2014.
  I feel I have always been in tune with the human body and have been a conduit for healing my entire life.


I attended the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics in 2013.  
I have become trained in, and certified to practice, multiple modalities including, Swedish Massage, Sports Massage, Non-Specific Stretches, Deep Tissue, Hot Stone, Pregnancy Massage, Geriatric Massage, as well as Shiatsu, Polarity Therapy, Unwinding, Myofascial Release, Reflexology, and Aromatherapy. 


I am dedicated and passionate about impacting my community in a positive way through massage and energy work. I have a genuine desire to help people relieve their pain and to truly relax. My goal, with every massage treatment I give, is to always leave my clients feeling better and more alive than when they arrived.
