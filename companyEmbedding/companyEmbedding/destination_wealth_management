Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look











Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Wealth Management
4 MINUTE READ









Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

For the 8th consecutive year, Barron's1 has named Michael Yoshikami
as one of the top 100 independent investment advisors in the United States!
1Barron’s ranking of the “Top 100 Independent Advisors” is based on assets under management, the quality of the advisors’ practices, and the revenue they generate for their firms.  Investment performance isn’t an explicit criterion, since clients’ investment objectives differ; for some clients, simply keeping abreast of inflation is sufficient. The scoring system assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them to the top-ranked adviser.

Learn More

 
What does it mean you are an independent firm?
We are an independent privately held company. We have no outside investors or parent company. We work for our clients and nobody else.

 
What is the fiduciary standard?
Registered Investment Advisors (like us) have to legally follow a fiduciary standard. It means that we are legally obligated to put our client’s best interests first. This means avoiding conflicts of interests.
 
What kind of assets do you use in your portfolio?
We use a variety of assets including individual stocks/bonds, exchange traded funds, institutional mutual funds, and alternative assets (preferred stocks, REITS, commodities). The assets utilized depend on each client’s strategy and preference.

 
Do you offer discretionary investment management?
Yes. Before we invest, we discuss the investment plan with you so you are fully aware of your investment strategy. Once we start trading, we are proactive and trade on a discretionary basis to execute buy/sell decisions in your portfolio.

BECOMING A CLIENT
What is the process of becoming a client?
We typically have a meeting or two to listen to your needs, ask questions, provide some initial analysis and see if it’s a good fit. We will review your planning needs and current investment portfolio. There is no cost or obligation for these introductory meetings.

Contact us at 800-947-3864. We can start a discussion in person or by phone.
 
How are you compensated?
We are compensated based on a percentage of assets under our direct management. That’s it. No commissions. Fee only so you know we are unbiased in our recommendations.
 
Where would my investment assets be held?
We do not directly hold any investment assets. We utilize custodians such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments. We only have limited authority on accounts to buy/sell investments and bill/debit for our fees.
 
If I become a client, how long do I have to commit?
There is no required length of commitment.  But we strongly recommend long term thinking when embarking on any new investment strategy or relationship.
 
What kind of communication and reports would I receive?
Learn More
 
Can you work with my other professionals?
Yes. In fact, it’s important for us to coordinate with your other professionals. We can provide reports including gain/loss reports for taxes and other documents to any parties you currently work with.
 
Can you suggest or recommend an attorney or accountant?
Yes. We work with a number of qualified professionals covering a broad range of specialties.

Destination Wealth Management is proud to serve its clients and be recognized nationally as a top independent wealth management firm.

Barron's Top 100 Independent Advisors: Michael Yoshikami

Bloomberg Markets Top 50 RIAs
2015, 2014
FT 300 Top Registered Investment Advisors
2016, 2014
 
Barron’s:
Barron’s ranking of the “Top 100 Independent Advisors” is based on assets under management, the quality of the advisors’ practices, and the revenue they generate for their firms.  Investment performance isn’t an explicit criterion, since clients’ investment objectives differ; for some clients, simply keeping abreast of inflation is sufficient. The scoring system assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them to the top-ranked adviser. 

Bloomberg Markets:
Bloomberg Markets ranked active U.S. registered investment advisers that provide financial planning services based on the data they reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission as of June 1, 2015. We used filings as of June 2, 2014, for year-over-year comparisons.
The ranking excludes firms that operate as or are affiliated with broker-dealers, banks, or thrifts; trust or insurance companies; or firms with employees who are registered representatives of broker-dealers. We also excluded firms that take commissions, sell financial products, or operate as real estate agents, lawyers, insurance brokers, or accountants. We did not consider multifamily offices.
Our RIAs obtained more than 75 percent of their assets under management from high-net-worth individuals. Up to 25 percent of their AUM was from any of the following sources: investment and business development companies; pooled investment vehicles; pension and profit-sharing plans; charitable organizations, corporations, or other businesses; state or municipal government entities; other investment advisers; and/or investors that the RIAs described in the filings as “other.”
Financial Advisor:
To be eligible for the Financial Advisor Magazine RIA ranking, firms must be independent registered investment advisors and file their own ADV statement with the SEC. They need to provide financial planning and related services to individual clients.
Firms were measured and ranked by their growth in assets under management from 2015 to 2016 to determine the top 50 fastest growing.
Financial Planning Magazine:
Discovery Data compiled the rankings based on discretionary and nondiscretionary assets under management listed on SEC Form ADV. To capture independent fee-only planning firms, every effort is made to exclude firms with broker-dealer and insurance company affiliations and those with substantial outside ownership stakes held by private equity firms and some outside investors. The list also does not include roll-ups, aggregators or turnkey asset management programs.
To capture firms that provide true holistic financial advice to individuals, only firms with 50% or more individual clients, as can be determined through the Form ADV, are included.
Subjective review of unusual cases may result in inclusion or exclusion based on factors unique to those firms. As the RIA industry evolves, so does the criteria.
Financial Times 300 Disclosure:
The 2014 Financial Times Top 300 Registered Investment Advisors is an independent listing produced by the Financial Times (June, 2014). TheFT 300 is based on data gathered from RIA firms, regulatory disclosures, and the FT’s research. As identified by the FT, the listing reflected each practice’s performance in six primary areas, including assets under management, asset growth, compliance record, years in existence, credentials and accessibility. Neither the RIA firms nor their employees pay a fee to The Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 300.

Portfolio Strategies 

Destination Wealth Management has developed investment strategies to suit differing portfolio objectives. Portfolio strategies and the equity to fixed income ratio is an important consideration when making a judgment regarding the most appropriate investment plan for your situation. Because DWM has developed a wide variety of strategies, it is possible to more closely align individual financial planning objectives with a selected portfolio strategy. This alignment between your investment strategy and your planning goals is an important consideration as flexibility can mean better fit for your individual situation. We invite you to learn more about the wide variety of strategies available to you as an investor as well as discuss how we might design a strategy that meets your needs.

Portfolio Management 

The portfolio management process is an ongoing service designed to adjust investments and strategy based on current economic and market conditions. Too often investors develop strategies and then ignore new developments which could impact return and risk. At Destination Wealth Management, we believe the portfolio management process should not only factor in proactive rebalancing of accounts but also reflect our perspective on markets and the economy. As a discretionary manager, we are deeply engaged with our clients in discussions about their long-term goals and this impacts how we manage assets (particularly legacy positions held previous to DWM). Portfolios cannot be ignored nor can markets and economic conditions be discounted. The portfolio management process is designed to adjust investment strategies based on changing conditions and this proactive effort is a valuable service offered by DWM.

About Michael Yoshikami
Michael Yoshikami, Ph.D., CFP®, is CEO and Founder of Destination Wealth Management and Chairman of DWM's Portfolio Strategy Committee. Founded in 1986, Destination is a San Francisco Bay Area-based independent firm that provides fee-based wealth management services to institutional and individual investors. Michael was named by Barron’s1 as one of the “Top 100 Independent Financial Advisors”, eight years in a row (2009 – 2016).
Michael has over 30 years’ experience in the investment management and financial planning field. As Chairman of the Portfolio Strategy Committee, he oversees the macro tactical asset allocation weightings for client portfolios and develops the economic viewpoints that guide portfolio strategies. Michael is involved in the investment decision making process and works closely with other research professionals at the firm to develop prudent strategies in today’s challenging environment.
Michael has appeared on CNBC TV in the United States, Asia, and Europe as well as CBS radio and FOX Business TV. The focus of the media appearances is to provide investors’ insight on current market and economic conditions as well as his view on portfolio strategy alternatives available to investors appropriate for current conditions.

Michael has provided content for CNBC.com, publishes the weekly investment focused newsletter “Common Sense” and is author of the book “Your Money, Your Future”. He holds a Ph.D. in Education, an MBA, and has earned the Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) designation.
Barron’s ranking of the “Top 100 Independent Advisors” is based on assets under management, the quality of the advisors’ practices, and the revenue they generate for their firms.  Investment performance isn’t an explicit criterion, since clients’ investment objectives differ; for some clients, simply keeping abreast of inflation is sufficient. The scoring system assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them to the top-ranked adviser.

The Place to Be!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CARecommendsProsI am proud to work at YCMNET Advisors! I've been around long enough to know of which I speak.This company has grown from a small to one of the largest Investment Advisory Firms in the nation,it's not by accident... The CEO has always been forward thinking with a Strategic Vision, alwaysstrives to have the best capable team, and most important... always strives to put the Clients bestinterests first. Being part of this, and being able to help so many people along the way is very satisfying.YCMNET has the best management team in company history, and also the best collective groupof talented and "the right fit" employees ever! I've read some of the other postings, you're alwaysgoing to have some hits and misses when hiring, those were some of the misses.Very competitive salary... Excellent health insurance... Generous PTO [Personal Time Off]...Many team building events... Additional perks... Very adaptive and understanding to one'sspecial situations that may arise... Chance for advancement in the company...The CEO and Management are always open to your ideas, and in fact encourage you to do so.They realize there's never one absolute correct way of looking at or doing something. If therewas there would be no reason in having 9 Supreme Court Justices.ConsOpen environment workplace can be distracting at times and cause some inefficiency.Multi-tasking can be taken to the extremes sometimes.Advice to ManagementContinue the course of allowing each individual / department to have more autonomy.Continue always being forward thinking with Strategic Visions!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-08-01 19:32 PDT Apr 24, 2012 Helpful (1)"Horrible place to work!!!! Extremely high turnover."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CADoesn't RecommendDisapproves of CEOProsThe Pay is above market and benefits are good. There are a few great people at the firm that are smart and fun to work with. Most are in a purgatory state due to horrible economic conditions. Company lunches and trip are great. Company owner is a phenomenal spokesman which helps drive asset gathering.ConsI will not drag this out. The turnover rate is astronomical!!! The positive reviews on this site are likely management plants or a tiny select few that will be here for life, either due to absolute apathy or a complete understanding that their pay is not commensurate with skill level. The firm is full of secretive situations, middle school drama and infighting. Distrust in management runs fluidly throughout the firm,including those that are afraid to speak up. It is unimaginable how high the turnover would be in better economic conditions. I would never reccomend anyone working here!Advice to ManagementPlease understand your own strengths and weaknesses. Stick to media promotion and sales. Please leave the management of your business to others. Worry less about combatting negatve reviews and fix the culture from the top down? Understand the difference between perks and culture. Everyone will benefit!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2012-04-24 22:22 PDT Sep 13, 2010 Helpful (5)"I made it off the Island"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CADoesn't RecommendProsEveryone that works there is usually paid well, the firm offers good employee benefits but in the end, it doesn’t outweigh the negatives. There’s a yearly company trip to Las Vegas which is fun but it is also a way to have “mandatory” teambuilding with no overtime. Also lots of food and “perks” to help with the daily suffering that employees endure.ConsFrom what I’ve seen and heard, the owner of the firm is narcissistic, manipulative, and lives in his own delusional world. The management team is the owner’s group of puppets – they have no power. There’s mental and emotional manipulation and job security is used to keep you in line. In my time working there, I have seen lives destroyed. Highest employee turnover rate I’ve ever seen at any company. I completely agree with the other negative reviews on this site. The 5-star ratings are suspect. I don’t feel that the way this company is run reflects of the culture that is talked about over and over and over again at the staff meetings as well as what is written on the wall. Things might have been different if the owner was more concerned with the actual company and not just trying to get famous.There is extreme favoritism – if you’re a young hot female, you will do well (it doesn’t matter if you’re married or single). If you fall out of favor, you will suffer public humiliation and/or be given a severance package.And to the other reviewer, let me answer your question about if you are on Survivor. YES, we were there and I am glad to be off THAT island!Advice to ManagementWAKE UP AND GET A CLUE! Stop being a yes man and do your job. You are given titles and responsibilities but you don’t live up to them. Your employees are real people. There are not hired for your personal amusement.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-09-13 12:37 PDT Aug 27, 2010 Helpful (6)"There is reason for the high turnover. Very unstable workplace."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CADoesn't RecommendProsThe bonuses are high. Howeve,r there is one caveat. You must work there for a designated period of time to reap these rewards and typically the employee is terminated or leaves before that actually happens.ConsDon't let the promise of future monetary incentives(ie...promotion, bonuses, retirement plan match) lure you into this company. Executive management decisions are rather impulsive and driven by emotion.This small firm is a "sole proprietorship" in every sense. Run by one owner that controls and dictates the direction and vision of the Company. Ultimately it is the owner that makes all the decisions. Even if those decisions do not keep the Employee's and the Company's best interest in mind. For such a small company, turnover is extremely high. This is due to the stressful, volatile environment in the workplace and frequent company re-orgs (layoffs). Employee satisfaction rating should be alot lower than 2.3 but since it had to average out all ratings including the two possible biased "5 star" ones. Unfortunately, all the negative ratings are true. It is not recommended to work at YCMNet unless you are unemployed and your EDD benefits ran out. Do not leave a good or even bad job to work here. You will regret it.Advice to ManagementTurnover is bad for business.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-08-27 07:26 PDT Jul 15, 2010 Helpful (1)"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CARecommendsProsProsOne major pro at YCMNET Advisors - Clients’ best interest is a priority at all times.Competitive salary and very generous benefits package. When I tell others about the benefits and the environment, everyone cannot believe how good it is and they always ask me, “Is there an opening?”Offers flexibility to the needs of employees.The office is modern and promotes “at home” atmosphere.Based on my experience with this company, if you get things done and if you are a hard worker, you will advance in your career.Management at YCMNET does not tolerate rude and degrading behavior towards employees. I witnessed termination of relationships with people who have been rude to employees. The CEO is very fair and honest, down to earth and not someone who believes in politics. In fact, I have seen, on a few occasions, where those looking to play games had to leave the company.As far as my experience is concerned, contrary to what has been said by others, management promotes and continue to encourage candor and open communication.I am posting this because this is a great company, I’m very happy to work for YCMNET Advisors and I know current employees are happy too or else they would not be here for years. Anyway, YCMNET is a great company with good, honest people who really cares about the staff. No wonder so many people try to work at the firm.ConsCompany is growing rapidly so sometimes, staff is uncertain about roles and instructions.Very open environment so noise and privacy is an issue.Some employees are uncomfortable about the required independent attitude about workAdvice to ManagementManagement needs to clearly define the roles of each employee.Management needs to work on resolving the privacy issue in the office.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-07-15 11:54 PDT May 6, 2010 Helpful (8)"Am in on Survivor?"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut Creek, CADoesn't RecommendProsI was attracted to YCMNET because of they offer a competitive salary, full benefits, PTO and are located conveniently between Walnut Creek BART and downtown. The office itself is roomy and modern. They used to offer an annual team-building trip to Las Vegas, which can be fun, depending on your current status with the CEO or his "pet" employees.As a fee-only investment advisor, i agree with their business model and they've managed to create a good brand around the "Hawaiian" way of life. That's about as far as the pro's go.ConsThe founder and CEO of YCMNET first majored in Psychology, and once told me that it's fun to "play around with and study people." He manipulated employees, lied about opportunities and fostered an environment of mistrust and fear. He is the boss that will call you at midnight to make a request and expect you will have no problem completing it by 8:00 am.There was no honest communication from leadership about anything. Rather, we turned to whispers and gossip for information. The last thing the leaders of this firm want to do is provide opportunities for mentoring and helping their staff become successful.I often found myself working in emergency "this has to be done yesterday" situations. Most employees are generally stressed out from this constant rushing to get things done. There are some advisors that completely take advantage of the support staff. They often complained of being overworked and unappreciated.If you are incapable of playing the "Survivor" game-- forging alliances, gathering information that has nothing to do with your job or department, playing games and kissing up to the right people-- this is not the place for you. However, if you're a fan of political posturing, triangulation and drama, you will fit right in.Advice to ManagementA little honesty goes a long way. Do right by your employees and they will thank you by committing to your company and doing their best work.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (8) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-05-06 16:26 PDT Apr 7, 2010 Helpful (8)"One owner shop run by well-spoken, ego-maniac.

They offer a competitive benefits package, have a very modernly designed office space, and are close to commuter access of BART and downtown Walnut Creek. YCMNET is attractive upon first introductions as a busy, clean, and a professional workplace offering opportunity, growth and advancement. They also offer an attractive business model for client investing.ConsYCMNET Advisors prides itself on the culture and values it attempts to manifest and has these values of candor, integrity, respect etc. exhibited around the office. However, these values are missing from the interactions of the upper management towards its employees. The treatment of YCM employees is far below these values and creates an uncomfortable working environment. Furthermore, there is a pattern of 'sweeping under the rug' or hiding and disregarding unprofessional interactions and management behaviors; yet, the issues trickle down to create a disgruntled workforce, silently working to keep their job with concerns of whom may be treated this way in the future. Needless to say, job security is always in question.In addition, the management style is one of exceeding micromanagement tactics with lack of communication for the cause or effect. Office setting and interactions are contrived and include secrecy and whispering in it's open office setting. The organizational procedures are merely an attempt to be efficient, but are constantly changing due to lack of trust throughout the company; top to bottom.Primarily, integrity is highly questionable at YCMNET; and, ironically their business is entrusting one's personal investments with them.Advice to ManagementBecome examples of your values by any means necessary. Train the Managers to respect employees, not minimize them with micromanagement. Recreate trust in the environment. Eliminate management cliques and promote respectful, professional relationships. Should matters be private, assure that they are private not secrets trickling down the ladder. Address unprofessional behaviors at all levels immediately.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (9) Destination Wealth Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Destination Wealth Management 2010-04-08 10:02 PDT Apr 6, 2010 Helpful (7)"I recommend not wasting your time nor talent."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Walnut, CADoesn't RecommendProsThe pay is decent and a few of the advisors & staff are good people.ConsThis is a company whose values are based on lies, deceit, and intimidation.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 10/29/2009
            

                BBB has determined that Destination Wealth Management meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
