Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

History[edit]
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. was founded in 1989 by Emmanuel Friedman, Eric Billings, and Russ Ramsey. The firm held its initial public offering in 1997, raising $206 million.[1]
From its founding through 2008, FBR Group was taxed as a real estate investment trust that operated in four business segments consisting of principal investing, capital markets, asset management and mortgage banking. The principal investing segment consisted primarily of investing in residential MBS on a leveraged basis. The capital markets segment consisted of investment banking services and institutional brokerage services. The asset management segment conducted through registered investment advisors provided clients with mutual fund services, alternative asset management and private wealth advisory. The capital markets and asset management segments were conducted through FBR Capital Markets. The mortgage banking segment consisted of the origination and sale of non-conforming, including non-prime residential mortgage loans conducted through its subsidiary First NLC Financial Services, Inc.
Mr. Ramsey left the company in 2001. Following the early 2000s recession, FBR Group invested heavily in subprime mortgages and housing until the subprime mortgage crisis.[2] The company announced severe losses related to its underperforming mortgage origination platform and widespread problems in subprime mortgage lending, which led to a sale of ownership in FBR's subprime subsidiary First NLC Financial Services, Inc in the summer of 2007.
In 2005, the SEC began investigating FBR Group for insider trading done in 2001. The firm was charged with short selling CompuDyne, a maker of security systems. In 2006 FBR paid $7.8 million to the SEC and $4.5 million to CompuDyne to settle the charges, but did not admit any wrongdoing. Mr. Friedman was personally fined $1.2 million, and barred for two years from supervising a brokerage firm. Mr. Friedman left FBR Group in 2005, during the investigation.[3][4][5]
FBR Capital Markets (Nasdaq: FBRC) was formed through an equity spin-off from FBR Group in the spring of 2007.[6]
In 2009, FBR Group changed its name to Arlington Asset Investment Corp. and fully divested its ownership of FBR Capital Markets.[7]
Starting in 2009, Arlington Asset Investment revoked its status as a real estate investment trust and began being taxed as a C corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The decision to elect to be taxed as a C corporation was driven primarily from the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards that allow the company to shield substantially all of its income from income taxes.
In June 2014, Eric Billings stepped down as CEO and J. Rock Tonkel, Jr. was appointed CEO. Mr. Billings remains as Executive Chairman. Mr. Tonkel previously served as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. [2]
Sponsorship[edit]
Arlington Asset Investment sponsored the Phoenix Open PGA golf tournament held in Scottsdale, Arizona from 2004 until 2009.[8]

ARLINGTON, Va., April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE:    AI) (the "Company" or "Arlington") today reported net income of $5.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and non-GAAP core operating income of $14.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP core operating income to GAAP net income (loss) before income taxes appears at the end of this press release.








First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights

$0.22 per diluted share of GAAP net income 
$0.60 per diluted share of non-GAAP core operating income 
$15.83 per share of book value 
$13.08 per share of tangible book value 
$0.625 per share dividend 

"The Company generated positive results for the quarter," said J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Despite volatility in the mortgage sector during the quarter, rates ended about flat and tangible book value was generally unchanged from year-end.  Cash returns continued to be strong with an annualized return on tangible equity from core operating income of 18%.  Earnings for the quarter benefited from lower prepayment speeds due to both normal seasonal factors and the sharp increase in rates following the U.S. Presidential election.  However, the benefit to earnings of lower prepayments speeds was offset by higher cost of funding driven by Federal Reserve rate increases, a larger average interest rate hedge position, and lower investment balances at the beginning of the quarter.  Overall, hedged agency investment returns continue to remain attractive, while dampened somewhat from recent levels by increases in short-term funding costs.  The Company remains committed to generating a resilient stream of consistent spread income to support dividends in a tax advantaged manner to its shareholders."  
Other First Quarter Highlights
As of March 31, 2017, the Company's agency MBS investment portfolio totaled $4,864 million in fair value, consisting of $4,391 million of specified agency mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and $473 million of net long to-be-announced ("TBA") agency MBS.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company's $4,864 million agency MBS investment portfolio was comprised of the following:

$1,889 million of 3.5% coupon 30-year agency MBS 
$2,975 million of 4.0% coupon 30-year agency MBS and TBA agency MBS

As of March 31, 2017, the Company's $4,391 million specified agency MBS portfolio had a weighted average amortized cost basis of $105.48 and a weighted average market price of $104.30.  The Company's fixed-rate agency MBS are comprised of securities backed by specified pools of mortgage loans selected for their lower propensity for prepayment.  Weighted average pay-up premiums on the Company's agency MBS portfolio, which represent the estimated price premium of agency MBS backed by specified pools over a generic TBA agency MBS, were almost one-half a percentage point as of March 31, 2017, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2016.  
As of March 31, 2017, the Company's net long TBA agency MBS investment portfolio had a purchase price of $469 million and market value of $473 million, resulting in a net GAAP carrying fair value of $4 million.  Under GAAP, the gross fair value of the agency MBS underlying the Company's TBA commitments is not recognized on the balance sheet as the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments.  
As of March 31, 2017, the Company had $4,242 million of repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average rate of 1.03% and remaining weighted average maturity of 12 days secured by an aggregate of $4,497 million of agency MBS at fair value.  
Interest income less interest expense on short-term financing on the Company's agency MBS portfolio was $21.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $16.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, including the amortization of the Company's net premium on its agency MBS of $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $9.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Company's weighted average yield on its agency MBS was 2.85% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2.55% for the fourth quarter of 2016, and the actual weighted-average constant prepayment rate ("CPR") for the Company's agency MBS was 8.17% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 12.90% for the fourth quarter of 2016.  
The Company reported TBA dollar roll income of $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.  TBA dollar roll income is considered the economic equivalent of investing in agency MBS financed with a repurchase agreement and is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the "spot" sale of the same security.   Under GAAP, the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments and recognizes income from TBA dollar rolls as a component of net investment gains and losses in the Company's financial statements.  
The Company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of its cost of borrowing and the value of its agency MBS portfolio including interest rate swap agreements and put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures.  
Under the terms of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays semiannual interest payments based on a fixed rate and receives quarterly variable interest payments based upon the prevailing three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") on the date of reset. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had $1,100 million in notional amount of interest rate swap agreements maturing in less than 3 years with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 1.24% and a remaining weighted average maturity of 2.0 years, $125 million in notional amount of interest rate swap agreements maturing between 3 to 7 years with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 2.09% and weighted average maturity of 4.8 years, and $2,000 million in notional amount of interest rate swap agreements maturing between 7 to 10 years with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 2.01% and a remaining weighted average maturity of 9.1 years.  In addition, the Company had $375 million in notional amount of forward starting two-year interest rate swap agreements that become effective in September and October of 2017 with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 1.13%.  
In addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company also had a series of contracts whereby the Company either purchased or sold put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of the value of its fixed-rate agency MBS portfolio.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company purchased contracts that provide the Company with the option to put 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures to a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $700 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 2.63%, and sold contracts that provide a counterparty the option to call 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from the Company with an equivalent notional amount of $350 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 2.35%.  In order to limit its exposure on the sold call options from a significant fall in long-term interest rates, the Company also purchased contracts that provide the Company with the option to call 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $350 million as of March 31, 2017 that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 2.10%.
As of March 31, 2017, the Company's private-label MBS portfolio consisted of $1.3 million at fair value.  Interest income less interest expense on short-term financing on the Company's private-label MBS portfolio was $37 thousand for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. 
During the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net investment losses on its investment portfolio, inclusive of TBA derivative positions, of $0.9 million and net investment losses on its related interest rate derivative hedging instruments of $0.9 million for a net investment loss on its hedged investment portfolio of $1.8 million.  Excluding TBA dollar roll income and interest rate swap net interest expense included in non-GAAP core operating income, the Company had net investment losses on its investment portfolio of $4.3 million and net investment gains on its related interest rate derivative hedging instruments of $4.5 million for a net investment gain on its hedged investment portfolio of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share.
Corporate Tax Structure
The Company is subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company's estimated net operating loss carry-forward was $85.1 million that begins to expire in 2027 and its estimated net capital loss carry-forward was $320.0 million that begins to expire in 2019.  The Company's estimated net operating and net capital loss carry-forwards as of March 31, 2017 are subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company's income tax returns.  For GAAP accounting purposes, as of March 31, 2017 the Company had a deferred tax asset of $65.1 million, or $2.75 per share, which reflects a substantial valuation allowance against its net capital loss carry-forwards.  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of $3.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.
Distributions to Shareholders
The Company's Board of Directors approved a distribution to common shareholders of $0.625 per share for the first quarter of 2017.  The distribution will be paid on April 28, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2017.
The tax characterization of the Company's distributions to shareholders is determined annually and reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year.  As a C-corporation, distributions to shareholders of current or accumulated earnings and profits are qualified dividends eligible for the 23.8% maximum federal income tax rate whereas similar distributions to shareholders by a REIT of current or accumulated earnings and profits are nonqualified dividends subject to the higher 43.4% maximum federal tax rate, inclusive of the 3.8% Medicare tax rate, on ordinary income.  Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits would be reported as returns of capital instead of qualified dividends.  Distributions that are classified as returns of capital are nontaxable to the extent they do not exceed a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock, or as a capital gain to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock. 
Conference Call
The Company will hold a conference call for investors at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 26, 2017 to discuss the Company's first quarter 2017 results. 
Investors may listen to the earnings call via the internet at:  http://www.arlingtonasset.com/index.php?s=19.  Replays of the earnings call will be available for 60 days via webcast at the Internet address provided above, beginning two hours after the call ends.
Additional Information
The Company will make available additional quarterly information for the benefit of its shareholders through a supplemental presentation that will be available at the Company's website, www.arlingtonasset.com.  The presentation will be available on the Webcasts and Presentations section located under the Updates & Events tab of the Company's website.

Non-GAAP Core Operating Income
In addition to the Company's results of operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied in the United States ("GAAP"), the Company also reports "non-GAAP core operating income."  The Company defines core operating income as "economic net interest income" less "core general and administrative expenses."
Economic Net Interest Income
Economic net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the interest income earned net of interest expense incurred from all of our interest bearing financial instruments as well as agency MBS which underlie, and are implicitly financed through, our TBA dollar roll transactions.  Economic net interest income is comprised of the following:

net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP; 
TBA agency MBS dollar roll income, which is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the "spot" sale of the same security, earned ratably over the period beginning on the settlement date of the sale and ending on the settlement date of the forward-settling purchase; and 
net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements.

In the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, TBA agency MBS dollar roll income and the net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements are reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of derivative instruments within the line item "gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net" of the "investment gain (loss), net" section. We believe that economic net interest income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term-focused, net interest spread-based investment strategy, prior to the deduction of core general and administrative expenses.  
Core General and Administrative Expenses
Core general and administrative expenses are non-interest expenses reported within the line item "total general and administrative expenses" of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income less stock-based compensation expense.  For the first and second quarters of 2016, core general and administrative expenses also exclude non-recurring expenses related to the 2016 proxy contest that are in excess of those normally incurred for an annual meeting of shareholders. 
Non-GAAP Core Operating Income Results
The following table presents the Company's computation of core operating income for the last four fiscal quarters (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

Non-GAAP core operating income is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist with the determination of the appropriate level of periodic dividends to stockholders.  The Company believes that non-GAAP core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity.  A limitation of utilizing this non-GAAP financial measure is that the effect of accounting for "non-core" events or transactions in accordance with GAAP does, in fact, reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results.  For example, the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements, such as U.S. Treasury note futures or options on U.S. Treasury note futures, do not affect the computation of non-GAAP core operating income.  In addition, the Company's calculation of non-GAAP core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  Therefore, the Company believes that net income and comprehensive income determined in accordance with GAAP should be considered in conjunction with non-GAAP core operating income.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
