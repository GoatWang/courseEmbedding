RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Low-Quality Bond Risk: The fund concentrates a large portion of its investments in low-quality bonds (sometimes called “junk bonds”), which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale."

Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale." If you are interested in municipal bonds, please take a look at my last article, "MUI: Investment Opportunity For Investors On The Sidelines?"

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Nuveen New York AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NRK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A
