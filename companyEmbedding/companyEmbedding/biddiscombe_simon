ServiceSource Provides Leadership Update and Reaffirms Q3 Guidance

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      ServiceSource®

      (NASDAQ:SREV), the global leader in recurring revenue management, today

      announced executive leadership changes and has reaffirmed the company's

      third quarter business outlook.

    

ServiceSource today announced the following executive appointments and

      transitions:

    


ServiceSource appointed Simon Biddiscombe as interim CFO,

        effective as of September 29, 2014. Mr. Biddiscombe replaced Ashley

        Johnson, who became Acting CEO in August, when Mike Smerklo

        stepped down as CEO after an 11-year tenure. Mr. Biddiscombe joins

        ServiceSource with a 25-year track record in senior leadership roles

        at leading technology companies.

      

Jim Dunham, who previously served as Senior Vice President of

        Product Management, will succeed Richard Campione as the

        President of the Cloud & Business Intelligence unit. Having

        successfully established a strong team and foundation for the Cloud &

        Business Intelligence unit, Mr. Campione will remain a member of the

        executive team as an advisor to the CEO on its technology strategy

        through the end of 2014, at which point he will return to his original

        role as a Board Director.

      

Tom Bonos has resigned from his role as Executive Vice

        President of Outside Sales to pursue other opportunities. The regional

        sales leaders will now report in to Ashley Johnson, Acting CEO. The

        transition will enable Ms. Johnson to drive the customer-centric

        alignment that is central to ServiceSource's strategy going forward.

      



      "As we continue to drive the turnaround of our business, the strategic

      nature of our partnerships with customers underscores the strength of

      our value proposition," said Ashley Johnson, Acting CEO of

      ServiceSource. "In the quarters ahead, as we seek to restore growth and

      profitability to the company, our guiding principle is alignment with

      our customers. As such, we expect our leadership, investments, product

      strategy and service offerings to provide a centralized focus on helping

      companies retain more customers and expand their recurring revenue

      businesses."

      Officer. Before QLogic, Mr. Biddiscombe served as Senior Vice President,

      Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Mindspeed Technologies, Inc., a

      semiconductor company, from June 2003 until April 2008, and as Secretary

      from April 2004 until April 2008.

      Controller of the Internet infrastructure business of Conexant Systems,

      Inc. (Conexant), a designer, developer and seller of semiconductor

      system solutions for communications applications, from December 2000 to

      June 2003. He was the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

      from May 1999 to December 2000 and the Chief Operating Officer from May

      2000 to December 2000 of Wyle Electronics, a distributor of

More than a regular search engine.

never have to search someone on google again.
