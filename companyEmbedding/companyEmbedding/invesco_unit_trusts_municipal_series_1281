MLP & Income Portfolio 2016-3



High Income Allocation Portfolio 2016-3


The attached final Prospectus for a prior series of the fund is hereby used
as a preliminary Prospectus for the above stated series. The narrative
information and structure of the attached final Prospectus will be substantially
the same as that of the final Prospectus for this series. Information with
respect to pricing, the number of units, dates and summary information regarding
the characteristics of securities to be deposited in this series is not now
available and will be different since each series has a unique Portfolio.
Accordingly, the information contained herein with regard to the previous series
should be considered as being included for informational purposes only. Ratings
of the securities in this series are expected to be comparable to those of the
securities deposited in the previous series. However, the Estimated Current
Return for this series will depend on the interest rates and offering prices of
the securities in this series and may vary materially from that of the previous
series.


Information contained herein is subject to completion or amendment. Such
units may not be sold nor may an offer to buy be accepted prior to the time the
registration statement becomes effective. This Prospectus shall not constitute
an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any
sale of the units in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would
be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of
any such state.


(Incorporated herein by reference is the final prospectus from Invesco Unit
Trusts, Series 1664 (Registration No. 333-210198) as filed on May 11, 2016,
which shall be used as preliminary prospectuses for the current series of the
fund.)


The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved these
securities or passed upon the adequacy of this Prospectus. Any representation to
the contrary is a criminal offense.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
