1-on-1 Mentor Training





Sometimes the best way to learn is in a one on one with the instructor with whom you connect best. Explore a topic of your choosing once in an hour long training with your choice of instructor.
For example, a student asked for an outside-the-box learning of the greeks and how to use them effectively with his trading style.  Instructor Jeff came up with a lesson plan that brought the concept home for this student to help him continue on his way to trading success.

Meet Wendy Kirkland
 
How  did an award-winning artist and sculptor who owned an eclectic gift shop in  Historic Biltmore Village, end up an option guru?  Let’s see…
In  2004 a freak flood destroyed the retail business Wendy and her husband had  poured every bit of their time and money into for more than 25 years. 
Since  they had no flood insurance, they lost everything… and were in real trouble.  Fortunately, a friend introduced Wendy to options trading.
Desperate  to save her family from financial ruin, Wendy started reading books, watching  financial news, and taking courses… struggling with the same sort of ups and  downs as most new traders.
Then  one day she stumbled upon a miraculous discovery.  By combining two common indicators into one,  she created a hybrid indicator that’s nearly 100% infallible!
Practically  overnight Wendy was making more money trading than she and Jack had ever made  in their store!
Inspired to help other women enjoy the financial security  she had found, Wendy started giving onIine classes. And in 2009 she  co-authored a book entitled: “Option Trading In Your Spare Time—A Guide to  Financial Independence for Women”.
“I feel I was  given a second chance,” Wendy said. “So I felt I owed it to society to give  back, and help others.  And go make a  difference”
And that’s exactly what she’s done… in spades!
Get this, undeterred by the title and pretty pink cover of her first  book, even more men than women ended up buying it!   And  that led to 6 more books, trading courses, newsletters, and advisory services.
Written about in Money Magazine, Small Business Opportunities Magazine,  and Investor’s Business Daily… Wendy is quoted as saying :  “I LOVE  that my books have helped so many people achieve financial independence through  trading, just like I had.”
Grandma’s  Simple Secret for Extra Income is Wendy’s gift to you... ENJOY!
 
Option and stock investing involves risk and is not suitable  for all investors. Only invest money you can afford to lose in stocks and  options. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The trade entry  and exit prices represent the price of the security at the time the recommendation  was made. The trade record does not represent actual investment results. Trade  examples are simulated and have certain limitations. Simulated results do not  represent actual trading. Since the trades have not been executed, the results  may have under or over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market  factors such as lack of liquidity. No representation is being made that any  account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.

Profits Run - About Us























About Us


At Profits Run, our goal is to teach regular people how to become better, smarter, and safer traders in any market.
Whether it’s stocks, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or foreign exchange (forex), we have training, software, and coaching for everyone at every level of experience.



What we don’t do is promise to help you "get rich quick" – that’s why you won’t see any crazy income claims from us. Instead, our philosophy is more along the lines of protecting your portfolio as much as possible. And that’s why our primary focus with all of our programs is risk management. Once you learn how to properly manage risk, trading can be a lot less stressful.

Profits Run was founded in 2001 by father and son team Bill Poulos and Greg Poulos. It was named after the saying, "cut your losses and let your profits run", which most traders know well.

Madison Covered Call and Equity Strategy Fund (MCN)


Fund Objective

MCN has a primary objective of obtaining a high level of current income and gains, with a secondary objective of achieving long-term capital appreciation.



Investment�Strategies
We believe these goals can be met by investing in large and mid-capitalizations stocks that are, in our opinion, selling at a reasonable price with respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. The income comes in the form option premiums which are generated by writing covered calls on a majority of stocks in the portfolio.

The Case for Covered Calls



 The Case for Covered Calls
Covered call writing is a time-tested approach that can add income, dampen volatility and diversify both equity and fixed income core strategies. Adding a covered call strategy in a core satellite, multi-asset-class approach can be accomplished as:
A hedged equity strategy with an “income kicker” to enhance overall income productionA supplement to a core large-cap strategy (especially late in the market cycle when valuations are long-in-the-tooth and price action is volatile) as a means of boosting income and mitigating downside riskA better-yielding alternative to a high yield bond allocationWe believe that investors are well-served by strongly considering the addition of an income-producing covered call strategy in virtually all market environments and multi-asset class strategies. Madison’s active call writing/active stock selection approach provides more opportunity for premium income and alpha from underlying security selection than common passive call writing.



What is a Covered Call Strategy?
A covered call strategy owns shares of a publicly traded company, while selling (or writing) call options on the same assets. Call options give the buyer of the option the right to purchase the stock at a predetermined “strike price” within a set time frame (typically nine months or less). Selling call options produces income to the portfolio, which can be distributed or reinvested: known as a “buy/write” strategy, the income may act as a source of yield to the investor, or can be reinvested to help offset losses in a market decline.
Several peer-reviewed studies suggest that a covered call strategy performs at least in-line with the S&P 500 Index over longer periods of time, while realizing lower standard deviation of returns.(1)  The return profile is appealing, but investors must be aware that the performance of covered call strategies differs with market environments.
The covered call strategy tends to underperform in steadily- or sharply-rising markets as the income generated by covered call writing is offset by the opportunity cost of having appreciating, underlying assets called away. Income generated by selling covered calls in this environment tends to constitute the bulk of returns (supplemented by limited capital gains on the underlying stocks).


Downside Protection
In sideways and down market environments, covered call writing tends to outperform due to the significant income generated from selling calls, as well as dividend income from the underlying stocks and any alpha generated by the security selections of an active manager. Of course, even with the downside protection provided by the call premium and dividends,  there is a greater likelihood that the options will expire worthless (out of the money) in this environment, leaving the portfolio holding the stock along with the premium income. While a steep market decline, such as that experienced in 2008, can result in a negative total return in a covered portfolio, its performance should exceed that of its underlying assets by roughly the amount of the premiums (minus expenses). We would argue that the current environment of full valuations and market volatility is favorable for covered call writing strategies.
The Income Advantage
A primary attraction of writing covered calls is immediate income; the premium can vary depending on the security involved, the price history of the stock and the market environment. A volatile stock will likely offer higher call premiums, and the overall premiums for calls will rise as overall market volatility rises. This pattern is popularly measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (“VIX”), which tracks the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options. The premium income from writing these calls can provide an alternate method for generating yield. 
A report published in January 2012 gives a sense of the income potential of covered call writing, showing 1.8% historic monthly yield of the BXM between June 30, 1986 and December 31, 2011.(2) Option income is usually taxed as short-term gains, making the strategy best suited for tax-deferred and tax-exempt assets, but, depending on the length of the option, income may also be taxed as long-term gain.
Potential for Positive Return in a Flat Market
A covered call strategy can be a powerful alternative strategy for performance in a flat market. Writing calls with a strike price out-of-the-money (e.g. $55 on a $50 stock) allows room for capital appreciation, while earning the call premium. Out-of-the-money calls have a strike price higher than the current market price of the underlying security. Across a diversified portfolio of stocks on which call options are written, the premium income can boost returns above a stock-only portfolio in a year in which the traditional stock indices are up nominally. In the past, there have been long periods of flat returns in the equity market: these are the periods in which a covered call allocation can be a significant driver of value-added returns. The least conducive environment for a covered call strategy is a steeply advancing market, since much of the gain on underlying securities will be truncated by the securities getting called away at strike prices lower than the advancing market price. 
An Analytical Review of a Covered Call Strategy
A study by Goldman Sachs in January 2012(2) reviewed 16 years of covered call trades (1996-2011) and concluded, “overwriting added to returns and lowered the risk of diversified portfolios.” The extent of the advantage was quantified as 3.6% annually, with a reduction of standard deviation of monthly returns by 20%. These results were predicated on selling 10% out-of-the-money, one-month covered calls on S&P 500 stocks with liquid options. In addition, the study found better results from writing calls on large-cap over small-cap companies, while there was no significant difference between value and growth stocks. The results were also based on writing covered calls on a large number of stocks, with a specific (10%) out-of-the-money prescription, using one-month options. While this methodology differs from Madison’s covered call writing strategy, it lends credence to our belief that a carefully managed covered call strategy has the potential to produce attractive returns, reduce risk and provide meaningful additional income.
Madison’s Covered Call Management
Active Stock Selection – Madison starts with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) approach to build the underlying covered call equity portfolio. The process seeks to select high-quality companies, which have solid balance sheets, excellent profitability, strong management and elicit confidence in continued profitability. We seek to purchase such companies when their valuations are reasonable, and when we see the available option premiums for the stock as attractive. We focus on larger companies (market caps of $3 billion or more) that have a history of excellent return on capital, strong long-term growth rates and positive cash generation. Historically, the majority of our investments have been focused on the Financial, Technology, Consumer, Health Care, Energy and Industrial sectors. 
Our active stock selection process, which includes rigorous fundamental analysis of all portfolio candidates, results in a high-conviction portfolio of 40-70 stocks. We seek to avoid over-priced and speculative issues through our valuation discipline. We expect the stock component of our portfolio to show lower volatility and better downside protection than the market in general. 
Active Call Writing – We purchase individual stock options, rather than index options, because we believe individual stock options can offer higher premiums. Typically we write out-of-the-money calls which allow for the potential for upside participation if the underlying stock price advances. When selecting options, we look at the outlook for the underlying stock, the outlook for the overall market, the implied volatility history of the stock and the absolute and annualized total return potential for each stock/option combination. We often have multiple calls written for the same stock in the portfolio, giving us a range of strike prices and option expiration dates.
Why Madison Covered Call? 
Madison has been a leader in covered call management since 2004: the Madison Covered Call and Strategic Equity Fund (MCN) was the first closed-end covered call strategy fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm also manages the Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund (MSP), another closed-end fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Madison Covered Call and Equity Income Fund, a proprietary, open-end mutual fund. Madison’s strategy of active stock and option management differentiates its portfolios from the more common passive strategies, and provides an opportunity to manage risk while exploiting the higher premiums available for individual stocks. The lead portfolio manager, Ray DiBernardo, CFA, has been working on the strategy since its inception in 2004, and the team together brings nearly 60 years of investment experience to their covered call clients.

The writer of a covered call option forgoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline.An investment in the fund or strategy is subject to risk and there can be no assurance the fund or strategy will achieve its investment objective. The risks associated with an investment in the fund or strategy can increase during times of significant market volatility. The principal risks of investing in the fund or strategy include: equity risk, mid-cap company risk, option risk, tax risk, concentration risk and foreign security and emerging market risk. With regard to the fund, more detailed information about these risks can be found in the fund’s prospectus.

Before investing in the funds, considered the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus contains this and other information about the fund and should be read carefully before investing.
CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500® stock index option prices. Since its introduction in 1993, VIX has been considered by many to be the world’s premier barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility.
CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM) is the passive representation of a covered call strategy. The BXM Index is an unmanaged (passive) total return index based on buying the S&P 500® stock index portfolio and “writing” (or selling) the near term S&P 500® Index “covered” call option (SPX) every month with an exercise price just above the prevailing index level (i.e., slightly out of the money). The SPX call is held until expiration and cash settled, at which time a new one-month, near-the-money call is written.S&P 500® Index (SPX) is a group of 500 widely held stocks and is commonly regarded to be representative of the large capitalization stock universe. 
The VIX, BXM and SPX are unmanaged indices which do not allow for direct investment. Indices are used in this piece for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the performance of any particular Madison portfolio, fund or composite. 
Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in a security’s or index’s value.

1-on-1 Mentor Training





Sometimes the best way to learn is in a one on one with the instructor with whom you connect best. Explore a topic of your choosing once in an hour long training with your choice of instructor.
For example, a student asked for an outside-the-box learning of the greeks and how to use them effectively with his trading style.  Instructor Jeff came up with a lesson plan that brought the concept home for this student to help him continue on his way to trading success.

Meet Wendy Kirkland
 
How  did an award-winning artist and sculptor who owned an eclectic gift shop in  Historic Biltmore Village, end up an option guru?  Let’s see…
In  2004 a freak flood destroyed the retail business Wendy and her husband had  poured every bit of their time and money into for more than 25 years. 
Since  they had no flood insurance, they lost everything… and were in real trouble.  Fortunately, a friend introduced Wendy to options trading.
Desperate  to save her family from financial ruin, Wendy started reading books, watching  financial news, and taking courses… struggling with the same sort of ups and  downs as most new traders.
Then  one day she stumbled upon a miraculous discovery.  By combining two common indicators into one,  she created a hybrid indicator that’s nearly 100% infallible!
Practically  overnight Wendy was making more money trading than she and Jack had ever made  in their store!
Inspired to help other women enjoy the financial security  she had found, Wendy started giving onIine classes. And in 2009 she  co-authored a book entitled: “Option Trading In Your Spare Time—A Guide to  Financial Independence for Women”.
“I feel I was  given a second chance,” Wendy said. “So I felt I owed it to society to give  back, and help others.  And go make a  difference”
And that’s exactly what she’s done… in spades!
Get this, undeterred by the title and pretty pink cover of her first  book, even more men than women ended up buying it!   And  that led to 6 more books, trading courses, newsletters, and advisory services.
Written about in Money Magazine, Small Business Opportunities Magazine,  and Investor’s Business Daily… Wendy is quoted as saying :  “I LOVE  that my books have helped so many people achieve financial independence through  trading, just like I had.”
Grandma’s  Simple Secret for Extra Income is Wendy’s gift to you... ENJOY!
 
Option and stock investing involves risk and is not suitable  for all investors. Only invest money you can afford to lose in stocks and  options. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The trade entry  and exit prices represent the price of the security at the time the recommendation  was made. The trade record does not represent actual investment results. Trade  examples are simulated and have certain limitations. Simulated results do not  represent actual trading. Since the trades have not been executed, the results  may have under or over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market  factors such as lack of liquidity. No representation is being made that any  account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.

Profits Run - About Us























About Us


At Profits Run, our goal is to teach regular people how to become better, smarter, and safer traders in any market.
Whether it’s stocks, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or foreign exchange (forex), we have training, software, and coaching for everyone at every level of experience.



What we don’t do is promise to help you "get rich quick" – that’s why you won’t see any crazy income claims from us. Instead, our philosophy is more along the lines of protecting your portfolio as much as possible. And that’s why our primary focus with all of our programs is risk management. Once you learn how to properly manage risk, trading can be a lot less stressful.

Profits Run was founded in 2001 by father and son team Bill Poulos and Greg Poulos. It was named after the saying, "cut your losses and let your profits run", which most traders know well.
