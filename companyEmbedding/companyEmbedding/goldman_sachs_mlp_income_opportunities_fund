      In addition, portfolio holdings as of June 30, 2017, as well as

      GSAM Closed-End Fund landing page at www.GSAMFUNDS.com/cef.
    

The Funds


      Each Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company 
      managed by GSAM’s Energy & Infrastructure Team, which is among the 
      industry’s largest MLP investment groups. The Goldman Sachs MLP Income 
      Opportunities Fund began trading on the NYSE on November 25, 2013, and 
      the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund began trading on the 
      NYSE on September 26, 2014.
    

      Each Fund seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current 
      distributions to shareholders. The Goldman Sachs MLP Income 
      Opportunities Fund invests primarily in MLP investments. The Goldman 
      Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund invests primarily in MLPs and 
      other energy investments. Each Fund currently expects to concentrate its 
      investments in the energy sector, with an emphasis on midstream MLP 
      investments. The Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund invests 
      across the energy value chain, including upstream, midstream and 
      downstream investments.
    

About Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.


      GSAM is the asset management arm of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
      (NYSE:GS), and supervises $1.21 trillion as of June 30, 2017.1 
      GSAM has been providing discretionary investment advisory services since 
      1988 and has investment professionals in all major financial centers 
      around the world. The company offers investment strategies across a 
      broad range of asset classes to institutional and individual clients 
      globally. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment 
      banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide 
      range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base 
      that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and 
      high-net-worth individuals.
    

1 Assets Under Supervision (AUS) includes assets under 
      management and other client assets for which Goldman Sachs does not have 
      full discretion.
    

Disclosures


      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (“NAV”), which may increase investors’ risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor’s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that a Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related 
      to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.
    

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Each Fund has completed 
      its initial public offering. Investors should consider their investment 
      goals, time horizons and risk tolerance before investing in a Fund. An 
      investment in a Fund is not appropriate for all investors, and the Funds 
      are not intended to be a complete investment program. Investors should 
      carefully review and consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, 
      charges and expenses before investing.
    

For additional information, please visit the Funds’ website at www.GSAMFUNDS.com/cef.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap N/A     Shares Outstanding 44.13 M     Public Float N/A     Yield 8.55% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.21 (05/26/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 05/17/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.84      Net Money Flow ()  144,205    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.               Advertisement         Competitors GMZ   Data not available.

RESOLVED, that the proposed form and amount of each fidelity bond discussed at this meeting (each, a Fidelity Bond) be, and
the same hereby is, approved with respect to the Goldman Sachs MLP Income Opportunities Fund and Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund (each, a Fund), after consideration of all factors deemed relevant by the Board, including,
but not limited to, the expected value of the assets of each Fund to which any officer or employee may have access, the type and terms of the arrangements made for the custody and safekeeping of assets of each Fund, and the nature of the securities
and other assets in each Funds portfolio; and be it further  RESOLVED, that the filing of an application to renew each
Fidelity Bond be, and it hereby is, authorized and approved in all respects; and be it further  RESOLVED, that the officers of each
Fund be, and each of them hereby is, authorized and directed to renew each Fidelity Bond; and be it further  RESOLVED, that the

further  RESOLVED, that pursuant to Rule 17d-1(d)(7) under the 1940 Act, the Board, including a majority of the Independent

and be it further  RESOLVED, that each Funds Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, hereby finds that the

respects; and be it further  RESOLVED, that each Funds officers be, and each of them hereby is, authorized to renew the

POLICYHOLDER

DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF

TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

(for policies with no terrorism exclusion or sublimit)

Insuring Company: FEDERAL INSURANCE

COMPANY

You are hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the “Act”), this

policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising out of certain acts of terrorism.

Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United

States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human

life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States,

or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a

United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part

of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy

or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

 

You should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by acts of

terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under the formula set forth in the

Act. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses that

exceed the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance company

providing the coverage. Beginning in 2016, the Federal share will be reduced by 1% per

year until it reaches 80%, where it will remain.

 

However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act

exceed $100 billion in a calendar year, the Treasury shall not make any payment for

any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.   10-02-1281 (Ed. 03/2015)   
  




If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed

$100 billion in a calendar year and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act,

we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that

exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to

pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the

Treasury.

 

The portion of your policy’s annual premium that is
attributable to insurance for such acts

of terrorism is: $ -0-.

 

If you have any questions about this notice, please contact your agent or broker.   10-02-1281 (Ed. 03/2015)
