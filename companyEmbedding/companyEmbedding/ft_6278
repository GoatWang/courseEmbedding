            Property Description
    


Built for entertaining, this three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home in the gated community of East Lake, is impressive from the moment one steps through the double wood doors to the beautiful courtyard.  Functional design, large pocketing sliders and abundant windows create a feeling of space and light throughout. The kitchen, family room, living room, master bedroom and guest suite all provide access to the spacious courtyard pool area that features both covered and uncovered seating areas, privacy wall, vaulted screen and a large solar heated swimming pool. The kitchen, open to the adjacent family room, features white cabinetry, dark granite countertops, bar seating, breakfast area with bay window and pantry. For entertaining, the dining room and living room are just on the opposite side of the kitchen and provide access to a separate screened lanai which opens to the completely fenced backyard. The master suite boasts dual walk-in closets, dual vanities, soaking tub, water closet and large shower with views of the tranquil private garden. There are two guest bedrooms, one with a separate entrance that features a kitchenette and a full bath to allow for a completely private multi generational living space. A large three-car garage completes this residence. East Lake is a charming gated community conveniently located close to outstanding schools, I-75 access points, shopping, dining and all the recreational activities that Sarasota has to offer.

            Thank you for your recent inquiry with The Home Depot. Unfortunately, we do not stock this item in an 8' x 10' size. The largest we carry is 5' x 8'.

It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!
