The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	This Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-K that address activities, events or developments which we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), oil, gas, gas liquids and power prices, demand for our services, the amount and nature of future investments by governments, expansion and other development trends of the oil and gas and power industries, business strategy, expansion and growth of our business and operations, the outcome of legal proceedings and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results could differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:




	 













	•






	curtailment of capital expenditures due to low prevailing commodity prices or other factors, and the unavailability of project funding in the oil and gas and power industries;
















	•






	the demand for energy moderating or diminishing;
















	•






	inability to comply with the financial and other covenants in or to obtain waivers under our credit facilities;
















	•






	failure to obtain the timely award of one or more projects;
















	•






	reduced creditworthiness of our customer base and higher risk of non-payment of receivables;
















	•






	project cost overruns, unforeseen schedule delays and the application of liquidated damages;
















	•






	inability to execute fixed-price and cost-reimbursable projects within the target cost, thus eroding contract margin and, potentially, contract income on any such project;
















	•






	inability to satisfy New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements for our common stock;
















	•






	increased capacity and decreased demand for our services in the more competitive industry segments that we serve;
















	•






	inability to lower our cost structure to remain competitive in the market or to achieve anticipated operating margins;
















	•






	inability of the energy service sector to reduce costs when necessary to a level where our customers’ project economics support a reasonable level of development work;
















	•






	reduction of services to existing and prospective clients when they bring historically out-sourced services back in-house to preserve intellectual capital and minimize layoffs;
















	•






	the consequences we may encounter if, in the future, we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting;
















	•






	the impact of any litigation, including class actions associated with our restatement of first and second quarter 2014 financial results on our financial position and results of operations, including our defense costs and the costs and other effects of settlements or judgments;
















	•






	adverse weather conditions not anticipated in bids and estimates;
















	•






	the occurrence during the course of our operations of accidents and injuries to our personnel, as well as to third parties, that negatively affect our safety record, which is a factor used by many clients to pre-qualify and otherwise award work to contractors in our industry;
















	•






	cancellation or delay of projects, in whole or in part, for any reason;
















	•






	failing to realize cost recoveries on claims or change orders from projects completed or in progress within a reasonable period after completion of the relevant project;
















	•






	political or social circumstances impeding the progress of our work and increasing the cost of performance;
















	•






	inability to predict the timing of an increase in energy sector capital spending, which results in staffing below the level required to service such an increase;











	3









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements


















	•






	inability to hire and retain sufficient skilled labor to execute our current work, our work in backlog and future work we have not yet been awarded;
















	•






	inability to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms;
















	•






	inability to obtain sufficient surety bonds or letters of credit;
















	•






	loss of the services of key management personnel;
















	•






	the consequences we may encounter if we violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or other anti-corruption laws in view of the 2008 final settlements with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in which we admitted prior FCPA violations, including the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, enhanced monitoring arrangements, or other sanctions that might be imposed;
















	•






	the dishonesty of employees and/or other representatives or their refusal to abide by applicable laws and our established policies and rules;
















	•






	inability to obtain and maintain legal registration status in one or more foreign countries in which we are seeking to do business;
















	•






	downturns in general economic, market or business conditions in our target markets;
















	•






	changes in and interpretation of U.S. and foreign tax laws that impact our worldwide provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate;
















	•






	changes in applicable laws or regulations, or changed interpretations thereof, including climate change regulation;
















	•






	changes in the scope of our expected insurance coverage;
















	•






	inability to manage insurable risk at an affordable cost;
















	•






	enforceable claims for which we are not fully insured;
















	•






	incurrence of insurable claims in excess of our insurance coverage;
















	•






	the occurrence of the risk factors listed elsewhere in this Form 10-K or described in our periodic filings with the SEC; and
















	•






	other factors, most of which are beyond our control.







	Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the consequences for, or effects on, our business or operations that we anticipate today. We assume no obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.



















	 






	 






	 














	Unless the context requires or is otherwise noted, all references in this Form 10-K to “Willbros,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Willbros Group, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and their predecessors.

	PART I










	Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties




	General




	Willbros is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction, maintenance and facilities development services. We believe our long experience and expertise in the planning and execution of projects differentiates us from our competitors, provides us with competitive advantages in the markets we serve and positions us for early involvement in projects. Our maintenance capabilities provide us the opportunity to participate in the full life cycle of projects, many of which have design lives of more than 25 years.




	Willbros provides its services through operating subsidiaries. The Willbros corporate structure is designed to comply with jurisdictional and registration requirements and to minimize worldwide taxes. Subsidiaries may be formed in specific work locations where such subsidiaries are necessary or useful to comply with local laws or tax objectives.




	Company Information




	We maintain our headquarters at 4400 Post Oak Parkway, Suite 1000, Houston, TX 77027; our telephone number is 713-403-8000. Our public website is

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WG.”

Such disclosures will be included on our website in the “Investor Relations” sections. Accordingly, investors should monitor such portions of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and webcasts.




	In addition, we use social media to communicate with our investors and the public about our Company, our businesses and our results of operations. The information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to review the information we post on the following social media channels:













	•






	The Company's Twitter account (twitter.com/willbros);
















	•






	The Company's LinkedIn account (linkedin.com/company/willbros); and
















	•






	The Company's Facebook account (facebook.com/WillbrosGroup).







	Our Vision




	We continue to believe that long-term fundamentals support demand for our services and substantiate our vision for Willbros to be a billion dollar energy infrastructure construction and maintenance company with a diversified revenue stream, stable and predictable operating results and future growth opportunities.




	To accomplish this, we are actively working towards achieving the following objectives:













	•






	Strengthening our focus on project execution;
















	•






	Managing our resources to mitigate the seasonality of our business model;
















	•






	Positioning Willbros as a service provider and employer of choice;
















	•






	Developing long-term client partnerships and alliances by focusing team-driven sales efforts on key clients and exceeding performance expectations at competitive prices; and
















	•






	Meeting or exceeding industry best practices, particularly for safety and performance.











	5









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	We believe that successfully meeting these objectives will generate financial performance exceeding that of our peers and result in full and fair valuation of our common shares.




	Our Values




	We believe the values we adhere to as an organization shape our relationships and the performance of our company. We are committed to strong Leadership across the organization to achieve Excellence, Accountability and Compliance in everything we do, recognizing that Compliance is the foundation for successfully applying all of our values. Our core values are:













	•






	Safety – always perform safely for the protection of our people, our customers and our stakeholders;
















	•






	Honesty & Integrity – always do the right thing;
















	•






	Our People – respect and care for their well-being and development; maintain an atmosphere of trust, empowerment and teamwork; ensure the best people are in the right position;
















	•






	Our Customers – understand their needs and develop responsive solutions; promote mutually beneficial relationships and deliver a good job on time;
















	•






	Superior Financial Performance – deliver earnings per share and cash flow and maintain a balance sheet which places us at the forefront of our peer group;
















	•






	Vision & Innovation – understand the drivers of our business environment; promote constant curiosity, imagination and creativity about our business and opportunities; seek continuous improvement; and
















	•






	Effective Communications – present a clear, consistent and accurate message to our people, our customers and the public.







	We believe that adhering to and living by these values will result in a high-performance organization that can differentiate itself and compete effectively, providing incremental value to our customers, our employees and all our stakeholders.




	Business Segments




	Willbros has three reportable segments:


	Oil & Gas


	,


	Utility T&D


	 and


	Canada


	. These segments are comprised of strategic businesses that are defined by the industries or geographic regions they serve. Each segment is managed as an operation with well-established strategic directions and performance requirements. Each segment is led by a separate segment President who reports directly to the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”).




	The CODM evaluates segment performance using operating income which is defined as contract revenue less contract costs and segment overhead, such as amortization related to intangible assets and general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to the segment. In 2016, we implemented a change to our organizational structure such that corporate overhead costs, such as executive management, public company, accounting, tax and professional services, human resources and treasury, are no longer allocated to each segment. Previously reported segment information has been revised to conform to this new presentation.




	One of our customers in the


	Utility T&D


	 segment, Oncor, was responsible for


	25.0


	 percent,


	17.9


	 percent and


	10.3


	 percent of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations for


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively. Another one of our customers in the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., was responsible for


	9.4


	 percent,


	12.5


	 percent and


	9.1


	 percent of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	See


	Note 13 – Segment Information


	 in


	Item 8


	 of this Form 10-K for more information on our reportable segments and our contract revenue by geographic region.




	On November 30, 2015, we sold the balance of our


	Professional Services


	 segment to TRC Companies (“TRC”). As a result, the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures of the


	Professional Services


	 segment, including the previously sold subsidiaries in 2015 of Willbros Engineers, LLC and Willbros Heater Services, LLC (collectively “Downstream Professional Services”), Premier Utility Services, LLC (“Premier”) and UtilX Corporation (“UtilX”), are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.




	See


	Note 17 – Discontinued Operations

	Oil & Gas




	We provide construction, maintenance and lifecycle extension services to the midstream markets. Our history of executing large and complex pipeline projects has positioned us to participate in pipeline infrastructure markets. To support the extensive oil and gas development activity in the United States, we construct pipelines that connect oil and gas resources to end-markets. We currently provide these services primarily in the United States; however, our experience includes prior work on international projects. We believe that these service offerings, combined with our industry experience in large oil and gas infrastructure projects, allow us to meet our customers’ needs for safety, quality and schedule certainty at a competitive price.




	Pipeline Construction




	We apply our core skills in construction and maintenance of oil and gas infrastructure to provide multiple services needed to support the transportation and storage of hydrocarbons including gathering, lateral and main-line pipeline systems.




	Expansion of unconventional production in the United States has shifted the demand for pipeline construction geographically. The need for take-away capacity for oil, natural gas and liquids from these new production areas is expected to provide project opportunities for construction of oil, liquids and natural gas pipelines.




	Facilities Construction

	Fabrication




	Located on 23 acres of land accessible to the high-load corridor in Edmonton, our state of the art fabrication facility is a multi-faceted and innovative fabrication operation specializing in three main categories: 1) Chromium Carbide Overlay, a process of applying overlay to extend the service life of piping products used in heavy-wear erosion, corrosion and abrasive applications utilized in oil sands extraction and tailings functions; 2) Pipe spool and other general Carbon Steel fabrication (e.g. expansion barrels, block valves, traps and other piping-related components including double jointing and handling); and 3) Fabrication of modules of various sizes and designs, typically pipe rack, equipment, process and pump house modules.




	Our Strategy




	We work diligently to apply our values every day. We use them to guide us in the development and execution of our strategy, which we believe will increase stockholder value by leveraging the full resources and core competencies of an integrated Willbros business platform.




	Key elements of our strategy are as follows:




	Stabilize the Revenue Stream with Recurring Services




	We believe increasing the level of revenue generated by recurring services will make our business model more predictable and allow us to reduce our dependence on large capital projects which are more cyclical in nature.




	Focus on Managing Risk




	We have implemented a core set of business conduct practices and policies to improve our risk profile including diversifying our service offerings and end markets to reduce market-specific exposure and focusing on contract-execution risk starting with our opportunity review process and ending at job completion. We continue to evaluate and improve our risk management techniques.




	Maintain Financial Flexibility




	Maintaining the financial flexibility to meet the material, equipment and personnel needs to support our project commitments, as well as the ability to pursue our expansion and diversification objectives, is critical to our performance and growth.




	Insurance and Bonding




	Certain operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and insured against through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program. We maintain worldwide master commercial insurance policies written through highly-rated insurers in types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the project management and construction industry. These policies cover our property, plant, equipment and cargo against normally-insurable risks. Other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations. Primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with industry standards for the level of our operations and asset base. Risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients. On other projects, “builders all risk insurance” is purchased when deemed necessary. All insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level except for certain basic insurance that must be purchased locally to comply with insurance laws.




	The insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective in all circumstances or against all hazards. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the future, our ability to maintain insurance, which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable, may be affected by events over which we have no control.




	We have been limited in our pursuit of certain larger projects due, in part, to our current balance sheet and bonding capacity. In addition to our other efforts to improve our financial position, we are exploring opportunities to partner with other contractors, which will enable us to work on these larger-scale projects.

	Competition




	We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete against companies that have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. In certain markets, we compete with national and regional firms against which we may not be competitive in price. We have different competitors in different markets, including those listed below.

	•






	Canada


	 Segment – Ledcor, MasTec, Quanta Services, Chicago Bridge & Iron, Matrix Service, Strike, AECOM, JV Driver and Site Energy Services.







	Contract Provisions and Subcontracting




	Most of our revenue is derived from contracts that fall into the following basic categories:













	•






	firm fixed-price or lump sum fixed-price contracts, providing for a single price for the total amount of work;
















	•






	cost plus fixed fee contracts where income is earned solely from the fee received;
















	•






	unit-price contracts, which specify a price for each unit of work performed;
















	•






	time and materials contracts where personnel and equipment are provided under an agreed-upon schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable;
















	•






	a combination of the above (including lump sum payment for certain items and unit rates for others); and
















	•






	MSAs under which we receive work orders for specific projects and which involve one or more of the foregoing categories.







	Changes in scope-of-work are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties. Change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process. These change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue and liquidity either positively or negatively.




	We usually obtain contracts through either competitive bidding or negotiations with long-standing clients. We are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists. Bidders are pre-qualified on the basis of their prior performance for such clients, as well as their experience, reputation for quality, safety record, financial strength and bonding capacity.




	In evaluating bid opportunities, we consider such factors as the clients and their geographic location, the difficulty of the work, current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, the project’s cost and profitability estimates and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders. The bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system, enabling management to monitor projects effectively.




	Virtually all of our contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client. In addition, some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control.




	We act as the prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In our capacity as the prime contractor (or when acting as a subcontractor), we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract specialized activities as hazardous waste removal, horizontal directional drills, non-destructive inspection, catering and security. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as the prime contractor, we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.




	Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur, our margins will decrease, possibly resulting in a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we








	11









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year. In some cases, we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This increased risk is a result of the nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract. Our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred. Revenue from change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price. Profit on change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is reasonably assured. Also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (unapproved change orders). These amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term. If we do not successfully resolve these matters, a net expense (recorded as a reduction in revenues), may be required, in addition to amounts that have been previously provided.




	Contractual Arrangements




	We provide services under MSAs and on a project-by-project basis. MSAs are typically one to three years in duration but can be longer. Under our MSAs, our customers generally agree to use us to provide certain services in a specified geographic region on stipulated terms and conditions, including pricing and escalation. However, most of our contracts, including MSAs and our alliance agreement with Oncor, may be terminated by our customers on short notice. Further, although our customers assign work to us under our MSAs, our customers often have no obligation to assign work to us and are not required to use us exclusively, in some cases subject to our right of first refusal. In addition, many of our contracts, including our MSAs, are opened to public bid and generally attract multiple bidders. Work performed under MSAs is typically billed on a unit-price or time-and-materials basis. In addition, any work encountered in the course of a unit-price project that does not have a defined unit is generally completed on a time-and-materials basis.




	Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, pricing is typically based on a unit-price or fixed-price structure. Under our unit-price contracts, we agree to perform identified units of work for an agreed price. A “unit” can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation. The resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the contract for a fixed fee based on our estimate of the aggregate costs of completing the particular project. We are sometimes unable to fully recover cost overruns on our fixed-price contracts. Industry trends could increase the proportion of our contracts being performed on a unit-price or fixed-price basis, increasing our profitability risk.




	Our storm restoration work, which involves high labor and equipment utilization, is typically performed on a time-and-materials basis and is generally more profitable when performed off-system rather than for customers with which we have MSAs. Our ability to allocate resources to storm restoration work depends on our capacity at that time and permission from existing customers to release some portion of our workforce from their projects.




	We attempt to manage contract risk by implementing a standard contracting philosophy to minimize liabilities assumed in the agreements with our clients. However, there may be contracts or MSAs in place that do not meet our current contracting standards. While we have made efforts to improve our contractual terms with our clients, this process takes time to implement. We have attempted to mitigate the risk by requesting amendments to our contracts and by maintaining primary and excess insurance, with certain specified limits to mitigate our exposure, in the event of a loss.




	Oncor Alliance Agreement




	On June 12, 2008, InfrastruX Group, LLC (“InfrastruX”), a company we acquired in July 2010, entered into a non-exclusive agreement with Oncor. Due to the extensive scope and long duration of the agreement, we refer to it as an alliance agreement. We summarize below the principal terms of the agreement. This summary is not a complete description of all the terms of the agreement.








	12









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	Term, Renewals and Extensions


	. The agreement became effective on August 1, 2008 and will continue until expiration on December 31, 2018, unless extended, renewed or terminated in accordance with its terms. We are currently in discussions with Oncor and anticipate extending or renewing the agreement beyond December 31, 2018. However, we can provide no assurance that the agreement will be extended or renewed.




	Provision of Services, Spending Levels and Pricing


	. Under the agreement, it is anticipated that we will provide Oncor transmission construction and maintenance services (“TCM”), and distribution construction and maintenance services (“DCM”), pursuant to fixed-price, unit-price and time-and-materials structures. The fees we charge Oncor under unit-price and time-and-materials structures are set forth in the agreement, most of which are adjusted annually according to indices provided in the agreement. The agreement also includes a provision whereby Oncor receives pricing at least as favorable as we charge other customers for any “similar services” (which is not a defined term in the agreement). Management believes, based on our pricing practices and the nature and scope of the services we provide to Oncor, that we are in compliance with this provision.




	We frequently hold meetings with Oncor to discuss its forecasted monthly and annual TCM and DCM spending levels. The agreement provides for agreed incentives and adjustments for us and for Oncor according to Oncor’s projected spending levels. Calculations based on projected spending levels are subject to subsequent adjustments based on actual spending levels. The agreement also requires that we provide dedicated resources to Oncor and that we meet or exceed minimum service levels as measured by specified performance indicators.




	Termination


	. Oncor could in some cases seek to terminate for cause or limit our activity or seek to assess penalties against us under the agreement. Oncor may terminate the agreement upon 90-days' notice or any work request thereunder without prior notice in each case at its sole discretion and may terminate the agreement upon 30-days' notice in the event there is an announcement of the intent to undertake or an actual occurrence of a change in control of Oncor or Willbros Utility T&D Holdings, LLC. Oncor may also terminate the agreement for cause if, among other things, we breach and fail to adequately cure a representation or warranty under the agreement, we materially or repeatedly default in the performance of our material obligations under the agreement or we become insolvent.




	In the event Oncor terminates the agreement for convenience or due to an anticipated or actual change of control of Oncor, Oncor must pay us a termination fee. In addition, we would have to adjust a significant portion of our existing customer relationship intangible asset attributed to Oncor which was recorded in connection with the InfrastruX acquisition.




	Employees




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, we directly employed a multi-national work force of

	Global Warming and Climate Change




	Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States (as well as other parts of the world) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.




	We do not know and cannot predict whether any proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments. Depending on the final provisions of such rules or legislation, it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or capital spending requirements or creating additional operating restrictions on us or our customers. It is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels and increase the demand for renewable energy sources, which could adversely affect the demand for some of our services and improve the demand for some of our other services. Likewise, we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change (or otherwise) will have a material impact on our operations.




	Compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not, to date, had a material effect on the cost of our operations, earnings or competitive position. However, as noted above, compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

	Item 1A. Risk Factors




	The nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.




	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS




	Our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure.




	Our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major construction projects. The availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas and electric power industries, and specifically, the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure. Our failure to obtain major projects, the delay in awards of major projects, the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under-utilization of our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow. Numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies, including:













	•






	current and projected oil and gas and electric power prices;
















	•






	the demand for gasoline and electricity;
















	•






	the abilities of oil and gas and electric power companies to generate, access and deploy capital;
















	•






	exploration, production and transportation costs;
















	•






	the discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves;
















	•






	the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;
















	•






	regulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers;
















	•






	local and international political and economic conditions; and
















	•






	technological advances.







	We face a risk of non-compliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities.




	We are subject to a number of financial and other covenants under our credit facilities, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio. On March 31, 2015, March 1, 2016, July 26, 2016 and March 3, 2017 we amended our 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a first amendment, third amendment, fourth amendment and fifth amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”). These amendments, among other things, suspend the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from December 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 (the “Covenant Suspension Periods”) so that any failure by us to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants during the Covenant Suspension Periods will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default. Prior to obtaining the Fifth Amendment, we did not expect to be in compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017.




	We can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in the periods following the completion of the Covenant Suspension Periods or that we would be successful in obtaining additional waivers or amendments to these covenants should they become necessary. Under the Fifth Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio will be 5.50 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will decrease to 4.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio will be 1.60 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will increase to 2.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 2.75 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. If our results of operations do not improve in 2017, we will be unable to meet the required financial covenants.




	In order to ensure future compliance with our financial covenants, we may elect to prepay our credit agreement indebtedness by accessing capital markets or with cash on hand. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in accessing capital markets on terms we consider favorable or reducing costs in amounts sufficient to comply with our financial covenants. Moreover, future prepayments or refinancing of the balance of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement will, in most cases, require us to pay a prepayment premium equal to the “make-whole” amount. The make-whole amount is calculated as the present value of all interest payments that would have been made on the amount prepaid from the date of the prepayment to December 15, 2019 (or June 15, 2019 if the prepayment is made on or after June 15, 2018) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of


	9.75 percent


	 plus the greater of


	1.25 percent


	 and the Eurodollar rate in effect on the date of the repayment.

	Index to Financial Statements









	Even if we successfully comply with our financial covenants, we may suffer adverse consequences if our unused availability under our 2013 ABL Credit Facility drops below certain levels. If our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the greater of (i) 15 percent of the revolving commitments or $15.0 million for five consecutive days, or (ii) 12.5 percent of the revolving commitments or $12.5 million at any time, we are subject to increased reporting requirements, the administrative agent will have exclusive control over any deposit account, we will not have any right of access to, or withdrawal from, any deposit account, or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account, and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility. In addition, if our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the amounts described in the preceding sentence, we would be required to comply with a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.




	Our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility was


	$40.3 million


	 at December 31, 2016. We do not expect our availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility to drop to levels which would require us to comply with the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant over the next 12 months. However, if the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were to become applicable, we would not expect to be in compliance with this covenant.




	A default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit, require us to immediately repay any outstanding cash advances with interest and require us to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations. A default under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable thereunder. If the maturity of our credit agreement indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness. In such an event, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, to the extent permitted by the credit agreements and applicable law.




	Our industry is highly competitive, which could impede our growth.




	We operate in a highly competitive environment. A substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals. We compete for these projects against companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In some markets, there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price. Our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies. Our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, greater resources or other advantages and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept.




	We have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, our business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed.




	We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, most recently for the first three quarters of 2011 and the first two quarters of 2014. We also identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, 2011, and 2010 and for the years 2004 through 2007. We believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated.




	Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements.




	A pending securities class action against us has resulted in significant costs and expenses, has diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




	As further described in


	Note 14


	 of our


	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, after we announced that we would be restating our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014, a securities class action complaint was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of our shareholders and alleging damages on their behalf arising from the matters that led to the restatements. In addition to us, two of our former Chief Executive Officers and our current Chief Financial Officer are named as defendants. We have incurred and/or expect to incur significant professional fees and other costs in defending against the








	16









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	allegations made by the plaintiffs in the class action suit. If we do not prevail in the pending litigation, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage. In addition, our Board of Directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the pending litigation, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




	Our use of fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.




	A significant portion of our revenues is currently generated by fixed-price contracts. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur, our margins will decrease, and we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This risk is a result of the long-term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts, whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.




	In addition, our


	 Utility T&D


	 segment also generates substantial revenue under unit-price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price, which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixed-price contracts. A “unit” can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation. The resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit. Failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses.




	Percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in adjustments that would materially affect our operating results.




	We recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method on long-term fixed-price contracts. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management’s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.




	Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.




	We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations, terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them, in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits. Therefore, project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits.




	Managing backlog in our


	Utility T&D


	 segment also has other challenges. Backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends, seasonal demand and projected customer needs, but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations, and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice. For projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are canceled, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog.

	Legislative or regulatory actions relating to electricity transmission and renewable energy may impact the demand for our services.






	Current and potential legislative or regulatory actions may impact demand for our services. Certain legislation or regulations require utilities to meet reliability standards and encourage installation of new electric transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. However, it is unclear whether these initiatives will create sufficient incentives for projects or result in increased demand for our services.




	While many states have mandates in place that require specified percentages of electricity to be generated from renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states. Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as a backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and may not be viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available. These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which could negatively impact our business.




	Seasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results, profitability, cash flow and working capital needs related to our operating




	segments.




	A significant portion of our business in each of our operating segments is performed outdoors. Consequently, our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. Our operating segments perform less work in the winter months, and work is hindered during other inclement weather events. In particular, our


	Utility T&D


	 segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete. During periods of peak electric power demand in the summer, utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power T&D equipment from service, decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods. The seasonality of this segment’s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate. Because this segment’s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months, we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment’s working capital during the spring and summer. Conversely, our


	Canada


	 segment typically posts its strongest results during the winter and summer months and weaker results during what is known as the “Spring breakup,” when road bans and load limits are put in place and workers are often furloughed and equipment idled. Severe winter weather can also create demand for restoration of storm damage to overhead utility lines, which can offer opportunities for high margin emergency restoration work for our


	Utility T&D


	 segment.




	Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us.




	We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional costs, both direct and indirect. These claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.




	Our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients.




	We operate primarily in the oil and gas and power industries, providing services to a limited number of clients. Much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients. The loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations. One client was responsible for approximately


	25.0


	 percent of total contract revenue from continuing operations in 2016. This client was also responsible for


	42.6 percent


	 of our 12-month backlog and


	45.8 percent


	 of our total backlog at


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, our ability to raise capital or secure insurance or our future growth.




	The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations. In addition, future acts of terrorism could be








	18









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	directed against companies operating both outside and inside the United States. Further, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.




	Our operations are subject to a number of operational risks.




	Our business operations include pipeline construction, fabrication, pipeline rehabilitation services and a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution. We may encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete a project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. These difficulties may be the result of delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customer's failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, delays caused by difficult worksite environments and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric transmission lines, pipelines or other facilities, especially those which are located in environmentally or culturally sensitive areas and more heavily populated areas. We may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.




	Our operations also involve a number of operational hazards. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment and suspension of operations. In locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others, our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and significant liability to third parties.




	The insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable.




	Unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.




	Workplace safety is important to us, our employees and our customers. As a result, we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization. While we focus on protecting people and property, our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities, and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level.




	Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




	We may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors.




	Some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties. In addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work, where work is performed through a joint venture, we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself. In these projects, even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget, we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications.

	We act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal, nondestructive inspection and catering and security. However, with respect to other contracts, including those in our


	Utility T&D


	 segment, we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.




	We are self-insured against many potential liabilities.




	Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, general liability, workers’ compensation and employee group health claims, many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for the overwhelming majority of claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities. The determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.




	Our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities.




	Our U.S. and Canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent. We regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Part of the business in our


	Utility T&D


	 segment is performed in the southwestern U.S. where there is a greater risk of fines, work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing Native American artifacts and archeological sites. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed.




	We own and operate several properties in the United States and Canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released. Any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Compensation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and/or analogous state, provincial or local laws. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment, while RCRA governs the generation, storage, transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes. Under these or similar laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property. The expenses related to this work could have a significant impact on our future results.




	Our operations outside of the U.S. and Canada are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment.




	We are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments.




	Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and/or issued in the United States (as well as other parts of the world) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations, including those introduced or adopted in the future, would impact our business and operations, it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater








	20









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	compliance costs, capital spending requirements or operating restrictions for us and/or our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services. We are also unable to predict how the outcome of the 2016 federal and state elections may affect any existing or proposed regulations or legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.




	We may not be able to compete for, or work on, certain projects if we are not able to obtain any necessary bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances.




	Our contracts may require that we provide to our customers security for the performance of their projects in the form of bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties' assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding or letters of credit, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders and finding more business that does not require bonds or allows for other form of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances.




	Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.




	We are dependent upon the services of our executive management.




	Our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management. Our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships. Our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients, stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals.




	In the past few years, we have experienced significant turnover at the senior management level. We believe that we currently have in place competitive compensation programs with strong retention incentives for our senior management. However, the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations.




	Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.




	Our ability to maintain our productivity and improve profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our strategy.




	We contribute to multi-employer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans.




	We contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer’s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. In addition, if the funding of any of these multi-employer plans becomes in “critical status” under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.




	A number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered” or “critical” status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.

	Our settlements with the DOJ and the SEC may negatively impact us in the event of a future FCPA violation. Our failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business.




	In May 2008, after reaching agreement with the Company, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed an Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) concluding its investigation into violations of the FCPA by Willbros Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. Also in May 2008, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to resolve its previously disclosed investigations of possible violations of the FCPA and possible violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nigeria. We made the final payments under these settlements in October 2011. The criminal information associated with the DPA was dismissed, with prejudice, on April 2, 2012. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.




	Under the SEC settlement, we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws.




	Our failure to abide by the FCPA and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations. A criminal conviction for violations of the FCPA could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief, and would have a material adverse effect on our business.




	Special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business.




	Our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Since the anti-bribery restrictions of the FCPA make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage, we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.




	RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK




	Our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are likely to continue in the future, and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid by you.




	The market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including the following:













	•






	the risk factors described in this Item 1A;
















	•






	a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;
















	•






	changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industries generally;
















	•






	general conditions in our customers’ industries; and
















	•






	general conditions in the securities markets.

	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover, which may adversely affect the performance of our stock.




	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:













	•






	provide for a classified board of directors, which allows only one-third of our directors to be elected each year;
















	•






	deny stockholders the ability to take action by written consent;
















	•






	establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders;
















	•






	provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or President; and
















	•






	authorize our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and to approve the issuance of new series of preferred stock.







	Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.




	Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.




	In the event we issue stock as consideration for acquisitions or to fund our corporate activities, we may dilute share ownership.




	We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we do issue additional equity securities, such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our Company.




	Our future sale of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible securities may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock.




	Our authorized shares of common stock consist of


	105 million


	 shares. The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, one million shares of preferred stock, which may give other stockholders dividend, conversion, voting and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. While our Board of Directors has no present intention of authorizing the issuance of any such preferred stock, it reserves the right to do so in the future.

	Backlog broadly consists of anticipated contract revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured, subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts. MSA backlog is estimated for the remaining terms of the contract. MSA backlog is determined based on historical trends inherent in the MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based on ongoing communications with the customer.





















	(2)






	Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for items which management does not consider representative of our ongoing operations and certain non-cash items of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a supplemental performance measure for comparing normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry and for presentations made to analysts, investment banks and other members of the financial community who use this information in order to make investment decisions about us.







	Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a financial measurement recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies.

	OVERVIEW




	Willbros is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction, maintenance and facilities development services. Our principal markets for continuing operations are the United States and Canada. We obtain our work through competitive bidding and negotiations with prospective clients. Contract values range from several thousand dollars to several hundred million dollars, and contract durations range from a few weeks to more than two years.




	Willbros has three reportable segments:


	Oil & Gas


	,


	Utility T&D


	 and


	Canada


	. These segments are comprised of strategic businesses that are defined by the industries or geographic regions they serve. Each segment is managed as an operation with well-established strategic directions and performance requirements. Each segment is led by a separate segment President who reports directly to the CODM.




	Our


	Oil & Gas


	 segment provides construction, maintenance and lifecycle extension services to the midstream markets. These services include pipeline construction to support the transportation and storage of hydrocarbons, including gathering, lateral and main-line pipeline systems, as well as, facilities construction such as pump stations, flow stations, gas compressor stations and metering stations. In addition, the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment provides integrity construction, pipeline systems maintenance and tank services to a number of different customers.




	At December 31, 2016, the assets and liabilities associated with tank services have been classified as held for sale. See


	Note 4 - Assets Held for Sale


	 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.




	Our


	Utility T&D


	 segment provides a wide range of services in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution, including comprehensive engineering, procurement, maintenance and construction, repair and restoration of utility infrastructure.




	Our


	Canada


	 segment provides construction, maintenance and fabrication services, including integrity and supporting civil work, pipeline construction, general mechanical and facility construction, API storage tanks, general and modular fabrication, along with electrical and instrumentation projects serving the Canadian energy and water industries.




	The CODM evaluates segment performance using operating income which is defined as contract revenue less contract costs and segment overhead, such as amortization related to intangible assets and general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to the segment. In 2016, we implemented a change to our organizational structure such that corporate overhead costs, such as executive management, public company, accounting, tax and professional services, human resources and treasury, are no longer allocated to each segment. Previously reported segment information has been revised to conform to this new presentation.




	General economic and market conditions, coupled with the highly competitive nature of our industry, continue to result in pricing pressure on the services we provide in our


	Oil & Gas


	 and


	Canada


	 segments.

	Looking Forward




	We took difficult, but necessary, steps in 2016 to reduce our overall cost structure from both a segment and corporate perspective. Our efforts to better align our costs with lower revenue has led to an improvement in our continuing operating results when compared to 2015. We believe we have positioned the Company to address the challenges and opportunities in 2017.




	We anticipate our


	Utility T&D


	 segment will continue to execute its growth strategy. We believe opportunities exist to expand our transmission capabilities to service new customers, and this initiative remains a top priority. Our distribution services are positioned to further enhance its capabilities after successfully expanding its footprint in 2016 in both the Southeast and Eastern regions of the United States.




	Our


	Oil & Gas


	 segment has modified its focus to address relatively smaller opportunities, both in terms of size and duration, including mid-diameter pipeline systems, integrity and facilities work. This segment is less dependent on large diameter pipeline construction, but continues to bid and has retained the capability to perform this work. In addition, we anticipate growth in the Northeast as we continue to operate in the active Marcellus and Utica fields.




	In our


	Canada


	 segment, competition among contractors for ongoing maintenance work and small capital projects continues to put pressure on operating margins. We anticipate large capital projects will stay below historical levels for 2017, and we therefore remain focused on serving our client's maintenance needs through MSA agreement renewals and sustaining their small capital projects, coupled with tank construction, pipeline integrity work, mid and small diameter pipeline opportunities and water industry construction services.




	Other Financial Measures




	Backlog




	Backlog broadly consists of anticipated contract revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured, subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts. Additionally, due to the short duration of many jobs, revenue associated with jobs won and performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports. We generate revenue from numerous sources, including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes, including change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work. These revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured.




	Our backlog presentation reflects not only the 12 month lump-sum and MSA work but also the full-term value of work under contract, including MSA work, as we believe that this information is helpful in providing additional long-term visibility. We determine the amount of backlog for work under ongoing MSA maintenance and construction contracts based on historical trends inherent in the MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based on ongoing communications with the customer.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, total backlog was approximately


	$792.5 million


	, and 12 month backlog was approximately


	$419.9 million


	. In comparison to


	December 31, 2015


	, total backlog


	decreased


	 approximately


	$34.3 million


	, and 12 month backlog


	decreased


	 approximately


	$12.3 million


	. The decrease in total and 12 month backlog is primarily attributed to the work-off of revenue, which is out-pacing our additions in the


	Oil & Gas


	 and


	Canada


	 segments.




	Approximately


	$15.2 million


	 of total and 12 month backlog is attributed to our tank services business, which is classified as held for sale at December 31, 2016. Our tank services business is included in our


	 Oil & Gas


	 segment.

	Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations




	We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for items which management does not consider representative of our ongoing operations and certain non-cash items of the Company. These adjustments are itemized in the following table. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.




	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a supplemental performance measure for:













	•






	Comparing normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and
















	•






	Presentations made to analysts, investment banks and other members of the financial community who use this information in order to make investment decisions about us.







	Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a financial measurement recognized under U.S. GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies.

	2016


	 versus


	2015






	Consolidated Results




	Contract Revenue




	Contract revenue decreased


	$177.3 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to a lower volume of work in our


	Oil & Gas


	 and


	Canada


	 segments driven by challenging market conditions for the majority of the year. The overall decrease is also partly attributed to the 2015 exit from both our regional delivery model and service offerings in the downstream market in our


	Oil & Gas


	 segment. The decrease is partially offset by increased revenue in our


	Utility T&D


	 segment driven mainly by our electric transmission construction services in Texas and distribution MSA work along the Atlantic seaboard, Texas and the Gulf Coast.




	Contract Costs




	Contract costs decreased


	$182.9 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to the lower revenue levels previously discussed. Contract margin was


	6.3


	 percent in


	2016


	 compared to


	4.5


	 percent in


	2015


	. The improved margin is primarily related to a reduction of equipment-related indirect costs due to the rationalization of our equipment fleet.

	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	Amortization of Intangibles




	We recorded


	$9.8 million


	 of intangible amortization expense in


	2016


	 primarily related to the amortization of customer relationship and trademark intangibles associated with our


	Utility T&D


	segment. The decrease from 2015 of


	$0.1 million


	 is primarily related to the lack of intangible amortization associated with field, fabrication and union construction turnaround services in our


	Oil & Gas


	 segment, which were fully impaired in 2015.




	General and Administrative




	General and administrative expense decreased


	$16.3 million


	 in


	2016


	 as a result of cost reduction initiatives taken over the last year, including, but not limited to, employee headcount reductions, primarily in our corporate headquarters, as well as the closing of our regional delivery offices and our exit from the downstream market in the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment.




	Gain on Sale of Subsidiary




	The


	$12.8 million


	 reduction in gain on sale of subsidiary is attributed to the 2015 sale of Bemis, LLC (“Bemis”) that did not recur in


	2016


	.




	Other Charges




	We recorded other charges of


	$6.2 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to


	$3.6 million


	 in equipment and facility lease abandonment charges,


	$1.3 million


	 in employee severance charges and


	$1.0 million


	 in losses on disposal of equipment. The year-over-year decrease of


	$12.3 million


	 is primarily related to a


	$5.7 million


	 reduction in losses on disposal of equipment, a


	$4.1 million


	 reduction in equipment and facility lease abandonment charges, a


	$0.4 million


	 reduction in employee severance charges and other termination costs, as well as a


	$0.6 million


	 decrease in legal and accounting costs associated with our investigation related to the deterioration of certain construction projects within our


	Oil & Ga


	s segment and restatement of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 31, 2014.




	Operating Loss




	Operating loss decreased


	$21.4 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily driven by the rationalization of our equipment fleet in our


	Oil & Gas


	 segment and decreased general and administrative costs and other charges year-over-year. In addition, the reduced loss is partly attributable to an increased volume of work in a number of service offerings in our


	Utility T&D


	 segment. The overall decrease in operating loss was partially offset by


	$7.0 million


	 in losses on a cross-country pipeline project in our


	 Canada s


	egment, which was mainly due to adverse weather conditions. The overall decrease in operating loss was also partially offset by a lower volume of work in our


	Oil & Gas


	 and


	Canada


	 segments year-over-year, as well as a $12.8 million gain on the sale of Bemis in 2015, that did not recur in 2016.




	Non-Operating Expenses




	Non-operating expenses decreased


	$52.8 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to


	$33.5 million


	 in debt covenant suspension and extinguishment charges related to the fair value of outstanding stock issued during 2015, which did not recur in


	2016


	. The remaining decrease was related to a reduction of interest expense as a result of a lower Term Loan balance in 2016, compared to 2015, as well as a reduction in prepayment premiums and debt issuance cost write-offs in connection with early payments of debt from asset dispositions, which significantly decreased year-over-year.




	Benefit for Income Taxes




	Benefit for income taxes decreased


	$53.5 million


	 in


	2016


	. The decrease is primarily attributed to a 2015 benefit for income taxes in continuing operations that was partially offset by a 2015 provision for income taxes in discontinued operations in relation to the net gain on sale of subsidiaries in 2015 that did not recur in


	2016


	.




	Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes




	Income from discontinued operations decreased


	$100.0 million


	 to a


	$4.0 million


	 loss from discontinued operations in


	2016


	. The decrease is primarily attributed to a change in net gain on sale of subsidiaries of


	$154.7 million


	 between periods. In 2015, we recorded a large net gain on sale of


	$152.2 million


	 primarily related to the sale of our


	Professional Services


	 segment, as well as the sale of our Premier and UtilX subsidiaries, whereas in


	2016


	, we recorded a loss on sale of


	$2.5 million


	 related to the settlement of working capital and other post-closing adjustments in connection with the sale of our


	 Professional Services


	 segment. The overall decrease from 2015 is also partly attributed to a reduction of income in


	2016


	 from services previously








	34









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	associated with our


	Professional Services


	 segment. The overall decrease is partially offset by a 2015 provision for income taxes of


	$57.2 million


	 related to previously sold subsidiaries that did not recur in


	2016


	.




	Segment Results




	Oil & Gas Segment




	Contract revenue decreased


	$126.7 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to the 2015 exit of both our regional delivery model and service offerings in the downstream market, coupled with a lower volume of work in tank services, facilities and integrity construction services compared to 2015, as well as the 2015 completion of a large project in the Northeast that did not recur in 2016. The overall decrease is partially offset by increased revenue in our mainline pipeline construction service offerings year-over-year.




	Operating loss decreased


	$21.2 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily associated with lower equipment-related indirect costs due to the rationalization of our equipment fleet, as well as a decrease in other charges related to the abandonment of certain equipment and facility leases, mostly in our mainline pipeline construction services. The decreased operating loss is also partly attributed to a reduction of losses associated with our regional delivery model and service offerings in our downstream market, which we exited in 2015, as well as the favorable settlement of a contract dispute with a customer during


	2016


	. The overall decrease is partially offset by a reduction of income in our facilities and integrity construction services due mainly to a lower volume of work compared to 2015.




	Utility T&D Segment




	Contract revenue increased


	$38.8 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily due to an increase in the volume of work in our electric transmission construction services, which includes work performed under our alliance agreement with Oncor, as well as growth in distribution MSA work along the Atlantic seaboard, Texas, and the Gulf Coast. The increase was partially offset by the absence of matting services associated with Bemis, which was sold in 2015.




	Operating income increased


	$11.6 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily driven by the increased volume of work described above, which led to higher margins. The increase is also partly attributed to a decrease in insurance and other employee related costs coupled with the absence of other charges associated with the abandonment of certain equipment and facility leases across the segment compared to 2015. The increase is partially offset by a reduction of income generated from matting services in Bemis, which was sold in 2015.




	Canada Segment




	Contract revenue decreased


	$89.4 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to a lower volume of work across the entire segment due to low prevailing oil and gas prices and pricing pressures from our customers for the majority of 2016. The decrease in contract revenue is also partly driven by the 2015 completion of certain large capital projects that have not recurred in


	2016


	 due to the challenging market conditions described above, which has significantly reduced capital spending by our customers.




	Operating income decreased


	$10.9 million


	 to a loss of


	$0.7 million


	 in


	2016


	 primarily related to


	$7.0 million


	 in losses on one cross-country pipeline project in 2016, which was mainly due to adverse weather conditions. We are exploring options to pursue recovery on claims associated with this project. The overall decrease in income is also driven by a lower volume of work across the entire segment as previously discussed, as well as a change in the mix of services offered during the year. The overall decrease was partially offset by the impact of measures taken to reduce overall operating costs in


	2016


	.




	Corporate




	Corporate costs represent overhead costs, such as executive management, public company, accounting, tax and professional services, human resources and treasury, that are not directly related to the operations of the segments. The decreased costs in 2016 are primarily attributed to continued cost reduction initiatives implemented during the year, including employee headcount reductions, across our corporate headquarters.








	2015


	 versus


	2014






	Consolidated Results




	Contract Revenue




	Contract revenue decreased


	$685.4 million


	 in


	2015


	 primarily related a reduction in the overall volume of work driven by the negative impact of market conditions in the United States and Canada, and the complete reshaping of our


	Oil & Gas










	35









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	segment through the exit of our regional delivery model. The decrease is partially offset by growth in distribution MSA work in the Atlantic seaboard within our


	Utility T&D


	 segment.




	Contract Costs




	Contract costs decreased


	$629.4 million


	 in


	2015


	 primarily related to the lower revenue levels previously discussed. Contract margin was


	4.5 percent


	 in 2015 compared to


	6.1 percent


	 in 2014. The lower margin year-over-year is also related to lower revenue levels, coupled with the inability to reduce indirect operating costs including the under-utilization of equipment.




	Amortization of Intangibles




	We recorded


	$9.9 million


	 of intangible amortization expense in 2015 which is relatively comparable to 2014. The expense relates primarily to the amortization of customer relationship and trademark intangibles associated with our


	Utility T&D


	 segment.




	General and Administrative Expense




	General and administrative expense decreased


	$31.3 million


	 in 2015 as a result of cost reduction initiatives taken over the last year, including, but not limited to, employee headcount reductions across all segments and the closing of our regional delivery offices, which incurred significant overhead costs in prior years.




	Gain on Sale of Subsidiary




	We recorded a


	$12.8 million


	 gain on sale of subsidiary in 2015 as a result of the sale of Bemis in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	Other Charges




	We recorded other charges of


	$18.5 million


	 in 2015 primarily related to


	$7.7 million


	 in equipment and facility lease abandonment charges,


	$6.7 million


	 in losses on disposal of equipment and


	$2.9 million


	 in employee severance and other termination costs. The year-over-year increase of


	$11.8 million


	 is primarily related to increases in equipment and facility lease abandonment and losses on disposal of equipment partially offset by a decrease in legal and accounting costs associated with our investigation related to the deterioration of certain construction projects within our


	Oil & Gas


	segment and restatement of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014.




	Operating Loss




	Operating loss increased


	$23.7 million


	 in 2015 primarily driven by a reduction of income mainly through a lower volume of work, the close-out of certain major projects, declining oil prices and market conditions, a decrease in productivity of available resources and the under-utilization of equipment. In addition, we recorded an increase in other charges of


	$11.8 million


	, as previously discussed, which increased our operating loss year-over-year. The increase in operating loss was partially offset by a


	$12.8 million


	 gain on the sale of Bemis in 2015.




	Non-Operating Expenses




	Non-operating expenses increased


	$20.6 million


	 in 2015 primarily due to


	$39.2 million


	 in debt covenant suspension and extinguishment charges related to the fair value of outstanding stock issued during the first quarter of 2015, prepayment premiums in connection with early payments against our 2014 Term Loan Facility and the write-off of debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of interest expense as a result of a lower Term Loan balance throughout 2015 in comparison to 2014.




	Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes




	Provision for income taxes decreased


	$54.3 million


	 to a benefit of


	$54.0 million


	 in 2015. The change is primarily attributed to increased U.S. operating losses and a decrease in our valuation allowance year-over year coupled with a decrease in profitability in our


	Canada


	 segment.

	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes




	Income from discontinued operations increased


	$101.3 million


	 primarily due to approximately


	$152.2 million


	 in net gains on the sale of the balance of our


	Professional Services


	 segment, as well as our UtilX and Premier subsidiaries. The increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes related to these subsidiaries.




	Segment Results




	Oil & Gas Segment




	Contract revenue decreased


	$529.0 million


	 in 2015 primarily related to lower volumes of work in our mainline pipeline construction services as well as a reduction of revenue resulting from the complete exit from the regional delivery model.




	Operating loss increased


	$7.4 million


	 primarily related to lower volumes in our mainline pipeline construction services that resulted in a decrease in productivity of available resources, the under-utilization of equipment and other costs associated with the abandonment of certain equipment and facility leases and long-lived asset impairment charges. The increased operating loss was partially offset by a reduction of losses from two large pipeline construction projects in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 as well the 2015 exit from the regional delivery model which recorded significant operating losses in 2014.




	Utility T&D Segment




	Contract revenue increased


	$15.9 million


	 in 2015 driven primarily by growth in distribution MSA work in the Atlantic seaboard. The increase in distribution work was partially offset by a decrease in transmission construction work year-over-year for a key customer.




	Operating income decreased


	$12.9 million


	 in 2015 also driven primarily by decreased productivity and utilization in our transmission construction services and distribution MSA work in Texas and the Atlantic seaboard, and other costs associated with the abandonment of certain equipment and facility leases and long-lived asset impairment charges.




	Canada Segment




	Contract revenue decreased


	$172.1 million


	 in 2015 primarily attributed to a lower volume of work across the entire segment due to declining oil prices and challenging market conditions, as well as the close-out of major projects within our construction and maintenance and specialty project services.




	Operating income decreased


	$33.7 million


	 in 2015 primarily due to the completion of certain 2014 major projects that yielded higher margins in the construction and maintenance and specialty project service markets. The reduction in contract margin was partially offset by cost-cutting initiatives throughout the segment.




	Corporate




	Corporate costs represent overhead costs, such as executive management, public company, accounting, tax and professional services, human resources and treasury, that are not directly related to the operations of the segments. The decreased costs in 2015 are primarily attributed to cost reduction initiatives implemented during the year, including employee headcount reductions across our corporate headquarters.

	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES




	Additional Sources and Uses of Capital




	2014 Term Loan Facility




	On December 15, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2014 Term Credit Agreement”) among Willbros Group, Inc., certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. Cortland Capital Market Services LLC currently serves as administrative agent under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement.




	The 2014 Term Credit Agreement provides for a


	five


	-year


	$270.0 million


	 term loan facility (the “2014 Term Loan Facility”), which we drew in full on the effective date of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement. Willbros Group, Inc.is the borrower under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement, with all of its obligations guaranteed by its material U.S. subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries. Obligations under the 2014 Term Loan Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in, among other things, the borrower’s and the guarantors’ equipment, subsidiary capital stock and intellectual property (the “2014 Term Loan Priority Collateral”) and a second priority security interest in, among other things, the borrower’s and the guarantors’ inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and similar assets.




	The term loans bear interest at the “Adjusted Base Rate” plus an applicable margin of


	8.75 percent


	, or the “Eurodollar Rate” plus an applicable margin of


	9.75 percent


	. The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was


	11 percent


	, comprised of an applicable margin of


	9.75 percent


	 for Eurodollar rate loans plus a LIBOR floor of


	1.25 percent


	.




	We made early payments of


	$3.1 million


	 and


	$78.3 million


	 against the 2014 Term Loan Facility during the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively. As a result of these early payments, we recorded debt extinguishment charges of


	$0.1 million


	 and


	$1.9 million


	, respectively, which consisted of prepayment fees of


	2 percent


	 and the write-off of debt issuance costs.




	We are also required to pay a repayment fee on the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility equal to


	5.0 percent


	 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the maturity date. The repayment fee was contingent upon the sale of our


	Professional Services


	 segment, which was completed on November 30, 2015. As a result, we are amortizing the repayment fee as a discount, from that date through the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, using the effective interest method. The unamortized amount of the repayment fee is


	$3.6 million


	 and


	$4.6 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	Since December 31, 2014, we have significantly reduced the balance under the 2014 Term Loan Facility. Under the provisions of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement, with respect to prepayments made from inception of the Term Loan through


	December 31, 2016


	, we have not been required to pay prepayment premiums in respect of the “make-whole amount.” However, future prepayments or refinancing of the balance of the 2014 Term Loan Facility will, in most cases, require us to pay a prepayment premium equal to the make-whole amount. The make-whole amount is calculated as the present value of all interest payments that would have been made on the amount prepaid from the date of the prepayment to December 15, 2019 (or June 15, 2019 if the prepayment is made on or after June 15, 2018) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of


	9.75 percent


	 plus the greater of


	1.25 percent


	 and the Eurodollar rate in effect on the date of the repayment.




	2013 ABL Credit Facility




	On August 7, 2013, we entered into a


	five


	-year asset based senior revolving credit facility maturing on


	August 7, 2018


	 with Bank of America, N.A. serving as sole administrative agent for the lenders thereunder, collateral agent, issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended, the “2013 ABL Credit Facility”).




	The aggregate amount of commitments for the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is currently comprised of


	$80.0 million


	 for the U.S. facility (the “U.S. Facility”) and


	$20.0 million


	 for the Canadian facility (the “Canadian Facility”). The 2013 ABL Credit Facility includes a sublimit of


	$80.0 million


	 for letters of credit. The borrowers under the U.S. Facility consist of all of our U.S. operating subsidiaries with assets included in the borrowing base, and the U.S. Facility is guaranteed by Willbros Group, Inc. and its material U.S. subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries. The borrower under the Canadian Facility is Willbros Construction Services (Canada) LP, and the Canadian Facility is guaranteed by Willbros Group, Inc. and all of its material U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries.

	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	Advances under the U.S. and Canadian Facilities are limited to a borrowing base consisting of the sum of the following, less applicable reserves:













	•






	85 percent


	 of the value of “eligible accounts”;
















	•






	the lesser of (i)


	75 percent


	 of the value of “eligible unbilled accounts” and (ii)


	$33.0 million


	 minus the amount of eligible unbilled accounts then included in the borrowing base; and
















	•






	“eligible pledged cash”.







	We are also required, as part of our borrowing base calculation, to include a minimum of


	$25.0 million


	 of the net proceeds of the sale of Bemis and the balance of the


	Professional Services


	 segment as eligible pledged cash. We have included


	$40.0 million


	 as eligible pledged cash in our


	December 31, 2016


	 borrowing base calculation, which is included in “Restricted cash” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.




	The aggregate amount of the borrowing base attributable to eligible accounts and eligible unbilled accounts constituting certain progress or milestone billings, retainage and other performance-based benchmarks may not exceed


	$23.0 million


	.




	Advances in U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR or the U.S. or Canadian base rate plus an additional margin. Advances in Canadian dollars bear interest at the Bankers Acceptance (“BA”) Equivalent Rate or the Canadian prime rate plus an additional margin.




	The interest rate margins will be adjusted each quarter based on our fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of the previous quarter as follows:



























	Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio






	 






	U.S. Base Rate, Canadian




	Base Rate and Canadian

	≤1.15 to 1






	 






	1.75%






	 






	2.75%










	We will also pay an unused line fee on each of the U.S. and Canadian Facilities equal to


	50


	 basis points when usage under the applicable facility during the preceding calendar month is less than


	50


	 percent of the commitments or


	37.5


	 basis points when usage under the applicable facility equals or exceeds


	50


	 percent of the commitments for such period. With respect to the letters of credit, we will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable LIBOR margin, shown in the table above, on all letters of credit and a


	0.125


	 percent fronting fee to the issuing bank, in each case, payable monthly in arrears.




	Obligations under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the borrowers’ and guarantors’ accounts receivable, deposit accounts and similar assets and a second priority security interest in the 2014 Term Loan Priority Collateral.




	Debt Covenants and Events of Default




	A default under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or other covenants under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, a failure to make payments when due under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, a failure to make payments when due in respect of, or a failure to perform obligations relating to, debt obligations in excess of


	$15.0 million


	, a change of control of the Company and certain insolvency proceedings. A default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding cash advances with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations. A default under the 2014 Term Loan Facility would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable thereunder.




	On March 31, 2015 (the “First Amendment Closing Date”), March 1, 2016, July 26, 2016 and March 3, 2017, we amended the 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”), a Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”), a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) and a Fifth Amendment (the "Fifth Amendment"). These amendments, among other things, suspend the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from December 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 (the “Covenant Suspension Periods”) so that any failure by us to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio during the Covenant Suspension Periods will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default.








	39









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	In consideration of the initial suspension of the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the First Amendment, we issued


	10.1 million


	 shares, which was equivalent to


	19.9 percent


	 of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the First Amendment Closing Date, to KKR Lending Partners II L.P. and other entities indirectly advised by KKR Credit Advisers (US) LLC, which made them a related party. In connection with this transaction, we recorded debt covenant suspension charges of approximately


	$33.5 million


	 which represented the fair value of the


	10.1 million


	 outstanding shares of common stock issued, multiplied by the closing stock price on the First Amendment Closing Date. In addition, we recorded debt extinguishment charges of approximately


	$0.8 million


	 related to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with our 2014 Term Credit Agreement.




	In consideration for the Third and Fourth Amendment, we paid a total of


	$4.6 million


	 in amendment fees in 2016. The amendment fees are recorded as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the 2014 Term Loan Facility in accordance with ASU 2015-03, which we retroactively adopted effective January 1, 2016. We are amortizing the amendment fees through the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, using the effective interest method.




	Due to operating losses driven, in part, by an overall lower volume of work and significant losses on a cross-country pipeline project in Canada, combined with our current forecast, we did not expect to be in compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017.




	The Fifth Amendment suspends compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants through June 30, 2017. In addition, under the Fifth Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio will be


	5.50


	 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will decrease to


	4.50


	 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018, and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio will be


	1.60


	 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will increase to

	 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 2.75 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The Fifth Amendment also provides that, for the four-quarter period ending September 30, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 multiplied by two, and, for the four-quarter period ending December 31, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the annualized sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment also permits us to retain the net proceeds of the sale of our tank services business for working capital purposes. In consideration for the Fifth Amendment, we paid an amendment fee of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.




	Concurrent with the effectiveness of the Fifth Amendment, coupled with our current forecasts, cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, we expect to meet our required financial covenants and have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months; however, our results of operations will need to improve in 2017 in order to meet our forecasts and required financial covenants.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we did not have any outstanding revolver borrowings, and our unused availability was


	$40.3 million


	, net of outstanding letters of credit of


	$48.5 million


	 and cash collateral of


	$40.0 million


	. If our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the greater of (i) 


	15.0


	 percent of the revolving commitments or


	$15.0 million


	 for five consecutive days, or (ii) 


	12.5


	 percent of the revolving commitments or


	$12.5 million


	 at any time, or upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, we are subject to increased reporting requirements, the administrative agent shall have exclusive control over any deposit account, we will not have any right of access to, or withdrawal from, any deposit account, or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account, and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility. In addition, if our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the amounts described above, we would be required to comply with a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of


	1.15


	 to 1.00. Based on our current forecasts, we do not expect our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility to be less than the amounts described above and therefore do not expect the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to be applicable over the next twelve months. If the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were to become applicable, we would not expect to be in compliance over the next twelve months and would therefore be in default under our credit agreements.




	The 2014 Term Credit Agreement and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility also includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including:













	•






	the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP;
















	•






	the identification of any events or circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, properties or condition of the Company;

	Cash Balances




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had cash and cash equivalents of


	$41.4 million


	. Our cash and cash equivalent balances held in the United States and foreign countries were


	$29.3 million


	 and


	$12.1 million


	, respectively. In 2011, we discontinued our strategy of reinvesting non-U.S. earnings in foreign operations. Accordingly, we may repatriate foreign cash for corporate purposes without incurring additional tax expense.




	Our working capital position for continuing operations


	decreased




	$32.8 million


	 to


	$90.4 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016




	from


	$123.2 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	, primarily attributable to a lower volume of work where reductions in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue exceeded reductions in accounts payable. We continue to take the necessary measures to improve liquidity including an increased focus on cash collections; however, our days sales outstanding was


	66 days


	 and


	 60 days


	 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	Cash Flows




	Statements of cash flows for entities with international operations that use the local currency as the functional currency exclude the effects of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during any given period, as these are non-cash charges. As a result, changes reflected in certain accounts on the


	Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows


	 may not reflect the changes in corresponding accounts on the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Cash flows provided by (used in) continuing operations by type of activity were as follows for years ended

	Operating Activities




	Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins and the type of services we provide but can also be influenced by working capital needs such as the timing of collection of receivables and the settlement of payables and other obligations. Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months when the majority of our capital-intensive projects are executed. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the late fall and winter months.




	Operating activities from continuing operations


	used


	 net cash of


	$12.0 million


	 in


	2016


	 as compared to


	$46.0 million




	provided


	 in


	2015


	. The


	$58.0 million


	 decrease in operating cash flow is primarily a result of the following:













	•






	A decrease in cash flow provided by accounts receivable of


	$83.4 million


	 primarily related to a decrease in customer cash collections resulting from a lower volume of work and a lower receivable balance during the period; and
















	•






	A decrease in cash flow provided by continuing operations, adjusted for any non-cash items, of


	$18.2 million


	 primarily related to a reduction of net income year-over-year.







	This was partially offset by:













	•






	A decrease in cash flow used by accounts payable of


	$36.3 million


	 attributed primarily to reduced vendor payments resulting from a lower volume of work during the period;
















	•






	A decrease in cash flow used by other assets and liabilities of


	$6.4 million


	 attributed primarily to changes in business activity during the period.

	 related to an increase in customer cash collections during the period;
















	•






	An increase in cash flow provided by continuing operations of


	$14.7 million


	 attributed primarily to a decrease in net loss from continuing operations, adjusted for any non-cash items; and
















	•






	A decrease in cash flow used by accrued income taxes of


	$8.0 million


	 related to a decrease in cash paid for income taxes in 2015 and decreased profitability on our Canada segment in 2015 compared to 2014.







	This was partially offset by:













	•






	An increase in cash flow used by accounts payable of


	$14.5 million


	 attributed primarily to an increase of cash payments to vendors during the period as we balance our receivable collections with our vendor payments;
















	•






	A decrease in cash flow provided by contracts in progress of


	$12.4 million


	 related to decreased billings on projects during the period; and
















	•






	An increase in cash flow used by other assets and liabilities of


	$9.2 million


	 primarily related to increased cash payments and decreased cash receipts during the period.







	Investing Activities




	Investing activities from continuing operations


	provided


	 net cash of


	$10.8 million


	 in


	2016


	 as compared to


	$210.4 million


	 in


	2015


	. The


	$199.6 million




	decrease


	 in investing cash flow is primarily the result of a


	2016


	 decrease of


	$223.5 million


	 in cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries, as


	2015


	 included the sale of the balance of our


	Professional Services


	 segment, as well as the sale of our Premier, UtilX, Downstream Professional Services and Bemis subsidiaries. In addition, the decrease in investing cash flow is partly attributed to a reduction in cash proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of


	$5.2 million


	 and an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment of


	$1.1 million


	. The overall decrease in investing cash flow was partially offset by a reduction in restricted cash deposits of


	$30.2 million


	 in comparison to


	2015


	.

	 in


	2014


	. The


	$167.9 million




	increase


	 in investing cash flow is primarily the result of an increase of


	$188.4 million


	 in cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries identified above in


	2015


	 as compared to


	2014


	 as well as a reduction in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment of


	$8.9 million


	 and an increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of property, plant and equipment of


	$5.9 million


	. The overall increase in investing cash flow was partially offset by a $35.2 million deposit of restricted cash for collateralization of our outstanding letters of credit.




	Financing Activities




	Financing activities from continuing operations


	used


	 net cash of


	$8.6 million

	2016


	 as compared to


	$177.3 million


	 in


	2015


	. The


	$168.7 million


	 increase in financing cash flow is primarily related to a


	$171.5 million


	 reduction in payments against our Term Loan in


	2016


	. The overall increase in financing cash flow is partially offset by a


	$3.8 million


	 increase in debt issuance costs in


	2016


	, primarily composed of amendment fees paid in connection with the Third and Fourth Amendments.




	Financing activities from continuing operations


	used


	 net cash of

	 in


	2015


	 as compared to


	$2.7 million


	 in


	2014


	. The


	$174.6 million


	 decrease in financing cash flow is primarily related to the fact that we did not issue a new Term Loan in 2015 as compared to $270.0 million in cash proceeds received in 2014 from our new Term Loan. The remaining decrease in financing cash flow is primarily related to a


	$24.6 million


	 decrease in proceeds received from our revolver and notes payable. The overall decrease in financing cash flow was partially offset by a


	$74.7 million


	 reduction in payments against our Term Loan in


	2015


	 and a


	$44.1 million

	used


	 of


	$40.2 million


	 in


	2015


	. The


	$32.6 million


	 increase in discontinued operations cash flow is primarily due to a reduction in activity between periods with respect to services previously associated with our


	Professional Services


	 segment.

	$37.3 million


	 in


	2014


	. The


	$2.9 million

	Interest Rate Risk




	We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment of cash and cash equivalents arising in the normal course of business and have previously entered into hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest costs of our variable interest rate borrowings.




	Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreement




	In August 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap Agreement”) for a notional amount of 


	$124.1 million


	 to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on 


	$124.1 million


	 of our existing or replacement LIBOR indexed debt. The Swap Agreement was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedging instrument with the effective portion of the Swap Agreement's change in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). The Swap Agreement was highly effective in offsetting changes in interest expense, and no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. The Swap Agreement was terminated in the third quarter of 2015 for 


	$5.7 million


	, which was recorded in OCI at fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we made an early payment of 


	$93.6 million


	 against our 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately 


	$1.2 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. In the first quarter of 2016, we made an early payment of 


	$3.1 million


	 against our 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately 


	$0.1 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. The remaining fair value of the Swap Agreement included in OCI will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt with approximately 


	$1.1 million


	 expected to be recognized in the coming twelve months.




	Capital Requirements




	Our financing objective is to maintain financial flexibility to meet the material, equipment and personnel needs to support our project and MSA commitments. Our primary source of capital is our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL Credit Facility.




	In


	2016


	, capital expenditures by segment amounted to


	$0.3 million


	 spent by


	Oil & Gas


	,


	$0.7 million


	 spent by


	Canada


	,


	$2.5 million


	 spent by


	Utility T&D,


	 and


	$0.3 million


	 spent by Corporate, for a total of


	$3.8 million


	. Our industry remains capital intensive, and we expect the need for capital expenditures to increase in the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. As such, we are focused on providing working capital for projects in process and those scheduled to begin in


	2017


	, as well as funding our


	2017


	 capital budget.




	Given our cash on hand and our ABL availability, we believe that our financial results combined with our current liquidity and working capital management will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our future operating needs and our planned capital expenditures, as well as facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future. Should we experience rapid growth, we may need to access capital markets to meet our working capital requirements.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments




	From time to time, we enter into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or surety bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services. In such cases, the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or surety bonds in lieu of








	43









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	contract retention provisions, in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period.




	The letters of credit represent the maximum amount of payments we could be required to make if these letters of credit are drawn upon. Additionally, we issue surety bonds customarily required by commercial terms on construction projects. U.S. surety bonds represent the bond penalty amount of future payments we could be required to make if we fail to perform our obligations under such contracts. The surety bonds do not have a stated expiration date; rather, each is released when the contract is accepted by the owner. Our maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, no liability has been recognized for letters of credit or surety bonds.

	Certain operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and insured against through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program. We maintain worldwide master commercial insurance policies written through highly-rated insurers in types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the project management and construction industry. These policies cover our property, plant, equipment and cargo against normally-insurable risks. Other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations. Primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with industry standards for the level of our operations and asset base. Risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients. On other projects, “builders all risk insurance” is purchased when deemed necessary. All insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level except for certain basic insurance that must be purchased locally to comply with insurance laws.




	The insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective in all circumstances or against all hazards. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the future, our ability to maintain insurance, which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable, may be affected by events over which we have no control.




	We have been limited in our pursuit of certain larger projects due, in part, to our current balance sheet and bonding capacity. In addition to our other efforts to improve our financial position, we are exploring opportunities to partner with other contractors, which will enable us to work on these larger-scale projects.




	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES




	Revenue




	A number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue. We typically structure contracts as unit-price, time and materials, fixed-price or cost plus fixed fee. We believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work, cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized. Revenue from unit-price and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned.




	Revenue for fixed-price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project’s completion and thus the estimated amount and








	44









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements









	timing of revenue recognition. Certain fixed-price and cost plus fixed fee contracts include, or are amended to include, incentive bonus amounts, contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone. Revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed. We do not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined.




	We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change, but not for price associated with that scope change. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the amount is estimable. Revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in "Contract costs and recognized income not yet billed" on the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. Revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.




	We consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes. Revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred.




	Our operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was positively impacted by approximately


	$7.6 million


	 and


	$5.6 million


	, as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These changes in contract estimates are primarily attributed to, among other things, a reduction in estimated costs for certain individually immaterial projects as they progress to completion; the realization of change orders related to work previously performed; and other changes in events, facts and circumstances during the period in which the estimate was revised.




	Valuation of Intangible Assets




	Our intangible assets with finite lives include customer relationships and trade names. The value of customer relationships is estimated using the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings method consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.




	We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for an impairment test of intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. For additional information, see


	Note 6 – Intangible Assets


	 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.




	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets




	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. This evaluation, as well as an evaluation of our other intangible assets, requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our services and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value (less selling costs) of such asset and its carrying value. Such expense would be reflected in earnings.

	Insurance




	We are insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, auto liability and general liability claims, subject to a deductible of


	$1.0 million


	 per occurrence. Additionally, our largest non-union employee-related health care benefit plan is subject to a deductible of


	$0.3 million


	 per claimant per year.




	Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred (including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported), with assistance from third-party actuaries. For these claims, to the extent we have insurance coverage above the deductible amounts, we have recorded a receivable reflected in “Other long-term assets” in our


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends.




	Income Taxes




	The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the determination of our valuation allowance and adjust the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. The provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed profit rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects.




	We record reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future

	 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.




	EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES




	Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation, government mandates or other economic factors, in the countries in which we operate. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work.

	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk




	Interest Rate Risk




	We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment of cash and cash equivalents arising in the normal course of business and have entered into hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest costs of our variable interest rate borrowings.




	Under our 2014 Term Loan Facility, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by


	$0.9 million


	. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease interest expense by


	$0.9 million


	.




	Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreement




	In August 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap Agreement”) for a notional amount of 


	$124.1 million


	 to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on 


	$124.1 million


	 of our existing or replacement LIBOR indexed debt. The Swap Agreement was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedging instrument with the effective portion of the Swap Agreement's change in fair value recorded in OCI. The Swap Agreement was highly effective in offsetting changes in interest expense, and no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. The Swap Agreement was terminated in the third quarter of 2015 for 


	$5.7 million


	, which was recorded in OCI at fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we made an early payment of 


	$93.6 million


	 against our 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately 


	$1.2 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. In the first quarter of 2016, we made an early payment of 


	$3.1 million


	 against our 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately 


	$0.1 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. The remaining fair value of the Swap Agreement included in OCI will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt with approximately 


	$1.1 million


	 expected to be recognized in the coming twelve months.




	Foreign Currency Risk




	We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. To mitigate our risk, we may borrow Canadian dollars under our Canadian Facility to settle U.S. dollar account balances.




	We attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, we seek to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent we are unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expense in the same currency, we may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. We had no forward contracts or options at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willbros Group, Inc.









	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Willbros Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index






	presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control - Integrated Framework


	 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.









	A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.









	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	Company


	 – Willbros Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Willbros” or “WGI”), is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction, maintenance and facilities development services. The Company’s principal markets for continuing operations are the United States and Canada. The Company obtains its work through competitive bidding and through negotiations with prospective clients. Contract values range from several thousand dollars to several hundred million dollars, and contract durations range from a few weeks to more than


	two


	 years. The Company has


	three


	 reportable segments:


	Oil & Gas


	,


	Utility T&D


	 and


	Canada


	.




	The Company's


	Oil & Gas


	 segment provides construction, maintenance and lifecycle extension services to the midstream markets. These services include pipeline construction to support the transportation and storage of hydrocarbons, including gathering, lateral and main-line pipeline systems, as well as, facilities construction such as pump stations, flow stations, gas compressor stations and metering stations. In addition, the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment provides integrity construction, pipeline systems maintenance and tank services to a number of different customers.




	At December 31, 2016, the assets and liabilities associated with tank services have been classified as held for sale. See


	Note 4 - Assets Held for Sale


	 for more information.




	The Company's


	Utility T&D


	 segment provides a wide range of services in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution, including comprehensive engineering, procurement, maintenance and construction, repair and restoration of utility infrastructure.




	The Company's


	Canada


	 segment provides construction, maintenance and fabrication services, including integrity and supporting civil work, pipeline construction, general mechanical and facility construction, API storage tanks, general and modular fabrication, along with electrical and instrumentation projects serving the Canadian energy and water industries.




	Discontinued Operations


	 – On November 30, 2015, the Company sold the balance of its


	Professional Services


	 segment to TRC Companies (“TRC”). As such, the


	Professional Services


	 segment, including Willbros Engineers, LLC and Willbros Heater Services, LLC (collectively "Downstream Professional Services"), Premier Utility Services, LLC (“Premier”) and UtilX Corporation (“UtilX”), which were sold earlier in 2015, are presented as discontinued operations in the Company's


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	. These subsidiaries, coupled with assets comprising the Company's CTS business that was sold in 2014 (“CTS”) and assets comprising the Company's Hawkeye business that was sold in 2013 (“Hawkeye”), are referred to as the “Discontinued Operations.” Assets and liabilities related to the Discontinued Operations are included in the line item “Assets associated with discontinued operations,” “Current liabilities associated with discontinued operations” and “Long-term liabilities associated with discontinued operations” on the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 for all periods presented. The results of the Discontinued Operations are included in the line item “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of provision for income taxes” on the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for all periods presented. See


	Note 17 – Discontinued Operations


	 for more information.




	Principles of Consolidation


	 – The


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 of the Company include all of its majority-owned subsidiaries and all of its wholly-owned entities. Inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The ownership interest of noncontrolling participants in subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned is included as a separate component of equity. These subsidiaries were sold in 2015.




	Use of Estimates


	 – The


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States and include certain estimates and assumptions made by management of the Company in the preparation of the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	. These estimates and assumptions relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, including estimates of progress towards completion and estimates of gross profit or loss accrual on contracts in progress; tax accruals and certain other accrued liabilities; quantification of amounts recorded for contingencies; valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred income tax assets; and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes relevant under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)













	Reclassifications


	 – Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications primarily relate to the impact of the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements during the year.




	Commitments and Contingencies


	 – Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when management assesses that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of costs from third parties, which management assesses as being probable of realization, are recorded as “Other long-term assets” in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. Legal costs incurred in connection with matters relating to contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. See


	Note 14 – Contingencies, Commitments and Other Circumstances


	 for more information.




	Accounts Receivable




	–


	 Most of the accounts receivable and contract work in progress are from clients in the oil, gas, refinery, petrochemical and power industries in North America. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Most contracts require payments as the projects progress or, in certain cases, advance payments. The Company generally does not require collateral, but in most cases can place liens against the property, plant or equipment constructed or terminate the contract if a material default occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the probable amount of credit losses in the Company’s existing accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables. Relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer and prior collection history. Balances over


	90 days


	 past due are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection are exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The allowance requirements are based on the most current facts available and are re-evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis and as additional information is received.




	Inventories


	 – Inventories, consisting primarily of parts and supplies, are stated at the lower of actual cost or market. Parts and supplies are evaluated at least annually and adjusted for excess and obsolescence.


	No


	 excess or obsolescence allowances existed at


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	2015


	.




	Property, Plant and Equipment


	 – Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation, including amortization of capital leases, is provided on the straight-line method using estimated lives as follows:




	 























	Construction equipment






	 






	3-20 years








	Furniture and equipment






	 






	3-12 years








	Buildings






	 






	20 years








	Transportation equipment






	 






	3-17 years








	Marine equipment






	 






	10 years










	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized within “Operating expenses” in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for the period. Normal repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.




	The Company depreciates assets based on their estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition using the straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization related to operating activities is included in “Contract costs,” and depreciation and amortization related to general and administrative activities is included in “General and administrative” expense in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. “Contract costs” and “General and administrative” expenses are included within “Operating expenses” in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. Further, amortization of assets under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation expense.




	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. This

	Index to Financial Statements





	WILLBROS GROUP, INC.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS









	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)













	evaluation, as well as an evaluation of our other intangible assets, requires the Company to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Company’s services and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and the Company’s projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value (less selling costs) of such asset and its carrying value. Such expense would be reflected in earnings.




	Intangible Assets –


	 The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives include customer relationships and trade names. The value of customer relationships is estimated using the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings method consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to the Company’s business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.




	The Company amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for an impairment test of intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.




	Revenue




	–


	 A number of factors relating to the Company’s business affect the recognition of contract revenue. The Company typically structures contracts as unit-price, time and materials, fixed-price or cost plus fixed fee. The Company believes that its operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work, cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized. Revenue from unit-price and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned.




	Revenue for fixed-price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project’s completion and thus the estimated amount and timing of revenue recognition. Certain fixed-price and cost plus fixed fee contracts include, or are amended to include, incentive bonus amounts, contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone. Revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed. The Company does not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined.




	The Company considers unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which the Company has customer approval for scope change, but not for price associated with that scope change. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the amount is estimable. Revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in “Contract cost and recognized income not yet billed” on the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. Revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.




	The Company considers claims to be amounts that the Company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes. Revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur

	until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred.




	The Company's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was positively impacted by approximately


	$7.6 million


	 and


	$5.6 million


	, as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These changes in contract estimates are primarily attributed to, among other things, a reduction in estimated costs for certain individually immaterial projects as they progress to completion; the realization of change orders related to work previously performed; and other changes in events, facts and circumstances during the period in which the estimate was revised.




	Insurance


	– The Company is insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, auto liability and general liability claims, subject to a deductible of


	$1.0 million


	 per occurrence. Additionally, the Company’s largest non-union employee-related health care benefit plan is subject to a deductible of


	$0.3 million


	 per claimant per year.




	Losses are accrued based upon the Company’s estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred (including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported), with assistance from third-party actuaries. For these claims, to the extent insurance coverage is above the deductible amounts, the Company has recorded a receivable reflected in “Other long-term assets” in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of the Company’s liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends.




	Income Taxes


	 – The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.




	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards, including federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in a particular tax jurisdiction during the periods in which the use of such net operating losses are allowed. The Company considers future taxable income, including the impacts of reversing taxable temporary differences, future forecasted income and available tax planning strategies, when evaluating whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized prior to expiration.




	The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, in various states and in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination for 2008 forward for the United States and the majority of the state jurisdictions and for 2007 forward in Canada.




	Retirement Plans and Benefits


	 – The Company has a voluntary defined contribution retirement plan for U.S. based employees that is qualified and contributory on the part of the employees. Additionally, the Company is subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. As a result, the Company participates with other companies in the unions’ multi-employer pension and other postretirement benefit plans.




	Stock-Based Compensation




	–


	 Compensation cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions is recognized in the financial statements measured based on the grant-date fair value of the instrument issued and is recognized over the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method to determine the fair value of stock options granted as of the grant date. Share-based compensation related to restricted stock and restricted stock units or rights, also described collectively as restricted stock units, is recorded based on the Company’s closing stock price as of the grant date. Awards granted are expensed ratably over the vesting period of the award.




	Foreign Currency Translation


	 – All significant monetary asset and liability accounts denominated in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at current exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included in “Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax” in the Company's


	Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive

	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)













	Income/(Loss)


	. Revenue and expense accounts are converted at prevailing rates throughout the year. Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in income in the period in which they are incurred.




	Concentration of Credit Risk




	–


	 The Company has a concentration of customers in the oil and gas and power industries which expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk within a single industry. The Company seeks to obtain advance and progress payments for contract work performed on major contracts. Receivables are generally not collateralized. An allowance for doubtful accounts of


	$2.0 million


	 and


	$4.5 million


	 is included within “Accounts receivable, net” on the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively.




	Income (Loss) per Common Share


	 – Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss), less any preferred dividend requirements, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by including the weighted average number of all potentially dilutive common shares with the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.




	Derivative Financial Instruments


	 – The Company may use derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques to mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk when the Company is unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expense in the same currency. The Company has


	no


	 forward contracts or options at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.




	The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and investment of cash and cash equivalents arising in the normal course of business and has previously entered into hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest cost of the variable interest rate borrowings.




	Cash Equivalents –


	 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of


	three months or less


	 to be cash equivalents.




	Short-term Investments


	 – The Company may invest a portion of its cash in short-term time deposits, some of which may have early withdrawal penalties. All such deposits have maturity dates that exceed


	three months


	. There were


	no


	 short-term investments outstanding as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.




	Accounting Pronouncements Recently




	Adopted


	 – In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as related valuation allowances, to be classified as non-current. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the standard retroactively for all periods presented. As a result of this adoption, current deferred taxes and non-current deferred taxes decreased


	$2.3 million


	 at December 31, 2015 in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs with the requirement that debt issuance costs related to a debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the standard retroactively for all periods presented. The application of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures, if required. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted ASU 2014-15 in the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 8 - Long-term Debt for more information.




	Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted


	 – In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires a reporting entity to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in its cash and cash-equivalent balances presented in the entity's statement of cash flows. A reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows








	60









	Table of Contents











	Index to Financial Statements





	WILLBROS GROUP, INC.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS









	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)













	must be disclosed when the balance sheet includes more than one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Transfers between non-restricted and restricted cash should not be presented as cash flow activities in the statement of cash flows. Furthermore, an entity with a material restricted cash balance must disclose information regarding the nature of the restrictions. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately


	$40.2 million


	 and


	$35.2 million


	 is recorded as "Restricted Cash" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. These amounts are primarily composed of eligible pledged cash in the Company's December 31, 2016 and 2015 borrowing base calculation.




	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires a reporting entity to recognize the tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller's tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. The new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory, and the income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	.




	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which provides specific guidance for cash flow classifications of cash payments and receipts to reduce the diversity of treatment of such items. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	.




	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	.




	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires companies that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those assets. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not been previously issued. The Company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	. Based on an initial evaluation, the Company expects to include operating leases with durations greater than twelve months on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will provide additional information about the expected financial impact as it progresses through the evaluation and implementation of the standard.




	In May 2014, the FASB and the IASB issued ASU 2014-09 surrounding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new standard, a company will recognize revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. Revenue will be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard to December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application. Furthermore, in March, April, and May of 2016, the FASB issued ASUs 2016-08, 2016-10, and 2016-12, respectively, which provide practical expedients and clarification in regards to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 amends and clarifies the principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue recognition standard, which requires determination of whether the nature of a promise is to provide the specified good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by another party (that is, the entity is an agent); this determination affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. ASU 2016-10 clarifies issues related to identifying performance obligations. ASU 2016-12 provides practical expedients and clarification pertaining to the exclusion of sales tax from the measurement of a transaction price, the measurement of non-cash consideration, allocation of a transaction price on the basis of all satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations in a modified contract at transition, and the definition of a completed contract. The effective date of ASUs 2016-08, 2016-10, and 2016-12 is December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of these standards on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of its evaluation, the Company is holding regular meetings with key stakeholders from across the organization to discuss

	the impact of the standards on its existing contracts. The Company is utilizing a bottoms-up approach to analyze the impact of the standards on its portfolio of contracts by reviewing its current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standards to its existing revenue contracts. The Company expects to complete its evaluation and adopt these standards effective January 1, 2018.

	2014


	, respectively.




	The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on the Company’s experience with similar contracts within recent years, the majority of the retention balances at each balance sheet date will be collected within the next twelve months.








	3. Contracts in Progress




	Contract cost and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts arise when recorded revenues for a contract exceed the amounts billed under the terms of the contracts. Contract billings in excess of cost and recognized income arise when billed amounts exceed revenues recorded. Amounts are billable to customers upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of the contract.

	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company, as part of its ongoing strategic evaluation, made the decision to offer for sale its tank services business, which is included in the Company's


	Oil & Gas


	 segment. The tank services business, which is being actively marketed to outside parties, is expected to sell within one year and is measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. As a result, the related assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2016.




	In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately


	$3.3 million


	 related to property, plant and equipment in the


	Oil & Gas


	 and


	 Utility T&D


	 segments, which were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015. The held for sale property, plant and equipment in the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment was approximately


	$3.4 million


	 and related to the segment's fabrication services which was actively marketed for sale at December 31, 2015 and subsequently sold in 2016. The held for sale property, plant and equipment in the


	Utility T&D


	 segment was approximately


	$0.4 million


	 and was also being actively marketed to outside parties and auction groups at December 31, 2015 and subsequently sold in 2016. The total impairment charges, which were recorded to measure the equipment at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, are included in operating expenses in the Company's

	2014 Term Loan Facility




	On December 15, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2014 Term Credit Agreement”) among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. Cortland Capital Market Services LLC serves as administrative agent under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement.




	The 2014 Term Credit Agreement provides for a


	five


	-year


	$270.0 million


	 term loan facility (the “2014 Term Loan Facility”), which the Company drew in full on the effective date of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement. The Company is the borrower under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement, with all of its obligations guaranteed by its material U.S. subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries. Obligations under the 2014 Term Loan Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in, among other things, the borrower’s and the guarantors’ equipment, subsidiary capital stock and intellectual property (the “2014 Term Loan Priority Collateral”) and a second priority security interest in, among other things, the borrower’s and the guarantors’ inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and similar assets.




	The term loans bear interest at the “Adjusted Base Rate” plus an applicable margin of


	8.75 percent


	, or the “Eurodollar Rate” plus an applicable margin of


	9.75 percent


	. The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was


	11 percent


	, comprised of an applicable margin of


	9.75 percent


	 for Eurodollar rate loans plus a LIBOR floor of


	1.25 percent


	.




	The Company made early payments of


	$3.1 million


	 and


	$78.3 million


	 against the 2014 Term Loan Facility during the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively. As a result of these early payments, the Company recorded debt extinguishment charges of


	$0.1 million


	 and


	$1.9 million


	, respectively, which consisted of prepayment fees of


	2 percent


	 and the write-off of debt issuance costs.




	The Company is also required to pay a repayment fee on the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility equal to


	5.0 percent


	 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the maturity date. The repayment fee was contingent upon the sale of the Company's


	Professional Services


	 segment, which was completed on November 30, 2015. As a result, the Company is amortizing the repayment fee as a discount, from that date through the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, using the effective interest method. The unamortized amount of the repayment fee is


	$3.6 million


	 and


	$4.6 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	Since December 31, 2014, the Company has significantly reduced the balance under the 2014 Term Loan Facility. Under the provisions of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement, with respect to prepayments made from inception of the Term Loan through


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has not been required to pay prepayment premiums in respect of the “make-whole amount.”




	However, future prepayments or refinancing of the balance of the 2014 Term Loan Facility will, in most cases, require the Company to pay a prepayment premium equal to the make-whole amount. The make-whole amount is calculated as the present value of all interest payments that would have been made on the amount prepaid from the date of the prepayment to December 15, 2019 (or June 15, 2019 if the prepayment is made on or after June 15, 2018) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of


	9.75 percent


	 plus the greater of


	1.25 percent


	 and the Eurodollar rate in effect on the date of the repayment.

	2013 ABL Credit Facility




	On August 7, 2013 the Company entered into a


	five


	-year asset based senior revolving credit facility maturing on


	August 7, 2018


	 with Bank of America, N.A. serving as sole administrative agent for the lenders thereunder, collateral agent, issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended, the “2013 ABL Credit Facility”).




	The aggregate amount of commitments for the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is currently comprised of


	$80.0 million


	 for the U.S. facility (the “U.S. Facility”) and


	$20.0 million


	 for the Canadian facility (the “Canadian Facility”). The 2013 ABL Credit Facility includes a sublimit of


	$80.0 million


	 for letters of credit. The borrowers under the U.S. Facility consist of all of the Company’s U.S. operating subsidiaries with assets included in the borrowing base, and the U.S. Facility is guaranteed by Willbros Group, Inc. and its material U.S. subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries. The borrower under the Canadian Facility is Willbros Construction Services (Canada) LP, and the Canadian Facility is guaranteed by Willbros Group, Inc. and all of its material U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, other than excluded subsidiaries.




	Advances under the U.S. and Canadian Facilities are limited to a borrowing base consisting of the sum of the following, less applicable reserves:













	•






	85 percent


	 of the value of “eligible accounts”;
















	•






	the lesser of (i)


	75 percent


	 of the value of “eligible unbilled accounts” and (ii)


	$33.0 million


	 minus the amount of eligible unbilled accounts then included in the borrowing base; and
















	•






	“eligible pledged cash”.







	The Company is also required, as part of its borrowing base calculation, to include a minimum of


	$25.0 million


	 of the net proceeds of the sale of Bemis, LLC and the balance of the


	Professional Services


	 segment as eligible pledged cash. The Company has included


	$40.0 million


	 as eligible pledged cash in its


	December 31, 2016


	 borrowing base calculation, which is included in “Restricted cash” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.




	The aggregate amount of the borrowing base attributable to eligible accounts and eligible unbilled accounts constituting certain progress or milestone billings, retainage and other performance-based benchmarks may not exceed


	$23.0 million


	.




	Advances in U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR or the U.S. or Canadian base rate plus an additional margin. Advances in Canadian dollars bear interest at the Bankers Acceptance (“BA”) Equivalent Rate or the Canadian prime rate plus an additional margin.




	The interest rate margins will be adjusted each quarter based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of the previous quarter as follows:



























	Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio






	 






	U.S. Base Rate, Canadian




	Base Rate and Canadian




	Prime Rate Loans

	2.50%








	≤1.15 to 1






	 






	1.75%






	 






	2.75%










	The Company will also pay an unused line fee on each of the U.S. and Canadian Facilities equal to


	50


	 basis points when usage under the applicable facility during the preceding calendar month is less than


	50


	 percent of the commitments or


	37.5


	 basis points when usage under the applicable facility equals or exceeds


	50


	 percent of the commitments for such period. With respect to the letters of credit, the Company will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable LIBOR margin, shown in the table above, on all letters of credit and a


	0.125


	 percent fronting fee to the issuing bank, in each case, payable monthly in arrears.




	Obligations under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the borrowers’ and guarantors’ accounts receivable, deposit accounts and similar assets and a second priority security interest in the 2014 Term Loan Priority Collateral.

	8. Long-term Debt (continued)








	Debt Covenants and Events of Default




	A default under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or other covenants under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, a failure to make payments when due under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, a failure to make payments when due in respect of, or a failure to perform obligations relating to, debt obligations in excess of


	$15.0 million


	, a change of control of the Company and certain insolvency proceedings. A default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding cash advances with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations. A default under the 2014 Term Loan Facility would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable thereunder.




	On March 31, 2015 (the “First Amendment Closing Date”), March 1, 2016, July 26, 2016 and March 3, 2017, the Company amended the 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”), a Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”), a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) and a Fifth Amendment (the "Fifth Amendment"). These amendments, among other things, suspend the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from December 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 (the “Covenant Suspension Periods”) so that any failure by the Company to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio during the Covenant Suspension Periods shall not be deemed to result in a default or event of default.




	In consideration of the initial suspension of the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the First Amendment, the Company issued


	10.1 million


	 shares, which was equivalent to


	19.9 percent


	 of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the First Amendment Closing Date, to KKR Lending Partners II L.P. and other entities indirectly advised by KKR Credit Advisers (US) LLC, which made them a related party. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded debt covenant suspension charges of approximately


	$33.5 million


	 which represented the fair value of the


	10.1 million


	 outstanding shares of common stock issued, multiplied by the closing stock price on the First Amendment Closing Date. In addition, the Company recorded debt extinguishment charges of approximately


	$0.8 million


	 related to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's 2014 Term Credit Agreement.




	In consideration for the Third and Fourth Amendment, the Company paid a total of


	$4.6 million


	 in amendment fees in 2016. The amendment fees are recorded as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the 2014 Term Loan Facility in accordance with ASU 2015-03, which the Company retroactively adopted effective January 1, 2016. The Company is amortizing the amendment fees through the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, using the effective interest method.




	Due to operating losses driven, in part, by an overall lower volume of work and significant losses on a cross-country pipeline project in Canada, combined with its current forecast, the Company did not expect to be in compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017.




	The Fifth Amendment suspends compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants through June 30, 2017. In addition, under the Fifth Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio will be


	5.50


	 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will decrease to


	4.50


	 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and


	3.00


	 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018, and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio will be


	1.60


	 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will increase to


	2.00


	 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and


	2.75


	 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018, and thereafter. The Fifth Amendment also provides that, for the four-quarter period ending September 30, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 multiplied by two, and, for the four-quarter period ending December 31, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the annualized sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment also permits the Company to retain the net proceeds of the sale of its tank services business for working capital purposes. In consideration for the Fifth Amendment, the Company paid an amendment fee of


	$2.3 million


	 in the first quarter of 2017.




	Concurrent with the effectiveness of the Fifth Amendment, coupled with the Company's current forecasts, cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, the Company expects to meet its required financial covenants and have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months; however, the Company's results of operations will need to improve in 2017 in order to meet its forecasts and required financial covenants.

	 at any time, or upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility, the Company is subject to increased reporting requirements, the administrative agent shall have exclusive control over any deposit account, the Company will not have any right of access to, or withdrawal from, any deposit account, or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account, and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility. In addition, if the Company's unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the amounts described above, the Company would be required to comply with a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of


	1.15


	 to 1.00. Based on its current forecasts, the Company does not expect its unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility to be less than the amounts described above and therefore does not expect the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to be applicable over the next twelve months. If the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were to become applicable, the Company would not expect to be in compliance over the next twelve months and would therefore be in default under its credit agreements.




	The 2014 Term Credit Agreement and the 2013 ABL Credit Facility also includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including:













	•






	the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP;

	9. Retirement Plans and Benefits








	Multiemployer Plans




	The Company contributes to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. Currently, the Company has no intention to withdraw from these plans. The risks of participating in a multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:













	a.






	Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
















	b.






	If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
















	c.






	If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, the employer may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.







	 


	The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employer’s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. The plans do not maintain information on the net assets and actuarial present value of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits allocable to the Company. As such, the amount, if any, for which the Company may be contingently liable, is not ascertainable at this time.




	The majority of the Company’s unionized employees work in the building and construction industry (“B&C”), and therefore, the Company believes it satisfies the criteria for the B&C industry exception under ERISA for those multiemployer pension plans that primarily cover employees in the B&C industry. As a result, the Company does not expect to be assessed a withdrawal liability when it ceases making contributions to those plans after the completion of a project or projects, so long as it does not continue to perform work in the jurisdiction of the pension plan on a non-union basis. The applicability of the B&C industry proviso is fact-specific, so there can be no assurance in any particular situation whether the B&C proviso applies or whether withdrawal liability will be assessed.




	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. For a plan in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply. A number of plans to which the Company’s business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered” or “critical” status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that the Company may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.

	The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan as well as publicly available information per the Department of Labor website and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded.
















	(2)






	The “Subject to Funding Improvement / Rehabilitation Plan” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement(s) to which the plans are subject.







	Based upon the most recent and available plan financial information, the Company made contributions to the Pennsylvania Heavy and Highway Contractors Pension Trust that represented more than


	5 percent


	 of total plan contributions for the 2015 plan year. In regards to the Boilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust, the Company did not contribute to the plan in 2016 and has no collective bargaining agreements related to this plan.




	In addition to the contributions noted above to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, the Company also makes discretionary contributions to defined contribution plans. The zone status outlined above does not apply to defined contribution plans.




	Contributions to all defined contribution and defined benefit plans were


	$6.9 million


	,


	$9.9 million


	 and


	$28.3 million


	 for the years ended

	2014


	, respectively.








	10. Income Taxes




	The Company is domiciled in the United States and operates primarily in the United States and Canada. These countries have different tax regimes and tax rates which affect the consolidated income tax provision of the Company and its effective tax rate. Moreover, losses from one country generally cannot be used to offset taxable income from another country, and some expenses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions receive no tax benefit thereby affecting the effective tax rate.

	The provision (benefit) for income taxes has been determined based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned. The Company and its subsidiaries operating in the United States are subject to federal income tax rates up to


	35 percent


	 and varying state income tax rates and methods of computing tax liabilities. The Company’s principal international continuing operations are in Canada. The Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are subject to a corporate income tax rate of


	27 percent


	. The Company did not have any non-taxable foreign earnings from tax holidays for taxable years


	2014


	 through


	2016


	.




	In April 2011, the Company discontinued its strategy of reinvesting foreign earnings in foreign operations. The Company’s current operating strategy is not to reinvest all earnings of its operations internationally. Instead, dividends are distributed to the U.S. parent or its U.S. affiliates. Due to the current deficit in foreign earnings and profits, the Company does not anticipate a significant tax expense to future repatriations of foreign earnings in the United States.

	The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 was


	$69.3 million


	 and


	$58.4 million


	, respectively.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has remaining U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of


	$59.3 million


	 and state net operating loss carry forwards of


	$6.1 million


	. The Company has a net operating loss carry forward for Australia of


	$2.8 million


	.




	The Company’s U.S. federal net operating losses expire beginning in 2031. The Company’s state net operating losses generally expire


	20 years


	 after the period in which the net operating loss was incurred. After the effect of tax planning strategies, carrybacks of certain federal net operating losses, reversals of existing temporary differences, and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets can be utilized to offset taxable income, the Company does not believe that the remaining net federal deferred tax asset is more likely than not realizable in the foreseeable future.

	Stock Ownership Plans




	In May 1996, the Company established the Willbros Group, Inc. 1996 Stock Plan (the “1996 Plan”) with


	1,125,000


	 shares of common stock authorized for issuance to provide for awards to key employees of the Company. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1996 Plan was increased to


	4,825,000


	 by stockholder approval.




	In 2006, the Company established the 2006 Director Restricted Stock Plan (the “2006 Director Plan”) with


	50,000


	 shares authorized for issuance to grant shares of restricted stock and restricted stock rights to non-employee directors. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2006 Director Plan was increased in 2008 to


	250,000


	, in 2012 to


	550,000


	 and in 2014 to


	750,000


	 by stockholder approval. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the 2006 Director Plan had


	34,717


	 shares available for grant.




	On May 26, 2010, the Company established the Willbros Group, Inc. 2010 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2010 Plan”) with


	2,100,000


	 shares of common stock authorized for issuance (increased in 2012 to


	3,450,000


	 shares and in 2014 to


	6,050,000


	 shares by stockholder approval) to provide for awards to key employees of the Company. All future grants of stock awards to key employees will be made through the 2010 Plan. As a result, the 1996 Plan was frozen. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the 2010 Plan had


	933,650


	 shares available for grant.




	Restricted Stock/Restricted Stock Units




	Restricted stock and restricted stock units or rights, also described collectively as restricted stock units (“RSUs”), granted to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over a


	3


	 to


	4

	11. Stockholders' Equity (continued)













	Stock-based compensation related to RSUs is recorded based on the Company’s closing stock price as of the grant date. Expense from both stock options and RSUs, which is inclusive of both liability-based and equity-based stock awards, totaled


	$4.1 million


	,


	$8.6 million


	 and


	$13.6 million


	, respectively, for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	.




	The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 was


	$5.9 million


	,


	$9.8 million


	 and


	$8.9 million


	, respectively.




	For RSUs, certain provisions allow for accelerated vesting in the event of involuntary termination not for cause or a change of control of the Company. During the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	,


	$0.5 million


	,


	$2.3 million


	 and


	$1.8 million


	, respectively, of compensation expense was recognized due to accelerated vesting of RSUs due to retirements and separation from the Company.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there was a total of


	$3.3 million


	 of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company’s stock ownership plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of


	1.87 years


	.




	For certain of the awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the number of shares that will vest is contingent upon the Company's achievement of certain specified targets. These awards have market conditions and were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table sets forth the assumptions used in the valuations of these awards:




	 































	 






	 






	Year Ended December 31,








	 






	 






	2016

	1.01%






	 






	0.49% - 0.96%






	 






	0.07% - 0.69%










	The volatility inputs were developed based on volatility observed using historical price observations over a look-back period consistent with the contractual terms of the awards. The risk-free interest rate inputs were derived using the US Treasury security rates as of the grant dates. Awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included tranches with varying vesting periods, which resulted in the application of a range of risk-free rates.




	Options




	Options granted to employees generally vest over a


	3


	 to


	4


	 year period. Upon stock option exercise, common shares are issued from treasury stock. Options granted under the 2010 Plan expire


	10 years


	 subsequent to the grant date. The Company determines fair value of stock options as of its grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation method.


	No

	12. Income (Loss) Per Common Share













	Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period and the assumed exercise of potentially dilutive stock options and warrants and vesting of RSUs less the number of treasury shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds using the average market price of the Company’s stock for each of the periods presented.




	Basic and diluted loss per common share is computed as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):

	13. Segment Information













	The Company has


	three


	 reportable segments:


	Oil & Gas


	,


	Utility T&D


	 and


	Canada


	. These segments are comprised of strategic businesses that are defined by the industries or geographic regions they serve. Each segment is managed as an operation with well-established strategic directions and performance requirements. Each segment is led by a separate segment President who reports directly to the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). For additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments, see


	Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


	 for more information.




	The CODM evaluates segment performance using operating income which is defined as contract revenue less contract costs and segment overhead, such as amortization related to intangible assets and general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to the segment. In 2016, the Company implemented a change to its organizational structure such that corporate overhead costs, such as executive management, public company, accounting, tax and professional services, human resources and treasury, are no longer allocated to each segment. These costs are classified as “Corporate” in the tables below. Previously reported segment information has been revised to conform to this new presentation.




	On November 30, 2015, the Company sold the balance of its


	Professional Services


	 segment to TRC. As such, the


	Professional Services


	 segment, including the Company's previously sold subsidiaries in 2015 of Downstream Professional Services, Premier and UtilX, are presented as discontinued operations in the tables below. For additional information, see


	Note 17 – Discontinued Operations


	 for more information.




	The following tables reflect the Company’s operations for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 (in thousands) by its


	three


	 reportable segments.

	Contingencies




	Litigation and Regulatory Matters Related to the Company’s October 21, 2014 Press Release Announcing the Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2014




	After the Company announced it would be restating its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (“USDC”) on October 28, 2014 seeking class action status on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock and alleging damages on their behalf arising from the matters that led to the restatement. The original defendants in the case were the Company, its former chief executive officer, Robert R. Harl, and its current chief financial officer. On January 30, 2015, the court named


	two


	 employee retirement systems as Lead Plaintiffs. Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint, captioned


	 In re Willbros Group, Inc. Securities Litigation


	, on March 31, 2015, adding as a defendant John T. McNabb, II, the former chief executive officer who had succeeded Mr. Harl, and claims regarding the restatement of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014. On June 15, 2015, Lead Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, seeking unspecified damages and asserting violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions in the SEC filings and other public disclosures in 2014, primarily regarding internal controls, the performance of the


	Oil & Gas


	segment, compliance with debt covenants and liquidity, certain financial results and the circumstances surrounding Mr. Harl's departure. On July 27, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the case. At a hearing on May 24, 2016, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On July 22, 2016, the Company filed an answer to the suit denying the remaining allegations in the case, which complain of alleged misrepresentations and omissions in violation of the Act regarding internal controls, the performance of the


	Oil & Gas


	 segment and Mr. Harl's departure. The Company is vigorously defending against the remaining allegations, which the Company believes are without merit. The Company is not able at this time to determine the likelihood of loss, if any, arising from this matter.




	In addition,


	two


	 shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed purportedly on behalf of the Company in connection with the restatement. The first, 


	Markovich v. Harl et al


	, was filed on November 6, 2014 in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The second, 


	Kumararatne v. McNabb et al


	, was filed on March 4, 2015 in the USDC, but was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on April 23, 2015. The 


	Markovich


	 lawsuit named certain current and former officers and members of the Company's board of directors as defendants and the Company as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleged that the officer and board member defendants breached their fiduciary duties by permitting the Company’s internal controls to be inadequate, failing to prevent the restatements, wasting corporate assets, and that the defendants were unjustly enriched. The defendants sought dismissal of the lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to make demand upon the Company’s board to bring the lawsuit, and, on February 23, 2016, the court sustained the defendants’ motion and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. On March 10, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration and asked the court for leave to amend its lawsuit. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion in part, allowing an amended petition, which was filed on April 18, 2016. The Plaintiff’s Second Amended Petition added Ravi Kumararatne as a plaintiff and added claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the former officers and officer and board of director defendants related to the departure of former Company executives, financial controls, and compliance with the Company’s debt covenants. The Company sought dismissal of the amended petition on the grounds the plaintiffs failed to make a demand upon the Company’s board to bring the lawsuit. In response, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Petition on June 24, 2016, purporting to add additional facts to support their allegations, including their allegation that they were excused from making a demand upon the board because, they claimed, such demand would be futile. Believing the claims added by plaintiffs were without merit, the Company sought to dismiss this latest pleading. After hearing argument on the motion, the court issued an order on October 24, 2016, sustaining the Company's objections to plaintiffs' latest pleading and again dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration was denied on December 21, 2016. Plaintiffs' filed a Notice of Appeal on January 20, 2017. The appeal is assigned to the 14



	th



	 Court of Appeals, Houston, Texas.




	Other




	The SEC issued an order of investigation on January 29, 2015 and a subpoena on February 3, 2015, requesting information regarding the restatement of the Company's previously issued Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. The Company provided its full cooperation to the SEC, who on January 25, 2016, sent the Company a letter stating it had concluded its investigation and, based on the information it had, did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company.

	14. Contingencies, Commitments and Other Circumstances (continued)













	In addition to the matters discussed above and in


	Note 17 – Discontinued Operations


	, the Company is party to a number of other legal proceedings. Management believes that the nature and number of these proceedings are typical for a firm of similar size engaged in a similar type of business and that none of these proceedings is material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.




	Commitments




	From time to time, the Company enters into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with the Company’s customers may require the Company to secure letters of credit or surety bonds to secure the Company’s performance of contracted services. In such cases, the letters of credit or bond commitments can be called upon in the event of the Company's failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow the Company to issue letters of credit or surety bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions, where the client otherwise withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period. Retention letters of credit or bond commitments can be called upon in the event of warranty or project completion issues, as prescribed in the contracts. The Company also issues letters of credit from time to time to secure deductible obligations under its workers compensation, automobile and general liability policies. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had approximately


	$48.5 million


	 of outstanding letters of credit. This amount represents the maximum amount of payments the Company could be required to make if these letters of credit are drawn upon. Additionally, the Company issues surety bonds (primarily performance in nature) that are customarily required by commercial terms on construction projects. At


	December 31, 2016


	, these bonds outstanding had a face value at


	$122.1 million


	. This amount represents the bond penalty amount of future payments the Company could be required to make if the Company fails to perform its obligations under such contracts. The performance bonds do not have a stated expiration date; rather, each is released when the Company's performance of the contract is accepted by the owner. The Company’s maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced. As of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	no


	 liability has been recognized for letters of credit or surety bonds.




	Operating Leases




	The Company has certain operating leases for various equipment and office facilities. Rental expense for continuing operations excluding daily rentals and reimbursable rentals under cost plus contracts was


	$23.3 million


	 in


	2016


	,


	$33.0 million


	 in


	2015


	, and


	$30.2 million


	 in


	2014


	.




	Minimum lease commitments under operating leases as of


	December 31, 2016


	, totaled


	$88.6 million


	 and are payable as follows:


	2017


	,


	$22.9 million


	;


	2018


	,


	$18.2 million


	;


	2019


	,


	$13.7 million


	;


	2020


	,


	$10.1 million


	;


	2021


	,


	$9.2 million


	 and thereafter,


	$14.5 million


	.




	Other Circumstances




	In addition to the matter described above, the Company has the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of its work. In addition, the Company acts as prime contractor on a majority of the projects it undertakes and is normally responsible for the performance of the entire project, including subcontract work. Management is not aware of any material exposure related thereto which has not been provided for in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

	15. Fair Value Measurements













	The FASB’s standard on fair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.




	Fair Value Hierarchy




	The FASB’s standard on fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. This standard establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:




	Level 1


	 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	Level 2


	 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.




	 Level 3


	 – Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.




	There were no transfers between levels in


	2016


	, 2015 or 2014.




	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, long-term debt and interest rate contracts. The fair value estimates of the Company’s financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies and approximate carrying value.




	Hedging Arrangements




	The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. To mitigate its risk, the Company may borrow Canadian dollars under its Canadian Facility to settle U.S. dollar account balances.




	The Company attempts to negotiate contracts that provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but it may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, the Company seeks to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent it is unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency, the Company may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. The Company had


	no


	 forward contracts or options at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	.




	The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and investment of cash and cash equivalents arising in the normal course of business and had previously entered into hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest cost of its variable interest rate borrowings.




	Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreement




	In August 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap Agreement”) for a notional amount of


	$124.1 million


	 to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on


	$124.1 million


	 of its existing or replacement LIBOR indexed debt. The Swap Agreement was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedging instrument with the effective portion of the Swap Agreement's change in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). The Swap Agreement was highly effective in offsetting changes in interest expense, and no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. The Swap Agreement was terminated in the third quarter of 2015 for


	$5.7 million


	, which was recorded in OCI at fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company made an early payment of


	$93.6 million


	 against its 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately


	$1.2 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company made an early payment of


	$3.1 million


	 against its 2014 Term Loan Facility and therefore reclassified approximately


	$0.1 million


	 of the fair value of the Swap Agreement from OCI to interest expense. The remaining fair value of the Swap Agreement included in OCI will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt with approximately


	$1.1 million


	 expected to be recognized in the coming twelve months.

	17. Discontinued Operations













	The following disposals qualify for discontinued operations treatment with ASU 2014-08, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2015.




	Professional Services




	On November 30, 2015, the Company sold the balance of its


	 Professional Services


	 segment to TRC for


	$130.0 million


	 in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. At closing, TRC held back


	$7.5 million


	 from the purchase price (the “Holdback Amount”) until the Company effects the novation of a customer contract from one of the subsidiaries sold in the transaction to the Company (or obtains written approval of a subcontract of all the work that is the subject of such contract) and obtains certain consents. If such novation, subcontract or consents are not approved by March 15, 2016, TRC would pay the Holdback Amount to the Company. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a net gain on sale of


	$97.0 million


	 during the year ended December 31, 2015.




	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with TRC on substantially all of the outstanding items related to the sale of the


	Professional Services


	 segment. As a result, the Company received


	$4.6 million


	 during the year ended December 31, 2016 in relation to the sale and inclusive of the final settlement of working capital and the Holdback Amount and recorded


	$2.5 million


	 in charges against the original net gain on sale in relation to working capital and other post-closing adjustments.




	Certain assets and liabilities associated with one


	Professional Services


	 contract were retained by the Company and have been excluded from the transaction.




	In 2015, and prior to the sale of the balance of the


	Professional Services


	 segment, the Company sold the following


	three


	 subsidiaries that were historically part of the


	Professional Services

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision of, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing the reasonable assurance described above.




	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	. In making this assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria established in


	Internal Control - Integrated Framework


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013.




	Based on management’s assessment using the COSO criteria, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated, in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

	Item 9B. Other Information




	On March 3, 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2014 (as amended by the First Amendment dated as of March 31, 2015, the Second Amendment dated as of September 28, 2015, the Resignation of Administrative Agent and Appointment of Administrative Agent Agreement dated as of February 4, 2016, the Third Amendment dated as of March 1, 2016, and the Fourth Amendment dated as of July 26, 2016 (the "Fourth Amendment"), the "Term Credit Agreement"), pursuant to the Fifth Amendment thereto dated as of March 3, 2017 (the "Fifth Amendment"), by and among the Company, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto, KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, as arranger, and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as administrative agent.




	The Fifth Amendment suspends compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants for two additional quarterly calculation periods ending March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the covenant suspension period currently runs through the quarterly calculation period ending December 31, 2016. Any failure by the Company to comply with such financial covenants during the covenant suspension period will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default under the Term Credit Agreement. In addition, under the Fifth Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio will be 5.50 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will decrease to 4.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017, 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio will be 1.60 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will increase to 2.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017, and 2.75 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The Fifth Amendment also provides that, for the four-quarter period ending September 30, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 multiplied by two, and, for the four-quarter periods ending December 31, 2017, Consolidated EBITDA shall be equal to the annualized sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment also permits us to retain the net proceeds of the sale of our tank services business for working capital purposes. In consideration for the Fifth Amendment, we paid an amendment fee of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.




	A copy of the Fifth Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.11 and incorporated into this Item 9B by reference.




	KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC and certain of its affiliates beneficially own 10,125,410 shares of the Company's common stock.

Five Post Oak Park, the company's headquarters


Willbros Group, Inc. is a global engineering and contractor company based in Houston, Texas, United States. It is listed in the New York Stock Exchange. The company operates in the field of energy infrastructure services. Willbros provides engineering, procurement and construction, such as refinery turnarounds, pipeline construction, pipeline integrity management, GIS consulting and other specialty services.
Willbros was founded by William Brothers Company in 1908. It is organized under laws of Panama. It was reorganized as a public company in 1996. Originally, it was headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, in 2000 it moved its administrative headquarters to Houston, Texas.[1] In 2006, Willbros discontinued its operations in Nigeria and Venezuela, although in 2004, Nigeria accounted about 25% of company's global revenue.[1][2] This decision was due to political instability and the militant attacks in Nigeria.[2] Before making this decision, nine Willbros' workers were taken hostage by Nigerian militants.[3]
On February 28, 2005, Willbros Group Inc., said that it was restating financial reports from 2002 on and forecast 2005 earnings far below Wall Street estimates. The adjustments would lower 2002 profit by $900,000, widen the 2003 loss by $2.6 million.[4]
On 14 May 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against Willbros Group and its former managers due to multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Nigeria, Ecuador and Bolivia in 2003–2005.[1] Willbros agreed to pay US$32.3 million in penalties while two of its former managers were sentenced to more than a year in prison.[5][6]
In 2010, Willbros expanded its activities from the oil and gas industry services to the electric transmission and distribution market by the acquisition of InfrastruX Group for about $480 million.[7]
In September 2011, Standard & Poor's lowered Willbros Group's credit ratings to B+ with a negative outlook.[8]
In November 2015, it was announced Michael Fournier was named Chief Executive Officer. Fournier was the Chief Operating Officer before being appointed to this post.[9]

Five Post Oak Park, the company's headquarters


Willbros Group, Inc. is a global engineering and contractor company based in Houston, Texas, United States. It is listed in the New York Stock Exchange. The company operates in the field of energy infrastructure services. Willbros provides engineering, procurement and construction, such as refinery turnarounds, pipeline construction, pipeline integrity management, GIS consulting and other specialty services.
Willbros was founded by William Brothers Company in 1908. It is organized under laws of Panama. It was reorganized as a public company in 1996. Originally, it was headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, in 2000 it moved its administrative headquarters to Houston, Texas.[1] In 2006, Willbros discontinued its operations in Nigeria and Venezuela, although in 2004, Nigeria accounted about 25% of company's global revenue.[1][2] This decision was due to political instability and the militant attacks in Nigeria.[2] Before making this decision, nine Willbros' workers were taken hostage by Nigerian militants.[3]
On February 28, 2005, Willbros Group Inc., said that it was restating financial reports from 2002 on and forecast 2005 earnings far below Wall Street estimates. The adjustments would lower 2002 profit by $900,000, widen the 2003 loss by $2.6 million.[4]
On 14 May 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against Willbros Group and its former managers due to multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Nigeria, Ecuador and Bolivia in 2003–2005.[1] Willbros agreed to pay US$32.3 million in penalties while two of its former managers were sentenced to more than a year in prison.[5][6]
In 2010, Willbros expanded its activities from the oil and gas industry services to the electric transmission and distribution market by the acquisition of InfrastruX Group for about $480 million.[7]
In September 2011, Standard & Poor's lowered Willbros Group's credit ratings to B+ with a negative outlook.[8]
In November 2015, it was announced Michael Fournier was named Chief Executive Officer. Fournier was the Chief Operating Officer before being appointed to this post.[9]

FOR IMMEDIATE
RELEASE

Willbros
Reports First Quarter 2010 Results

 




 



•



 



Fayetteville
Express Pipeline (FEP) project now underway





 



 





 



•



 



Backlog grows
24 percent to $484 million

Guidance
updated to reflect deal cost




HOUSTON, TX,
MAY 10, 2010 —
Willbros Group, Inc. (NYSE: WG) announced results for the first
quarter 2010. For the first quarter of 2010, Willbros reported a
loss from continuing operations of $13.0 million, or $0.33 per
basic and diluted share, on revenue of $137.0 million. First
quarter results were impacted by low levels of large diameter
pipeline construction activity resulting in continued low revenue
and the impact of the previously announced plan to retain key
resources to execute the FEP project which is now underway.
Earnings were also impacted by additional costs associated with
high levels of bidding activity, charges related to the DOJ monitor
and the InfrastruX transaction.

Randy Harl,
President and Chief Executive Officer, explained, “Our first
quarter results were impacted by expected low levels of activity in
both U.S. and Canada pipeline construction and continued margin
pressure in our Downstream segment. While we expected and
communicated a slow start to 2010, we are beginning to see the
expected significant ramp-up in the second quarter as we moved into
the construction phase on FEP and continue executing turnaround
services in our Downstream segment.

“Our
short term focus is on building our backlog, which is up
24 percent over the previous quarter, rationalizing our cost
structure to address a continuing tight refining market and
integrating InfrastruX, after the expected close in the second
quarter. The combination with InfrastruX presents us with multiple
cross selling opportunities to both grow our gas infrastructure
activity and expand our integrated service offering to the electric
transmission and distribution markets. We continue to expect our
contract awards to improve throughout 2010 and we are experiencing
an increase in inquiries in our engineering units in both the
Upstream and Downstream Oil & Gas segments. We believe recent
awards and rising steel and end product prices support our view
that we are at or near the bottom of the cycle for our industry.
Our diversified service offerings and breadth of geographic market
coverage should enable us to grow both our top line and earnings
going forward. Also, a key differentiator for Willbros is our
international experience and our ability to redeploy our resources
to the most attractive global markets, including Australia, where
we have bids outstanding and prospects exceeding
$3 billion.”

Segment
Operating Results

The
Upstream Oil & Gas segment reported an operating loss for the
first quarter of $11.8 million on revenue of
$76.5 million. Operating results were impacted by costs for
resources held to perform the Fayetteville Express Pipeline
project, which is now underway, a high level of bidding activity,
and, in Canada, the delay of a project which was expected to be
performed in the first quarter. Positive performance in the oil
sands region of Canada and services in Oman partially offset the
costs incurred in

pipeline construction. The Downstream Oil & Gas segment
reported an operating loss of $9.0 million on revenue of
$60.5 million. The Downstream segment continues to experience
delays to previously booked maintenance activities and an absence
of capital projects. In the first quarter of 2010, the Government
Services unit has won new assignments and tank services won its
first API storage tank project in Canada.

Backlog
(3)

At
March 31, 2010, Willbros reported backlog from continuing
operations of $484.4 million compared to $391.7 million
at December 31, 2009; approximately 44 percent of backlog
was recurring services contracts

InfrastruX
Acquisition

The
InfrastruX acquisition is anticipated to close in the second
quarter. Willbros management believes the combination with
InfrastruX will accelerate growth objectives and improve visibility
due to a high level of recurring services, increased diversity and
cross-selling opportunities. Randy Harl, President and Chief
Executive Officer, explained, “InfrastruX generates about 70
percent of its revenue from master service agreements
(MSA’s), and these agreements are the product of long and
deep relationships of over 50 years with certain customers. In
addition to the recurring annual revenue generated by MSA’s,
bid work for these same customers also benefits from a high win
rate due to familiarity with their systems and requirements, and
knowledge of execution costs on their systems. We also believe the
opportunity to gain scale and capability for the anticipated
increase in construction of electric transmission projects through
leveraging the Texas Competitive Renewable Energy Zones
(“CREZ” a large electric transmission project)
assignments for Oncor is analogous to our recent experience
developing large diameter pipeline construction capability in the
period prior to 2008 to prepare for the robust build-out of
pipeline infrastructure. This should position us, in combination
with our project management and engineering skill sets, to
competitively address the anticipated $50 billion market for
large electric transmission projects. Additionally,
InfrastruX’s Pittsburgh-based operations position us to
deliver our combined service capability to address the developing
Marcellus Shale and further support our alliance agreement with
NiSource. The pending acquisition of InfrastruX is a result of the
implementation of our strategy which we have been communicating
over the past three years.”

Guidance

Van
Welch, Chief Financial Officer, updated earnings guidance for 2010:
“In our March earnings call, we projected Willbros annualized
revenue between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, with
associated annualized earnings between $0.40 and $0.50 cents per
diluted share which excluded any InfrastruX deal cost. We now
estimate deal cost of $4 million prior to closing and
therefore adjust our guidance on annualized earnings to a range of
$0.35 to $0.45 per diluted share.”

EBITDA is
earnings before net interest, income taxes and depreciation and
amortization and intangible asset impairments. EBITDA as presented
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported
by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA is a useful measure
of evaluating its financial performance because of its focus on the
Company’s results from operations before net interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of
financial performance under generally accepted accounting
principles. However, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of
operating performance used by investors, financial analysts and
rating agencies. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income is
included in the exhibit to this release.

Adjusted EBITDA
is defined as earnings before net interest, income taxes and
depreciation and amortization and intangible asset impairments, as
adjusted for other items that management considers to be
non-recurring, unusual or not indicative of our core operating
performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for comparing
normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods
and with the operational performance of other companies in our
industry and presentations made to our analysts, investment banks
and other members of the financing community who use this
information in order to make investing decisions about us. Most of
the adjustments reflected in Adjusted EBITDA are also included in
performance metrics under our credit facilities and other financing
arrangements. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial
measurement recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Because not all companies use identical calculations,
our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to

Randy
Harl:



 



Thanks, Mike.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.
Yesterday, Willbros reported first quarter 2010 revenue of
$137 million with a loss from continuing operations of $0.33
per share. Van will discuss the results in more detail but I would
like to note that a significant portion of the loss was
attributable to retaining key personnel and equipment in
anticipation of starting the Fayetteville Express Pipeline project
(FEP). Additionally, we incurred costs associated with the pursuit
of growth opportunities, particularly the acquisition of
InfrastruX. While we expected and communicated a slow start to
2010, we are also beginning to see the expected significant ramp-up
in the second quarter as we moved into the construction phase on
FEP and continue executing turnaround services in our Downstream
segment.





 



 





 



 



We
entered 2010 in a strong financial position which enabled us to
advance our strategy of transforming Willbros into a company of
greater scale and diversity with exposure to new end markets and
geographies. Consistent with this strategy, we announced the
acquisition of InfrastruX which we expect to close during the
second quarter of 2010. InfrastruX gains us exposure to the power
end-market where they typically deliver recurring maintenance
and

construction
services through master service agreements (MSAs), which generate
approximately 70% of their revenue. The combination with InfrastruX
also expands our natural gas capabilities closer to the wellhead
and into the Marcellus Shale play through InfrastruX strong
Pittsburgh-based operations. Additionally, we can now translate our
experience delivering recurring maintenance and lifecycle
improvement services necessary to maintain and operate complex
hydrocarbon transportation and processing facilities to the
electric, transmission and distribution market. In addition to the
recurring annual revenue generated by MSAs, we are also well
positioned for bid work for these same customers due to our
familiarity with their systems and requirements and our knowledge
of execution costs on their systems which we have gained from
working closely with them, in certain instances, for more than
50 years.




 




 



 



We
also believe InfrastruX is uniquely positioned to scale its
electric transmission capabilities in advance of an anticipated
significant national build-out by leveraging its CREZ assignments
for Oncor. We see many similarities here to our experience
developing large diameter pipeline construction capability in the
period prior to 2008 to prepare for the robust build-out of
pipeline infrastructure. We believe the addition of our project
management and engineering skills to the InfrastruX service
offering will enhance our ability to capitalize on the anticipated
$50 billion-plus major electric transmission construction
market.





 



 





 



 



The
pending acquisition of InfrastruX also expands our opportunities
and geographic presence in the U.S. pipeline construction market as
our two companies provide different, yet complementary services.
InfrastruX generates about one third of its revenue through
construction of small diameter natural gas pipelines in the
gathering, transmission and distribution markets and has a strong
presence in the Northeast including the Marcellus Shale region.
This small pipe capability, coupled with our engineering and
project management services, enables us to offer full EPC solutions
for virtually all unconventional major gas resources in North
America. Our alliance with NiSource can now benefit from the
addition of InfrastruX construction services in the
Marcellus

Shale region
where NiSource has a strong presence and is teaming with others to
provide natural gas gathering, processing and transmission services
for expected increases in production.




 




 



 



We
expect to highlight the NiSource and Oncor alliance agreements as
models to the industry for the value we can uniquely deliver
through our lifecycle focus capabilities. Our ability to offer our
customers via these relationships will become increasingly
apparent, allowing us to replicate this model across industries and
geographies.





 



 





 



 



A
key competitive differentiator for us in developing these alliances
is our ability to provide early stage engineering services which
traditionally also serve as a leading indicator for our
construction services. We now see positive signs in both our
Upstream and Downstream engineering activities and have begun
selective hiring to meet project demands. These engineering
services, combined with our specialty construction capabilities,
enable us to offer full EPC services and differentiate us from our
competitors.





 



 





 



 



The
excess of large diameter pipeline construction capacity has created
a highly competitive environment for the larger projects in the
United States. As a result, we are expanding our focus on the
expected surge of both shorter distance large-diameter pipeline
projects and small-diameter pipeline projects for interconnects and
laterals. In this market, we continue to maintain strict discipline
in our bidding process and we will not submit a bid nor accept a
project that does not meet our bidding pricing criteria. Despite
robust competition, we believe this market provides many of the
most tangible synergy opportunities with InfrastruX. Additionally,
tight contracting conditions in North America highlight a key
differentiator for Willbros — the experience and capability
gained from 100 years of execution in 60 different countries
to deploy our resources to the most attractive markets worldwide.
We continue to prudently pursue international pipeline construction
and professional services opportunities in North Africa and the
Middle East, while also pursuing EPC opportunities associated with
proposed export pipelines for LNG liquefaction

plants in
Queensland, Australia. We have submitted proposals for multiple
projects and having been short-listed, remain confident that we
will secure new work in Australia.




 




 



 



In
Canada, higher stable oil prices are driving renewed activity in
the oil sands and once stalled projects are restarting. We are
seeing increasing opportunities for our field services,
fabrication, and construction units. Additionally, our strategy to
expand our Downstream services into the Canadian market is gaining
traction, and we have been awarded our first API storage tank
project. We continue to increase our share of the chrome carbide
overlay (CCO) market. We have recently completed and qualified
new automatic straight-run and elbow overlay machinery and
completed the construction of a new 32,000 square foot fabrication
facility bringing our total shop capacity to 75,000 square feet. We
can now address the current and expected future demand for
fabricated pipe spools, API storage tanks, fired heaters, furnaces,
equipment modules and mining equipment, fabrication and repair. The
new machinery and shop capacity will give us the ability to triple
current annual revenues from this business unit. Our Canadian
pipeline assets were idle during the first quarter of 2010 due to
reduced levels of bid activity in 2009. We were hopeful that a
project where we had a Letter of Intent would proceed, but it was
delayed due to permitting issues. We expect this project to move
forward during the winter construction season of 2010 and
‘11. Canadian pipeline bidding activity has improved, and we
are pursuing projects that are scheduled to begin execution later
this summer and into the traditional construction
season.





 



 





 



 



In
Oman, we are encouraged by a return to a market that emphasizes
quality, safety and schedule certainty as opposed to lowest price
as the dominant buying factor. As a result, we are regaining market
share we lost in 2009 and are optimistic that we will see growth in
Oman.





 



 





 



 



In
the Downstream segment, we’re seeing evidence of what may be
the beginning of recovery in this market with increased refinery
utilization, improved refining margins and some new announcements
of renewed capital spending. In our Wink engineering business,

utilization has
improved and, for the first time since the acquisition, we are
adding staff. We are also seeing an increase in project inquiry
levels including EPC projects.





 



 





 



 



We
continue to invest in our Government Services business, and the
task order flow from our NAVFAC contract remains robust. We are
optimistic we will participate in a similar contract vehicle with
the United States Army Corps of Engineers.





 



 





 



 



Van
will now discuss our first quarter financial results.
Van...





 



 





Van
Welch:



 



Thanks, Randy,
and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of this year, we
reported a net loss from continuing operations of $13 million
or $0.33 per share on revenue of $137 million. This compares
to a net loss of $8.3 million or $0.21 per share on revenue of
$193.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. The revenue
decline is primarily attributable to a $31.9 million reduction
in our U.S. construction facilities revenue, a $9.8 million drop in
Canada maintenance and fabrication activities and continuing
weakness in the Downstream segment, particularly with respect to
small capital projects.





 



 





 



 



As
we anticipated, we have performed very little pipeline construction
activity in the past two quarters. Our decision to retain key
assets and people is expected to result in improved performance and
productivity to execute the FEP project which is currently
underway. Our recent safety milestone of achieving 1 million
man-hours without a recordable incident is a testimony to the
quality and dedication of our FEP spread crews, and we believe this
safety performance will correlate strongly with positive project
results. Downstream turnaround activity did increase quarter over
quarter but a delay in one project under contract reduced
utilization of these resources for the quarter below our previous
expectations. Additionally, one construction services project
experienced scope changes which are currently being negotiated. The
$2.8 million in costs associated with these changes are
reflected in first quarter results. As a matter of policy, we do
not recognize change order revenue until it is approved.

Consistent with
our growth strategy, we continue to invest in future business
opportunities, many of which are in developmental stages and are
expected to provide satisfactory returns in the future. In our
Upstream segment, higher international proposal costs, mainly
related to the joint venture opportunities in Australia, have
favorably positioned us to compete for over $3 billion in near
term project awards. Our investment in establishing a presence in
Libya, where changes in government policy have enabled long-delayed
projects to attract capital and resources, is expected to begin
generating initial revenue in the third quarter.





 



 





 



 



In
our Downstream segment, we are successfully expanding our
Government Services offering. Recent awards are increasing the
scale of this business and we expect to be profitable before the
end of the year. Our investment in leveraging our Downstream
capabilities into the oil sands market has resulted in our first
API storage tank award in Canada and we expect our heater services
to benefit from increasing development of steam assisted gravity
drainage (SAG-D) projects. Last July’s Wink acquisition to
date has not been profitable; however, improvement in refinery
utilization and crack spreads, coupled with our increased personnel
utilization and increasing bid activity is encouraging. Going
forward, we are expecting Wink to return to profitable performance
in the second half of the year.





 



 





 



 



We
expect these investments to generate positive returns as global
economic improvements continue, allowing us to appropriately scale
and grow these opportunities.





 



 





 



 



I
will now provide first quarter 2010 financial results by operating
segment.





 



 





 



 



During the
first quarter of 2010, our Upstream segment generated an operating
loss of $11.8 million on revenue on $76.5 million as compared
to a fourth quarter operating loss of $9.9 million on revenue of
$128.5 million. The revenue decline in the first quarter was a
result of lower levels

of
facilities work and the absence of pipeline construction projects
in North America resulting in underutilization of assets and
resources.




 




 



 



With the
mobilization of the FEP project, utilization for our U.S.
construction assets will increase throughout the next two quarters,
which we anticipate will result in greatly improved financial
performance. Again, as Randy stated, we are also optimistic about
the uptick in demand for our Upstream engineering, which we believe
is a precursor to increased construction activity.





 



 





 



 



With respect to
the TransCanada facility project and our unpaid receivable of
$57.9 million, outside counsel has evaluated the contract and
agreed that our contractual position on this cost reimbursable
project is strong. We have taken the appropriate actions to protect
our contractual position but our preference remains to amicably
work with TransCanada, a valuable client, to obtain a mutually
acceptable resolution.





 



 





 



 



Our
Downstream segment generated an operating loss of $9 million
on revenue of $60.5 million compared to the fourth quarter
operating loss of $1.2 million on revenue of
$65.4 million.





 



 





 



 



The
sequential quarter incremental $7.8 million operating loss is
primarily attributable to:

	Not specified as to each class of securities to be registered pursuant to General Instruction II.D of Form S-3. Securities registered hereunder may be sold separately, together or in units with other securities
	registered hereby. Subject to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, in no event will the aggregate initial offering price of the securities issued under this Registration Statement exceed $200,000,000 or if any securities are issued in any foreign
	currencies, composite currencies or currency units, the U.S. dollar equivalent of $200,000,000. Such amount represents the principal amount of any debt securities (or issue price, in the case of debt securities issued at an original issue discount),
	and the issue price of any common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, purchase contracts or rights. This Registration Statement includes such presently indeterminate number of securities registered hereunder as may be issuable from
	time to time upon conversion of, or in exchange for, or upon exercise of, convertible or exchangeable securities as may be offered pursuant to the prospectus filed with this Registration Statement. Separate consideration may or may not be received
	for any securities registered hereunder that are issued upon conversion of, or in exchange for, or upon exercise of, as the case may be, convertible or exchangeable securities.






	(2)


	Each depositary share will be issued under a deposit agreement, will represent an interest in a fractional share or multiple shares of preferred stock and will be evidenced by a depositary receipt.






	(3)


	Any securities registered hereunder may be sold separately or as units with other securities registered hereunder.






	(4)


	Pursuant to Rule 457(p) under the Securities Act, filing fees paid with respect to $300,000,000 of unsold securities of the Registrant are being applied to this Registration Statement from the Registrants
	Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-195845 (the 2014 Registration Statement), filed on May 9, 2014 and declared effective on May 22, 2014. Pursuant to the 2014 Registration Statement, $300,000,000 of
	unsold securities of the Registrant were moved to the 2014 Registration Statement from the Registrants Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-174406 (the 2011 Registration Statement and, together with the
	2014 Registration Statement, the Prior Registration Statements), filed on May 23, 2011 and declared effective on June 3, 2011. The Prior Registration Statements registered securities for a proposed maximum offering price of
	$300,000,000, which securities remain unsold. A filing fee of $34,830 was previously paid by the Registrant with respect to the unsold securities under the Prior Registration Statements. Pursuant to Rule 457(p) under the Securities Act, $23,180 of
	the filing fee previously paid with respect to the Prior Registration Statements is being carried forward to offset the full amount of the filing fee for this offering.




	 



	 




	The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the
	Registrant shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this Registration Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or until this Registration
	Statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.

	You should rely only on the information contained in or specifically incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. We have
	not authorized anyone to provide you with information that is different. This prospectus and any prospectus supplement may only be used where it is legal to sell these securities. The information in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or
	incorporated by reference into this prospectus or any prospectus supplement may only be accurate on the date of those documents.




	Unless the

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), utilizing
	a shelf registration process. Under this shelf process, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. For further information about our business and the
	securities, you should refer to the registration statement and its exhibits. The exhibits to the registration statement and the documents incorporated by reference in the registration statement contain the full text of the contracts and other
	important documents summarized in this prospectus. Since these summaries may not contain all the information that you may find important in deciding whether to purchase the securities that we may offer, you should review the full text of these
	documents. The registration statement can be obtained from the SEC as indicated under the heading Where You Can Find More Information.


	This prospectus provides you with only a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we offer to sell securities, we will
	provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update, or change information contained in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the
	information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with the additional information described
	under the heading Where You Can Find More Information.

	CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING







	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents that we incorporate by reference contain forward-looking
	statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement
	that address activities, events or developments which we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), oil, gas, gas liquids and power prices,
	demand for our services, the amount and nature of future investments by governments, expansion and other development trends of the oil and gas and power industries, business strategy, expansion and growth of our business and operations, the outcome
	of legal proceedings and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and
	expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and
	uncertainties. As a result, actual results could differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	curtailment of capital expenditures due to low prevailing commodity prices or other factors, and the unavailability of project funding in the oil and gas and power industries;

	the demand for energy moderating or diminishing;

	reduced creditworthiness of our customer base and higher risk of non-payment of receivables;




	 




	 


	


	 


	project cost overruns, unforeseen schedule delays and the application of liquidated damages;




	 




	 


	


	 


	inability to execute fixed-price and cost-reimbursable projects within the target cost, thus eroding contract margin and, potentially, contract income on any such project;

	the consequences we may encounter if, in the future, we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the impact of any litigation, including class actions associated with our restatement of first and second quarter 2014 financial results on our financial position and results of operations, including our defense costs

	

	and otherwise award work to contractors in our industry;




	 




	 


	


	 


	failing to realize cost recoveries on claims or change orders from projects completed or in progress within a reasonable period after completion of the relevant project;

	the consequences we may encounter if we violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) or other anti-corruption laws in view of the 2008 final settlements with the Department of Justice and the SEC in
	which we admitted prior FCPA violations, including the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, enhanced monitoring arrangements, or other sanctions that might be imposed;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the dishonesty of employees and/or other representatives or their refusal to abide by applicable laws and our established policies and rules;

	Consequently, all of the forward-looking
	statements made or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be
	realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the consequences for, or effects on, our business or operations that we anticipate today. We assume no obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, whether as a
	result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.








	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO
	FIXED CHARGES



	The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings include income
	(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest (whether expensed or capitalized), amortization of debt expense, discount and premium (whether expensed or capitalized), and an estimate of
	the interest within rental expense. No shares of our preferred stock were outstanding during the periods indicated in the following table. Accordingly, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is the same as the
	ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each such period in the table below.

	DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES




	General



	The following description
	applies to the senior debt securities offered by this prospectus. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the senior debt securities will be direct, unsecured obligations of Willbros and will rank on a parity with all of
	our outstanding unsecured senior indebtedness. The senior debt securities may be issued in one or more series. The senior debt securities will be issued under an indenture between us and the trustee specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	The statements under this caption are brief summaries of the provisions contained in the indenture, do not claim to be complete and are
	qualified in their entirety by reference to the indenture, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Whenever defined terms are used but not defined in this prospectus, those terms
	have the meanings given to them in the indenture.


	The following describes the general terms and provisions of the senior debt securities
	to which any prospectus supplement may relate. The particular terms of any senior debt security and the extent, if any, to which these general provisions may apply to the senior debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating
	to the senior debt securities.


	The indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of senior debt securities which may be issued
	under it. Rather, the indenture provides that senior debt securities of any series may be issued under it up to the aggregate principal amount which we may authorize from time to time. Senior debt securities may be denominated in any currency or
	currency unit we designate. The indenture does not limit or otherwise restrict the amount of other debt which we may incur or the other securities which we may issue.


	Senior debt securities of a series may be issuable in registered form without coupons, which we refer to as registered securities,
	or in the form of one or more global securities in registered form, which we refer to as global securities.


	You must review
	the prospectus supplement for a description of the following terms, where applicable, of each series of senior debt securities for which this prospectus is being delivered:


	 




	 


	


	 




	the title of the senior debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the limit, if any, on the aggregate principal amount or aggregate initial public offering price of the senior debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the priority of payment of the senior debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the price or prices, which may be expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount, at which the senior debt securities will be issued;




	 




	 


	

	If any of the senior debt securities are sold for one or more foreign currencies or foreign currency units or if the principal of or any
	premium or interest on any series of senior debt securities is payable in one or more foreign currencies or foreign currency units, the restrictions, elections, tax consequences, specific terms and other information with respect to that issue of
	senior debt securities and those currencies or currency units will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	A judgment for
	money damages by courts in the United States, including a money judgment based on an obligation expressed in a foreign currency, will ordinarily be rendered only in U.S. dollars. New York statutory law provides that a court shall render a judgment
	or decree in the foreign currency of the underlying obligation and that the judgment or decree shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment or decree.


	Senior debt securities may be issued as original issue discount senior debt securities, to be sold at a substantial discount below their
	stated principal amount due at the stated maturity of the senior debt securities. There may be no periodic payments of interest on original issue discount securities. In the event of an acceleration of the maturity of any original issue discount
	security, the amount payable to the holder of the original issue discount security upon acceleration will be determined in accordance with the prospectus supplement, the terms of the security and the indenture, but will be an amount less than the
	amount payable at the maturity of the principal of the original issue discount security.


	If the senior debt securities are issued with
	original issue discount within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then a holder of those senior debt securities will be required under the


	 


	5






	Table of Contents



	Internal Revenue Code to include original issue discount in ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant interest method that takes into account
	the compounding of interest, in advance of receipt of cash attributable to that income. Generally, the total amount of original issue discount on a senior debt security will be the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity of the security
	over the price at which the security is sold to the public. To the extent a holder of a senior debt security receives a payment (at the time of acceleration of maturity, for example) that represents payment of original issue discount already
	included by the holder in ordinary income or reflected in the holders tax basis in the security, that holder generally will not be required to include the payment in income. The specific terms of any senior debt securities that are issued with
	original issue discount and the application of the original discount rules under the Internal Revenue Code to those securities will be described in a prospectus supplement for those securities.



	Registration and Transfer



	Unless
	otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, senior debt securities will be issued only as registered securities. Senior debt securities issued as registered securities will not have interest coupons.


	Registered securities (other than a global security) may be presented for transfer, with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed,
	or exchanged for other senior debt securities of the same series at the office of the security registrar specified in the indenture. Transfer or exchange will be made without service charge, but we may require payment of any taxes or other
	governmental charges.



	Book-Entry Senior Debt Securities



	Senior debt securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities. Each global security will be
	deposited with, or on behalf of, a depositary identified in the applicable prospectus supplement. Global securities will be issued in registered form and in either temporary or permanent form. Until exchanged in whole or in part for the individual
	securities which it represents, a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary for the global security to a nominee of the depositary or by a nominee of the depositary to the depositary or another nominee of the
	depositary or by the depositary or any nominee to a successor depositary or any nominee of the successor. The specific terms of the depositary arrangement for a series of senior debt securities will be described in the applicable prospectus
	supplement.



	Payment and Paying Agents



	Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on registered
	securities will be made at the office of such paying agent or paying agents as we may designate from time to time. In addition, at our option, payment of any interest may be made by:


	 




	 


	


	 




	check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment at the address in the applicable security register; or




	 




	 


	


	 




	wire transfer to an account maintained by the person entitled to the payment as specified in the applicable security register.




	Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement, payment of any installment of interest on registered securities will be
	made to the person in whose name the senior debt security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for the payment.

	Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets



	The indenture relating to the senior debt securities provides that we may, without the consent of the holders of any of the senior debt
	securities outstanding under the indenture, consolidate with, merge into or transfer our assets substantially as an entirety to any person, provided that:


	 




	 


	


	 




	any successor assumes our obligations on the senior debt securities and under the indenture; and




	 




	 


	


	 




	after giving effect to the consolidation, merger or transfer, no event of default (as defined in the indenture) will have happened and be continuing.




	Any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets substantially as an entirety, which meets the conditions described above, would not create an
	event of default which would entitle holders of the senior debt securities, or the trustee acting on their behalf, to take any of the actions described below under Events of Default, Waivers, Etc.



	Leveraged and Other Transactions



	The
	indenture and the senior debt securities do not contain provisions which would protect holders of the senior debt securities in the event we engaged in a highly leveraged or other transaction which could adversely affect the holders of senior debt
	securities.



	Modification of the Indenture



	The indenture provides that, with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior debt
	securities of each affected series, modifications and alterations of the indenture may be made which affect the rights of the holders of the senior debt securities. However, no modification or alteration may be made without the consent of the holder
	of each senior debt security affected which would, among other things,


	 




	 


	


	 




	modify the terms of payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the senior debt securities; or




	 




	 


	


	 




	reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding senior debt securities required to modify or alter the indenture.





	Events of Default, Waivers, Etc.



	An
	event of default with respect to senior debt securities of any series is defined in the indenture to include:


	 




	 


	(1)


	default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any of the outstanding senior debt securities of that series when due;




	 




	 


	(2)


	default in the payment of interest on any of the outstanding senior debt securities of that series when due and continuance of such default for 30 days;




	 




	 


	(3)


	default in the performance of any of our other covenants in the indenture with respect to the senior debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 60 days after written notice;




	 




	 


	(4)


	certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to us; and




	 




	 


	(5)


	any other event that may be specified in a prospectus supplement with respect to any series of senior debt securities.




	If an event of default with respect to any series of outstanding senior debt securities occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the
	holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or with respect to original issue discount


	 


	7






	Table of Contents



	securities, the portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all senior debt securities of that series to be immediately due and payable. At any time after
	such a declaration of acceleration and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior debt securities of any series may
	rescind and annul the declaration of acceleration and its consequences, but only if all events of default with respect to senior debt securities of such series have been remedied and all payments due, other than those due as a result of
	acceleration, have been made.


	If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee may, in its discretion, and at the written
	request to the trustee of holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior debt securities of any series and upon reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with
	such request and subject to certain other conditions set forth in the indenture will, proceed to protect the rights of the holders of all the senior debt securities of that series. Prior to acceleration of maturity of the outstanding senior debt
	securities of any series, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the senior debt securities may, on behalf of all of the holders of the senior debt securities, waive any past default under the indenture except a
	default in the payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the senior debt securities of that series, a failure by us to convert any senior debt security into shares of our common stock (to the extent such right is applicable) or in
	respect of a covenant or provision of the indenture which, pursuant to the indenture, cannot be waived without the consent of each holder of outstanding senior debt securities.


	The indenture provides that upon the occurrence of an event of default specified in clauses (1) or (2) of the first paragraph in
	this subsection, we will, upon demand of the trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the holders of any senior debt securities, the whole amount then due and payable on the affected senior debt securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest,
	if any. The indenture further provides that if we fail to pay such amount upon demand, the trustee may, among other things, institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of those amounts.


	The indenture also provides that notwithstanding any of its other provisions, the holder of any senior debt security of any series will have
	the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the senior debt securities when due and that such right will not be impaired without the consent of that holder.


	We are required to file annually with the trustee a written statement of our officers as to the existence or non-existence of defaults under
	the indenture or the senior debt securities.



	Satisfaction and Discharge



	The indenture provides, among other things, that when all senior debt securities not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation
	(1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, we may deposit with the trustee funds, in trust, for the purpose and in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
	indebtedness on the senior debt securities not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation. Those funds will include all principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, to the date of the deposit or to the stated maturity, as applicable.
	Upon such deposit, the indenture will cease to be of further effect except as to our obligations to pay all other sums due under the indenture and to provide the officers certificates and opinions of counsel required under the indenture. At
	such time we will be deemed to have satisfied and discharged the indenture.



	Governing Law



	The indenture and the senior debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

	DESCRIPTION OF SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES




	General



	The following description
	applies to the subordinated debt securities offered by this prospectus. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the subordinated debt securities will be unsecured, subordinated obligations of Willbros. The subordinated
	debt securities may be issued in one or more series. The subordinated debt securities will be issued under an indenture between us and the trustee specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	The statements under this caption are brief summaries of the provisions contained in the indenture, do not claim to be complete and are
	qualified in their entirety by reference to the indenture, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Whenever defined terms are used but not defined in this prospectus, those terms
	have the meanings given to them in the indenture.


	The following describes the general terms and provisions of the subordinated debt
	securities to which any prospectus supplement may relate. The particular terms of any subordinated debt security and the extent, if any, to which these general provisions may apply to the subordinated debt securities will be described in the
	prospectus supplement relating to the subordinated debt securities.


	The indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of
	subordinated debt securities which may be issued under it. Rather, the indenture provides that subordinated debt securities of any series may be issued under it up to the aggregate principal amount which we may authorize from time to time.
	Subordinated debt securities may be denominated in any currency or currency unit we designate. The indenture does not limit or otherwise restrict the amount of other debt which we may incur or the other securities which we may issue.


	Subordinated debt securities of a series may be issuable in the form of registered securities or global securities.

	A

	a judgment or decree in the foreign currency of the underlying obligation and that the judgment or decree shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment or decree.


	Subordinated debt securities may be issued as original issue discount securities, to be sold at a substantial discount below their stated
	principal amount due at the stated maturity of the subordinated debt securities. There may be no periodic payments of interest on original issue discount securities. In the event of an acceleration of the maturity of any original issue discount
	security, the amount payable to the holder of the original issue discount security upon acceleration will be determined in accordance with the prospectus supplement, the terms


	 


	10






	Table of Contents



	of the security and the indenture, but will be an amount less than the amount payable at the maturity of the principal of the original issue discount security.


	If the subordinated debt securities are issued with original issue discount within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of
	1986, as amended, then a holder of those subordinated debt securities will be required under the Internal Revenue Code to include original issue discount in ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant
	interest method that takes into account the compounding of interest, in advance of receipt of cash attributable to that income. Generally, the total amount of original issue discount on a subordinated debt security will be the excess of the stated
	redemption price at maturity of the security over the price at which the security is sold to the public. To the extent a holder of a subordinated debt security receives a payment (at the time of acceleration of maturity, for example) that represents
	payment of original issue discount already included by the holder in ordinary income or reflected in the holders tax basis in the security, that holder generally will not be required to include the payment in income. The specific terms of any
	subordinated debt securities that are issued with original issue discount and the application of the original discount rules under the Internal Revenue Code to those securities will be described in a prospectus supplement for those securities.



	Registration and Transfer



	Unless
	otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, subordinated debt securities will be issued only as registered securities. Subordinated debt securities issued as registered securities will not have interest coupons.


	Registered securities (other than a global security) may be presented for transfer, with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed,
	or exchanged for other subordinated debt securities of the same series at the office of the security registrar specified in the indenture. Transfer or exchange will be made without service charge, but we may require payment of any taxes or other
	governmental charges.



	Book-Entry Subordinated Debt Securities



	Subordinated debt securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities. Each global security
	will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a depositary identified in the applicable prospectus supplement. Global securities will be issued in registered form and in either temporary or permanent form. Until exchanged in whole or in part for the
	individual securities which it represents, a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary for the global security to a nominee of the depositary or by a nominee of the depositary to the depositary or another nominee of
	the depositary or by the depositary or any nominee to a successor depositary or any nominee of the successor. The specific terms of the depositary arrangement for a series of subordinated debt securities will be described in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.



	Payment and Paying Agents



	Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on registered
	securities will be made at the office of such paying agent or paying agents as we may designate from time to time. In addition, at our option, payment of any interest may be made by:


	 




	 


	


	 


	check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment at the address in the applicable security register; or

	wire transfer to an account maintained by the person entitled to the payment as specified in the applicable security register.

	Subordination



	The subordinated debt securities will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to some of our other indebtedness (which may include
	senior indebtedness for money borrowed) to the extent described in the applicable prospectus supplement.



	Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets



	The indenture relating to the subordinated debt securities provides that we may, without the consent of the holders of any of the
	subordinated debt securities outstanding under the indenture, consolidate with, merge into or transfer our assets substantially as an entirety to any person, provided that:


	 




	 


	


	 




	any successor assumes our obligations on the subordinated debt securities and under the indenture; and




	 




	 


	


	 




	after giving effect to the consolidation, merger or transfer, no event of default (as defined in the indenture) will have happened and be continuing.




	Any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets substantially as an entirety, which meets the conditions described above, would not create an
	event of default which would entitle holders of the subordinated debt securities, or the trustee acting on their behalf, to take any of the actions described below under Events of Default, Waivers, Etc.



	Leveraged and Other Transactions



	The
	indenture and the subordinated debt securities do not contain provisions which would protect holders of the subordinated debt securities in the event we engaged in a highly leveraged or other transaction which could adversely affect the holders of
	subordinated debt securities.



	Modification of the Indenture



	The indenture provides that, with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt
	securities of each affected series, modifications and alterations of the indenture may be made which affect the rights of the holders of the subordinated debt securities. However, no modification or alteration may be made without the consent of the
	holder of each subordinated debt security affected which would, among other things,


	 




	 


	


	 




	modify the terms of payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the subordinated debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 




	adversely modify the subordination terms of the subordinated debt securities; or




	 




	 


	


	 




	reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding subordinated debt securities required to modify or alter the indenture.





	Events of Default, Waivers, Etc.



	An
	event of default with respect to subordinated debt securities of any series is defined in the indenture to include:


	 




	 


	(1)


	default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of that series when due;




	 




	 


	(2)


	default in the payment of interest on any of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of that series when due and continuance of such default for 30 days;




	 




	 


	(3)


	default in the performance of any of our other covenants in the indenture with respect to the subordinated debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 60 days after written notice;




	 


	12






	Table of Contents





	 


	(4)


	certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to us; and




	 




	 


	(5)


	any other event that may be specified in a prospectus supplement with respect to any series of subordinated debt securities.




	If an event of default with respect to any series of outstanding subordinated debt securities occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or
	the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or with respect to original issue discount securities, the portion of the principal
	amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all subordinated debt securities of that series to be immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration and before a judgment or decree for payment of the
	money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of any series may rescind and annul the declaration of acceleration and its consequences, but only if
	all events of default with respect to subordinated debt securities of such series have been remedied and all payments due, other than those due as a result of acceleration, have been made.


	If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee may, in its discretion, and at the written request to the trustee of holders of
	not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of any series and upon reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and subject to
	certain other conditions set forth in the indenture will, proceed to protect the rights of the holders of all the subordinated debt securities of that series. Prior to acceleration of maturity of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of any
	series, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the subordinated debt securities may, on behalf of all of the holders of the subordinated debt securities, waive any past default under the indenture except a default
	in the payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the subordinated debt securities of that series, a failure by us on request to convert any subordinated debt security into shares of our common stock (to the extent such right is
	applicable) or in respect of a covenant or provision of the indenture which, pursuant to the indenture, cannot be waived without the consent of each holder of outstanding subordinated debt securities.


	The indenture provides that upon the occurrence of an event of default specified in clauses (1) or (2) of the first paragraph in
	this subsection, we will, upon demand of the trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the holders of any subordinated debt securities, the whole amount then due and payable on the affected subordinated debt securities for principal, premium, if any,
	and interest, if any. The indenture further provides that if we fail to pay such amount upon demand, the trustee may, among other things, institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of those amounts.


	The indenture also provides that notwithstanding any of its other provisions, the holder of any subordinated debt security of any series will
	have the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on the subordinated debt securities when due and that such right will not be impaired without the consent of that holder.


	We are required to file annually with the trustee a written statement of our officers as to the existence or non-existence of defaults under
	the indenture or the subordinated debt securities.



	Satisfaction and Discharge



	The indenture provides, among other things, that when all subordinated debt securities not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation
	(1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, we may deposit with the trustee funds, in trust, for the purpose and in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
	indebtedness on the subordinated debt securities not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation. Those funds will include all principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, to the date of the deposit or to the stated maturity, as
	applicable. Upon such deposit, the indenture will cease to be of further effect except as to our obligations to pay all other sums due under the indenture and to provide


	 


	13






	Table of Contents



	the officers certificates and opinions of counsel required under the indenture. At such time we will be deemed to have satisfied and discharged the indenture.



	Governing Law



	The indenture and the
	subordinated debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.



	Regarding the Trustee



	Information concerning the trustee for a series of subordinated debt securities will be set forth in the prospectus supplement relating to that
	series of subordinated debt securities.


	We may have normal banking relationships with the trustee in the ordinary course of business.








	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK




	General



	We have 106,000,000 authorized
	shares of capital stock, consisting of (a) 105,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share; and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.



	Common Stock



	As of April 28, 2017,
	62,782,311 shares of our common stock were outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters
	voted upon by stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of our common stock have no right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Subject to the rights of any then-outstanding shares of our preferred stock, the holders
	of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared in the discretion of the board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We are prohibited from paying cash dividends under the provisions of
	our term loan credit facility.


	The holders of our common stock are entitled to share equally and ratably in our net assets upon a
	liquidation or dissolution after the payment or provision for all liabilities, subject to any preferential liquidation rights of any preferred stock that at the time may be outstanding. The holders of our common stock have no preemptive,
	subscription, conversion or redemption rights, and are not subject to further calls or assessments by us. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock.



	Preferred Stock



	As of the date of this
	prospectus, there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors may, without further approval of the stockholders, issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and fix the dividend rates and terms, conversion
	rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, sinking fund and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of preferred stock.


	The specific matters that the board of directors may determine include the following:


	 




	 


	


	 




	the designation of each series;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the number of shares of each series;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the rate of any dividends;




	 




	 


	


	 




	whether any dividends will be cumulative or non-cumulative;




	 


	14






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 




	the terms of any redemption;




	 




	 


	


	 




	the amount payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company;




	 




	 


	


	 




	rights and terms of any conversion or exchange;




	 




	 


	


	 




	restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or any other series; and




	 




	 


	


	 




	any voting rights.




	The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to determine
	these rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other
	corporate purposes, could:


	 




	 


	


	 




	decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 




	adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of holders of common stock; and




	 




	 


	


	 




	have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.




	For example,
	the board of directors, with its broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized but unissued preferred stock, could issue one or more series of preferred stock entitling holders to vote separately as a class on any proposed merger
	or consolidation, to convert preferred stock into a larger number of shares of common stock or other securities, to demand redemption at a specified price under prescribed circumstances related to a change in control, or to exercise other rights
	designed to impede a takeover.



	Series A Preferred Stock



	In connection with our acquisition of InfrastruX Group, Inc. (InfrastruX) on July 1, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized
	the issuance of a new series of preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) pursuant to a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock could only
	be issued to the former shareholders of InfrastruX under certain circumstances at the time of any final adjustment payment owed by us or if the earnout had been earned under the terms of our agreement to acquire InfrastruX. No shares of Series A
	Preferred Stock have been or will be issued.



	Depositary Shares



	We may issue fractional shares of preferred stock rather than full shares of preferred stock. If we exercise this option, we will issue
	receipts for depositary shares, and each of these depositary shares will represent a fraction (to be set forth in the prospectus supplement relating to such depositary shares) of a share of a particular series of preferred stock.


	The shares of any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement between us and a bank
	or trust company selected by us. The depositary will have its principal office in the United States and a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will be
	entitled, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of preferred stock underlying the depositary share, to all of the rights and preferences of the preferred stock underlying that depositary share. Those rights may include dividend,
	voting, redemption, conversion and liquidation rights.


	The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued under a
	deposit agreement. Depositary receipts will be distributed to those persons purchasing the fractional shares of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares, in accordance with the terms of the offering. We will describe the material terms of
	the deposit

	agreement, the depositary shares and the depositary receipts in a prospectus supplement relating to the depositary shares. You should also refer to the forms of the deposit agreement and
	depositary receipts that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the offering of the specific depositary shares.



	Anti-Takeover Effects of
	Delaware Law and Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws



	Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and
	bylaws contain provisions that might be characterized as anti-takeover provisions. These provisions may deter or render more difficult proposals to acquire control of our company, including proposals a stockholder might consider to be in his or her
	best interest, impede or lengthen a change in membership of the board of directors and make removal of our management more difficult.




	Classified Board of Directors; Removal of Directors; Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations




	Our certificate of incorporation previously provided for the board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors serving
	staggered three-year terms, with the numbers of directors in the three classes to be as nearly equal as possible. On June 1, 2017, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation pursuant to which, beginning with the
	2019 annual meeting of stockholders, the board of directors will cease to be classified and all directors will be elected annually for terms of one year. Prior to our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any director may be removed from office but
	only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter. Following our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any director may be removed from office with or without cause.
	Any stockholder wishing to submit a nomination to the board of directors must follow the advance notice procedures outlined in our bylaws.




	Stockholder Action by Written Consent




	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent.




	Special Meetings of Stockholders




	Our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time only by the board of directors, the chairman of the
	board, the chief executive officer or the president.




	Issuance of Preferred Stock




	As described above, our certificate of incorporation authorizes a class of undesignated preferred stock consisting of 1,000,000 shares.
	Preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, and the board of directors, without further approval of the stockholders, is authorized to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of
	preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to determine these rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock,
	while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and, under certain circumstances, make it more
	difficult for a third party to gain control of us.




	Delaware Business Combination Statute




	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL). In general, Section 203 prohibits a
	business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder within three years of the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:


	 




	 


	


	 




	prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;




	 


	16






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 




	upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the
	time the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are also officers and by certain employee stock plans; or




	 




	 


	


	 




	at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a stockholders meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not
	owned by the interested stockholder.




	Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other
	transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who owns, individually or with or through other persons, 15% or more of the corporations outstanding
	voting stock.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar



	The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Investor Services.

	one or more series, which will be described in the prospectus supplement for the warrants. The following summaries of significant provisions of the warrant agreements and the warrants are not intended to be comprehensive, and holders of warrants

	We and the warrant agent may amend the terms of the warrants and the warrant certificates
	without the consent of the holders to:


	 




	 


	


	 




	cure any ambiguity;




	 




	 


	

	


	 




	amend the terms in any other manner which we may deem necessary or desirable and which will not adversely affect the interests of the affected holders in any material respect.






	Enforceability of Rights of Warrantholders




	The warrant agents will act solely as our agents in connection with the warrant certificates and will not assume any obligation or relationship
	of agency or trust for or with any holders of warrant certificates or beneficial owners of warrants. Any holder of warrant certificates and any beneficial owner of warrants may, without the consent of any other person, enforce by appropriate legal
	action, on its own behalf, its right to exercise the warrants evidenced by the warrant certificates in the manner provided for in that series of warrants or pursuant to the applicable warrant agreement. No holder of any warrant certificate or
	beneficial owner of any warrants will be entitled to any of the rights of a holder of the debt securities or any other warrant property, if any, purchasable upon exercise of the warrants, including, without limitation, the right to receive the
	payments on those debt securities or other warrant property or to enforce any of the covenants or rights in the relevant indenture or any other similar agreement.

	series of warrants, or at any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement relating to that series of warrants, without service charge. However, the holder will be required to pay any
	taxes and other governmental charges as described in the warrant agreement. The transfer or exchange will be effected only if the warrant agent for the series of warrants is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person making the
	request.




	New York Law to Govern




	The warrants and each warrant agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.





	DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS



	We may issue purchase contracts, including contracts obligating holders to purchase from us and us to sell to the holders, a specified
	principal amount of debt securities or a specified number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or any of the other securities that we may sell under this prospectus (or a range of principal amount or number of shares pursuant to a
	predetermined formula) at a future date or dates. The consideration payable upon settlement of the purchase contracts may be fixed at the time the purchase contracts are issued or may be determined by a specific reference to a formula set forth in
	the purchase contracts. The purchase contracts may be issued separately or as part of units consisting of a purchase contract and other securities or obligations issued by us or third parties, including United States treasury securities, securing
	the holders obligations to purchase the relevant securities under the purchase contracts. The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders of the purchase contracts or units or vice versa, and the payments may be
	unsecured or prefunded on some basis. The purchase contracts may require holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contracts in a specified manner and in some circumstances we may deliver newly issued prepaid purchase contracts, often
	referred to as prepaid securities, upon release to a holder of any collateral securing such holders obligations under the original purchase contract.


	The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of any purchase contracts or purchase units and, if applicable, such other
	securities or obligations. The description in the prospectus supplement will not necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the purchase contracts, and, if applicable, collateral arrangements, relating to the
	purchase contracts.





	DESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS



	We may issue rights to purchase common stock, preferred stock, other equity securities described in this prospectus or any combination of such
	securities. These rights may be issued independently or together with any other security offered hereby and may or may not be transferable by the stockholder receiving the rights in such offering. In connection with any offering of such rights, we
	may enter into a standby arrangement with one or more underwriters or other purchasers pursuant to which the underwriters or other purchasers may be required to purchase any securities remaining unsubscribed for after such offering.


	Each series of rights will be issued under a separate rights agreement which we will enter into with a bank or trust company, as rights agent,
	all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. The rights agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the certificates relating to the rights and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust with any holders
	of rights certificates or beneficial owners of rights. We will file the rights agreement and the rights certificates relating to each series of rights with the SEC and incorporate them by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of
	which this prospectus is a part on or before the time we issue a series of rights.

	


	 


	if applicable, the material terms of any standby underwriting or purchase arrangement entered into by us in connection with the offering of such rights; and

	Item 15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



	Willbros is a corporation organized under Delaware law. Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides
	generally that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative in
	nature by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
	venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) and, in a proceeding not by or in the right of the corporation, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him in
	connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason
	to believe his conduct was unlawful. Delaware law further provides that a corporation may not indemnify any person against expenses incurred in connection with an action by or in the right of the corporation if such person shall have been adjudged
	to be liable in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in the view of all
	the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which such court shall deem proper. The bylaws of Willbros provide that the corporation shall indemnify an officer or director against
	liability incurred by such person as authorized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In addition, the directors and officers of Willbros have entered into specific agreements which provide for indemnification of such persons
	by Willbros under certain circumstances.


	Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to provide
	in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any


	 


	II-1






	Table of Contents



	breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
	violation of law, (iii) for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other distributions, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Willbros
	certificate of incorporation provides for limitation of liability for beach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.


	Willbros maintains standard policies of insurance under which coverage is provided to its directors and officers against certain liabilities,
	including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 that might be incurred by them in such capacities.

	Item 17. Undertakings.



	(a) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration
	Statement:


	(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this Registration Statement (or the
	most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of
	securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with
	the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the
	effective Registration Statement; and


	(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution
	not previously disclosed in this Registration Statement or any material change to such information in this Registration Statement;


	provided, however, that paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective
	amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the
	registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment
	shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain
	unsold at the termination of the offering.


	(5) That, for purposes of determining liability under the Securities Act of
	1933 to any purchaser:


	(A) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part
	of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and


	(B) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in
	reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and
	included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule
	430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the
	prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration
	statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective
	date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or

	initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the
	securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such
	securities to such purchaser:


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the
	offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by
	or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;

	other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.


	(b) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	filing of the Registrants Annual Report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
	securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	(c) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to
	supplement the prospectus, after the expiration of the subscription period, to set forth the results of the subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities to be
	purchased by the underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof. If any public offering by the underwriters is to be made on terms differing from those set forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment
	will be filed to set forth the terms of such offering.


	(h) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of
	1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
	indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
	director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
	be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	(j) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the
	purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust
	Indenture Act.

	Exhibit 4.1



	The following Certificate of Incorporation is compiled from the official Certificate of Incorporation and subsequent Amendments.



	CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION




	OF




	WILLBROS GROUP, INC.



	FIRST: The name of the Corporation is Willbros Group, Inc. (the Corporation).


	SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, in the City of
	Dover, County of Kent, Delaware 19904. The name of its registered agent at such address is National Registered Agents, Inc.


	THIRD: The
	purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the GCL).


	FOURTH: (a) The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 106,000,000 shares of capital
	stock, consisting of (i) 105,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share (Common Stock), and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock).


	(b) Each share of Common Stock shall entitle the registered holder thereof to one vote on all matters brought before stockholders of the
	Corporation for a vote.


	(c) The holders of shares of Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.


	(d) The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of the Preferred Stock in one or
	more classes or series, and to fix for each such class or series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications,
	limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series, including, without limitation, the authority to provide that
	any such class or series may be (i) subject to redemption at such time or times and at such price or prices; (ii) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or

	non-cumulative)

	at such
	rates, on such conditions, and at such times, and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or any other series; (iii) entitled to such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any
	distribution of the assets of, the Corporation; or (iv) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock, or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock, of the Corporation at such
	price or prices or at such rates of exchange and with such adjustments; all as may be stated in such resolution or resolutions.





	(e) Upon adoption by the Board of Directors of a resolution or resolutions regarding Preferred
	Stock, a Certificate of Designation of Preferences and Rights of Preferred Stock, setting forth the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights, qualifications and limitations with respect to Preferred Stock, shall be filed in accordance with
	the applicable requirements of the laws of the State of Delaware, and, once filed, such Certificate of Designation shall be incorporated as an integral part of this Article FOURTH and may not be amended or changed without the consent of a majority
	of the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock then outstanding.


	(f) Except as otherwise provided in any resolution or
	resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of any particular series of Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock of any such series so set forth in such resolution or resolutions may be increased (but not above the total
	number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by the Board of Directors. In case the authorized number of shares of
	any such series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased, the shares representing such decrease shall, unless otherwise provided in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance thereof, resume the status of
	authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.


	(g) Except as otherwise provided in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of
	Directors providing for the issuance of any particular series of Preferred Stock, Preferred Stock redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall assume the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock and shall be unclassified as to
	series and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Article FOURTH and to any restrictions contained in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of any such series of Preferred Stock, be reissued in
	the same manner as other authorized but unissued Preferred Stock.


	FIFTH: The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by
	or under the direction of the Board of Directors in accordance with the following:


	(a) The number of directors constituting the entire
	Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3) directors, nor more than twelve (12) directors, the exact number within such limits to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
	entire Board of Directors, provided however, that the number of directors shall not be reduced so as to shorten the term of any director at that time in office.


	(b) Immediately following the effective time of the merger (the Merger) of Willbros Merger, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
	wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, with and into Willbros Group, Inc., a Republic of Panama corporation, and until the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated as
	Class I, Class II and Class III. All classes shall be as nearly equal in number as possible, and no class shall include less than one (1) director. Commencing with the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, directors to replace
	those whose terms expire at each annual meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. The division of directors into classes shall terminate at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. Each
	director shall hold office until the expiration of that directors term and until that directors successor is elected and qualifies or until that directors earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors is changed
	in accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly
	equal in number as possible.


	 


	2





	(c) Any vacancies in the Board of Directors for any reason, and any directorships resulting from
	any increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the Board of Directors, acting by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any director so chosen shall hold office until such directors successor is
	elected and qualifies, and if the Board of Directors at such time is classified, until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen, or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal.


	(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact
	that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation), (i) prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed at any time
	by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on that matter, but only for cause and (ii) from and after the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any director or the entire Board of
	Directors may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on that matter, with or without cause.


	(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall
	have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of
	this Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto (including the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article FOURTH).


	SIXTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
	as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the GCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation
	of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the GCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect
	any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.


	SEVENTH: The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or hereafter
	in effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives; provided,
	however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a
	proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article SEVENTH shall include the right to be
	paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition.


	 


	3





	The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors,
	provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article SEVENTH to directors and officers of the Corporation.


	The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right
	which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Any repeal or modification of this Article
	SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior
	to such repeal or modification.


	EIGHTH: Immediately following the effective time of the Merger, no action required to be taken or which
	may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied. Advance
	notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Elections
	of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.


	NINTH: Meetings of stockholders may be
	held within or without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to
	time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.


	TENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
	upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporations Bylaws. The Corporations Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the
	affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.


	ELEVENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in
	the manner now or hereafter prescribed in this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporations Bylaws or the GCL, and all rights herein conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to such reservation.


	 


	4





	TWELFTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its
	creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor
	or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed
	for the Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such
	manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise
	or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been
	made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

	meeting) to each stockholder of record having voting power with respect to the business to be transacted at such meeting not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Each notice of a special meeting shall state the purpose
	or purposes for which the meeting is being called. Any meeting at which all stockholders having voting power with respect to the business to be transacted thereat are present, either in person or by proxy, shall be a valid meeting for the

	(i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
	corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to
	this Section 2.04(b) shall be deemed given: (A) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address

	new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record having voting power with respect to the business to be transacted at such meeting. When a quorum is present at any
	meeting, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the stock having voting power present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy and entitled to
	vote shall be the act of the stockholders, except where a different vote is expressly required by law, applicable stock exchange rules, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, in which case such express provision shall govern and control.
	A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominees election exceed the votes cast against such nominees election;

	provided, however

	, that directors shall be elected by a plurality
	of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice

	attorney-in-fact


	along with a pass code or other identifier which reasonably establishes the stockholder or the stockholders


	attorney-in-fact

	SECTION 2.08.

	Action by Consent

	. (a) Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the

	registered in the name of each stockholder. The list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (a) during ordinary business hours, at the
	principal place of business of the corporation, or (b) on a reasonably accessible electronic network as permitted by law (provided that the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting). If the

	.


	(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by the
	stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (A) pursuant to the corporations notice of such meeting, (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a
	stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.10, who is entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.10.


	(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to
	Section 2.10(a)(i)(C) above, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a
	stockholders notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the
	first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting;

	provided, however

	, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the
	stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or if the
	first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is
	first made by the corporation. Such stockholders notice (whether provided pursuant to this Section 2.10(a)(ii) or Section 2.10(b)) must set forth: (A) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or

	re-election

	as a director (1) all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), (2) such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected and (3) a statement whether such person, if
	elected, intends to tender, promptly following such persons election or

	re-election,

	an irrevocable resignation effective upon such persons failure to receive the required vote for

	re-election

	at the next meeting at which such person would face

	re-election

	and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Board of
	Directors policies or guidelines on director elections; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for
	conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial

	number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are owned beneficially and held of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (3) the disclosure of any short
	positions or other derivative positions relating to the corporations shares of such stockholder and such beneficial owner, such information to be updated to reflect any material change in such positions through the time of the annual meeting.
	The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that
	could be material to a reasonable stockholders understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.


	(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.10(a)(ii) to the contrary, in the event that the number of
	directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least
	100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, at least 100 days prior to such annual
	meeting), a stockholders notice required by this Section 2.10 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the corporation
	at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.


	(b)

	Special Meetings of Stockholders

	. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
	brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporations notice of such meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
	corporations notice of such meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) 

	provided

	that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
	corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.10. In the event the
	corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as
	specified in the corporations notice of meeting, if the stockholders notice required by Section 2.10(a)(ii) shall be delivered to the Secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier
	than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting is less than 100
	days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

	to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.10. Except as otherwise provided by law,
	the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in

	(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10, a stockholder shall also comply with all
	applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of
	proposals in the corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule

	14a-8

	under the Exchange Act. In order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement for a meeting of

	classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. All classes shall be as nearly equal in number as possible, and no class shall include less than one (1) director. Commencing with the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders,
	directors to replace those whose terms expire at each annual meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. The division of directors into classes shall terminate at the 2019 annual meeting of


	 


	7





	stockholders. Each director shall hold office until the expiration of that directors term and until that directors successor is elected and qualifies or until that directors
	earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors is changed in accordance with the terms of the certificate of incorporation prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the
	classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal in number as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors have the effect of shortening the term of any director at that time in office.


	SECTION 3.03.

	Resignations

	. Any director of the corporation may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic
	transmission to the President or the Secretary of the corporation. Resignations shall become effective upon receipt or at such later time as shall be specified therein and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of a resignation shall
	not be necessary to make it effective.


	SECTION 3.04.

	Vacancies and Newly-Created Directorships

	. Any vacancies in the Board of
	Directors for any reason, and any directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the Board of Directors, acting by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. Any director chosen
	in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until such directors successor is elected and qualifies, and if the Board of Directors at such time is classified, until the next election of the class for which such director shall
	have been chosen, or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal.


	SECTION 3.05.

	Organization

	. At every
	meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if any, or, in the case of a vacancy in the office or absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President or, in his or her absence, a chairman chosen by a majority of the directors
	present, shall preside, and the Secretary or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary or any person appointed by the chairman of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

	. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings, both regular and special, at such place or places within
	or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, or as may be designated in the notice calling the meeting.


	SECTION 3.07.

	Regular Meetings

	. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall
	be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. If the date fixed for any regular meeting be a legal holiday under the laws of the State where such meeting is to be held, then the same shall be held on the next succeeding business day,
	not a Saturday, or at such other time as may be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. At such meetings, the directors shall transact such business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

	SECTION 3.08.

	Special Meetings

	. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held
	whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by two or more of the directors. Notice of the time and place, if any, of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be orally or in writing, by telephone, including a
	voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, facsimile, telegraph or telex, or by electronic mail or other electronic means, during normal business hours, at least 48 hours before the date and
	time of the meeting. If notice is sent by U.S. mail, it shall be sent by first class mail, charges prepaid, at least five (5) days before the date of the meeting. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing, or by electronic transmission, at
	any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat, except when the director attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
	because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A notice or waiver of notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not specify the business to be transacted at or the purpose of the meeting.


	SECTION 3.09.

	Conference Telephone Meetings

	. Any member of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board, or of a

	constitute presence in person at such meeting.


	SECTION 3.10.

	Quorum, Manner of Acting and Adjournment

	. At all meetings of the
	Board a majority of the directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except on additions,
	amendments, repeal or any changes whatsoever in the bylaws or the adoption of new bylaws with respect to any of which the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall be necessary for the adoption of such
	changes and except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
	time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be obtained.


	SECTION 3.11.

	Committees

	. The Board
	of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board, designate an executive committee, an audit committee, a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee and/or one or more other committees, each committee
	to consist of one or more directors of the corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
	disqualification of a member, and the alternate or alternates, if any, designated for such member, of any committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
	constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another director to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. A majority of the members of any committee, as at the time constituted, shall be necessary to constitute a
	quorum thereof, and the act of a majority of the members of any committee who are present at any meeting thereof at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee. Any vacancy in any committee shall be filled by vote of a majority of
	the directors at the time in office.

	exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it, except that no such
	committee shall have the power or authority of the Board of Directors (a) to approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders any action or matter expressly required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to be submitted to the stockholders for
	approval, or (b) to adopt, amend, or repeal any bylaw of the corporation. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee so
	formed shall fix the time and place of its meetings and its own rules of procedure and shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report from time to time to the Board of Directors.


	SECTION 3.12.

	Consent of Directors in Lieu of Meeting

	. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws,
	any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or the committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
	electronic transmission (including electronic mail), and such writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions (including electronic mail) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or the committee.

	Presumption of Assent

	as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or unless such director shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall not
	apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

	for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and/or a stated retainer as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or
	standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.


	SECTION 3.15.

	Removal of Directors

	. Prior
	to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any director may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock entitled to generally vote at any election of

	certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
	owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or such owners legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with

	. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
	threatened to be made a party to any third party proceeding (which shall include, for purposes of this Article VI, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
	investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
	employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including without limitation attorneys fees,


	 


	15





	judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
	with such third party proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had no
	reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
	the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or, with respect to any criminal third party proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
	such conduct was unlawful.


	SECTION 6.02.

	Indemnification in Corporate Proceedings

	. The corporation shall indemnify any person who
	was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any corporate proceeding (which shall mean, for purposes of this Article VI, any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to
	procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including without limitation attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of a corporate proceeding if the
	person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
	person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the corporate proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of
	all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.


	SECTION 6.03.

	Mandatory Indemnification

	. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been
	successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any third party or corporate proceeding referred to in Section 6.01 or 6.02 above or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses,
	including without limitation attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.


	SECTION 6.04.

	Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification

	. Any indemnification under Section 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03 of this Article VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a
	determination that indemnification of a present or former director or officer of the corporation is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03 of this
	Article VI. This determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of the determination:


	 




	 


	(a)


	By a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to the third party or corporate proceeding, even though less than a quorum;




	 


	16







	 


	(b)


	By a committee of directors designated by a majority vote of directors, even though less than a quorum;




	 




	 


	(c)


	If there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or




	 




	 


	(d)


	By the stockholders.




	SECTION 6.05.

	Burden of Proof

	shall, in any subsequent legal proceedings relating to such denial, have the burden of proving that indemnification was not required under Section 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03 of this Article VI, without regard to Section 6.04 hereof, or under
	any other agreement or undertaking between the corporation and such person, or was not permitted under applicable law.


	SECTION 6.06.

	Advancing Expenses

	. Expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer or former director or officer in defending a third party or corporate proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance
	of the final disposition of such third party or corporate proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer or former director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person
	is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon the terms and conditions, if any,
	as the corporation deems appropriate.

	officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
	of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.


	SECTION 6.08.

	Employees and Agents

	. The corporation may, but is not required to, indemnify any employee or agent of the corporation who
	is not also a director or officer of the corporation if the determining group as specified in Section 6.04 determines that indemnification is proper in the specific case.


	SECTION 6.09.

	Scope of Article

	. The indemnification and advancement of expenses, as authorized by this Article VI, shall not be
	deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
	official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding an office.

	or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such
	person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.


	SECTION 6.12.

	Re:



	Willbros Group, Inc. Registration Statement on Form

	S-3






	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as counsel to Willbros Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the
	filing by the Company of a registration statement on Form

	S-3

	(the Registration Statement), with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	Securities Act), for the registration of the sale from time to time of up to $200,000,000 aggregate offering price of (i) debt securities of the Company, which may be either senior debt securities (the Senior Debt
	Securities) or subordinated debt securities (the Subordinated Debt Securities and together with the Senior Debt Securities, the Debt Securities), (ii) shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.05 per share
	(the Common Stock), (iii) shares of the Companys preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock), (iv) depositary shares representing fractional interests in the Preferred Stock (the Depositary
	Shares), (v) warrants representing rights to purchase Debt Securities, Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company (Warrants), (vi) purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of debt or equity securities of the Company or any
	combination thereof (Purchase Contracts), (vii) rights to purchase Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other equity securities described in the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement (the Prospectus) (the
	Rights), and (viii) units consisting of one or more Rights, Purchase Contracts, Warrants, Debt Securities, shares of Common Stock, shares of Preferred Stock or any combination of such securities (Units and together with
	the Debt Securities, Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, Warrants, Purchase Contracts and Rights, the Securities). The Securities will be sold or delivered from time to time as set forth in the Registration Statement, the
	Prospectus and supplements to the Prospectus (the Prospectus Supplements).


	In connection with this opinion, we have examined
	originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the form of Indenture relating to the Senior Debt
	Securities (the Senior Indenture) filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and (iv) the form of Indenture relating to the Subordinated Debt Securities (the Subordinated Indenture) filed as an exhibit to the
	Registration Statement. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other
	representatives of the Company, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.

	other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate, limited liability company, partnership or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such
	documents, and, as to parties other than the Company, the validity and binding effect on such parties. We have also assumed that the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
	organization and that the Company has complied with all aspects of applicable laws of jurisdictions other than the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the State of New York in connection with the
	transactions contemplated by the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement (hereinafter defined), the Deposit Agreement (hereinafter defined), the Warrant Agreement (hereinafter defined), the Rights Agreement
	(hereinafter defined) and the Registration Statement. We have also assumed that the choice of New York law to govern the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Deposit Agreement, the Warrant Agreement and
	the Rights Agreement is a valid and legal provision.


	Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the limitations, qualifications,
	exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:


	1. The Senior Debt Securities proposed to be sold by the Company,
	when (i) duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action by the Company, (ii) the Senior Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (iii) the Senior Indenture and any supplemental
	indenture in respect of the Senior Debt Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, (iv) the terms of the Senior Debt Securities have been duly established in accordance with the Senior Indenture and any applicable
	supplemental indenture relating to the Senior Debt Securities, and (v) the Senior Debt Securities have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the Senior Indenture and any related supplemental indenture in respect of the Senior
	Debt Securities and duly issued and delivered by the Company upon payment of the consideration therefor in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and any Prospectus Supplement relating thereto, will constitute valid and binding
	obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms.


	2. The Subordinated Debt Securities proposed to be sold by the
	Company, when (i) duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action by the Company, (ii) the Subordinated Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (iii) the Subordinated Indenture
	and any supplemental indenture in respect of the Subordinated Debt Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, (iv) the terms of the Subordinated Debt Securities have been duly established in accordance with the
	Subordinated Indenture and any applicable supplemental indenture relating to the Subordinated Debt Securities, and (v) the Subordinated Debt Securities have been duly executed and authenticated

	(b) we have assumed that the execution and delivery by the Company of the Senior Indenture,
	the Subordinated Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Deposit Agreement, the Warrant Agreement and the Rights Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder do not and will not violate, conflict with or
	constitute a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its properties is subject; and


	(c) we have assumed,
	with respect to the opinions set forth above, that there will be a sufficient number of unissued shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock authorized under the Companys organizational documents and not otherwise reserved for issuance to cover
	the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and delivered in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and any Prospectus Supplement relating thereto or upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any other Security
	in accordance with the terms of such Security or the instrument governing such Security providing for such conversion, exchange or exercise.


	Furthermore, the opinions set forth above are subject to the effects of generally applicable laws that (a) provide for the enforcement of
	oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (b) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another
	remedy has been elected, (c) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction
	involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct, (d) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the
	unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (e) may limit the enforceability of provisions providing for compounded interest, imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or
	default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration and (f) limit the waiver rights under usury laws.


	Our opinions set
	forth above are limited to the laws of the State of New York which are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals,
	licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including the applicable provisions
	of the Delaware Constitution and judicial decisions interpreting those laws as of the date of this opinion (all of the foregoing being referred to as Opined on Law). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any other
	jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non opined law on the opinions herein stated.
