Gather and organize the following documents: One month of current pay stubs, W-2 forms from the last 2 years and bank and retirement statements from the past 2 months.
Know your gross monthly income. Be sure to tell your lender if you are self-employed, paid by commission, receive bonuses or tips. Also be sure to also let your lender know if you pay or receive any child support, alimony or separation maintenance.
Credit card balances above 50% of your limit or falling behind on other loan payments could lower your credit score. Keep tabs on your spending habits before applying for a mortgage.
Limit the amount of people that you allow to pull your credit; too many inquiries can negatively impact your score.

Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. and The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company Announce Agreement to Merge


		Posted on Mar 29th, 2017


Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. (“Mid Penn”) (NASDAQ: MPB), headquartered in Millersburg, Pennsylvania, and The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company (“Scottdale”) (OTC: SDLJ), headquartered in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, today jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement which calls for Mid Penn to purchase the stock of Scottdale in a transaction valued at approximately $59.1 million. The merger will expand Mid Penn’s footprint into western Pennsylvania including Westmoreland and Fayette counties. Mid Penn projects that it will have over $1.3 billion in assets upon completion of the merger.
Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Scottdale common stock will receive approximately $59.1 million in consideration, or $1,166 per share for each share of Scottdale common stock, subject to an aggregate proration of no less than 90% common stock in Mid Penn and no more than 10% cash. The per share acquisition price equals approximately 130 percent of Scottdale’s December 31, 2016, tangible book value per share. Mid Penn expects the transaction will be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share and will materially increase their capital ratios.
“I am very pleased to announce our merger with The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company,” said Mid Penn President and CEO Rory G. Ritrievi. “Scottdale’s commitment to both community service and community banking aligns well with Mid Penn’s culture and brand. Through this combination, we will be able to offer new products, services and conveniences to Scottdale’s customers while also continuing and enhancing the bank’s good work in the communities it serves. Mid Penn has built a full-service community bank which is now poised to serve both central and western Pennsylvania.”
“The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company has remained committed to its roots as a hometown community bank that provides the best service possible to our customers,” said Scottdale President and CEO Donald F. Kiefer. “Our continued commitment to the community over the years has been made possible by our dedicated team and customers. We are confident that this commitment will be even stronger with Mid Penn as a great partner that shares the same values and personal customer service delivery.”
Mid Penn has proposed that Mr. Kiefer will be added to Mid Penn’s Board of Directors upon completion of the merger.
Subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory and shareholder approvals, the merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017. Following completion of the merger, Scottdale will be merged into Mid Penn Bank and will operate as “Scottdale Bank & Trust, a division of Mid Penn Bank.”
Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. acted as financial advisor and Stevens & Lee acted as legal advisor to Mid Penn in the transaction. Ambassador Financial Group, Inc. acted as financial advisor and Tucker Arensberg, P.C. acted as legal advisor to Scottdale.

Mid Penn expects to open the branch in the first quarter of 2018 once construction is complete. “We are pleased to be returning to the Halifax community with a full service retail location that will provide the area with the community banking expertise they deserve,” said Mid Penn Bank President and CEO Rory G. Ritrievi. “We’ve waited for the right time to open a branch in Halifax and that time has arrived. Halifax Township has done a tremendous job of spurring local business growth, and we look forward to working with them on establishing our new facility in the community.”  It is anticipated that the Halifax location will employ three to five team members to fulfill personal banking, business banking and lending needs. In addition to traditional branch banking, Mid Penn also offers online banking, mobile banking and telephone banking to provide customers with on-the-go, instant account access. About Mid Penn Bancorp Inc. Mid Penn Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:MPB), through its banking subsidiary, Mid Penn Bank, has been serving Central Pennsylvania since 1868. Headquartered in Millersburg, Pennsylvania, Mid Penn Bank has 23 retail locations in Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Luzerne, Northumberland and Schuylkill counties.

Phoenix shareholders are anticipated to own approximately 17% of the combined company.  Following completion of the merger, Mid Penn expects to remain well-capitalized, and the company expects the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share.

“We are pleased to share this exciting news which serves as a milestone for both institutions,” said Mid Penn President and CEO, Rory G. Ritrievi. “This merger enables Mid Penn and Phoenix’s subsidiary, Miners Bank, to work together to bring the best in banking products and services to the communities in which we operate. By sharing resources and expanding our footprint, we will become stronger and better positioned for continued growth.”

“Joining Mid Penn is the best choice for our shareholders, customers, employees and communities,” said Phoenix President and CEO, George H. Groves. “Merging with Mid Penn will present more opportunities while still allowing us to provide the local and personal service our customers have come to expect. We will be able to leverage the strengths of both banks in order to achieve further growth in our current markets and beyond.”

Mid Penn has proposed that Phoenix’s Board Chairman Vincent J. Land and Board Members Noble C. Quandel, Jr., and Robert Moisey be added to the Board of Mid Penn and Mid Penn Bank upon completion of the merger.

Phoenix Chairman Vincent J. Land commented, “While we are pleased to join forces with a well performing community banking organization like Mid Penn, we are also excited to have the Miners Bank name live on. That name has been serving the good people of Schuylkill and now Luzerne Counties since 1935 and will continue to do so long into the future.”

Subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory and shareholder approvals, the merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. Following completion of the merger of Mid Penn and Phoenix, Phoenix’s subsidiary bank, Miners Bank, will be merged into Mid Penn Bank and will operate as “Miners Bank, a Division of Mid Penn Bank.”
