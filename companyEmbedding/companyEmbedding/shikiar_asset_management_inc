MANAGING INCOME REQUIRES A THOUGHTFUL BALANCE OF RISK AND RETURN
 
 


 














Services

For high net worth / family office clients, we assist in addressing diverse wealth management challenges, including successful retirement planning, generational wealth transformation, family-specific solutions, advanced planning and relationship management.



Strategies

We model our clients' portfolios based on individual criteria: tolerance for risk, investment time horizon, specific asset class preference and other financial goals / measures. In addition, we manage Shikiar Strategic Income and Shikiar Large Cap Core Equity, two focused investment strategies. All portfolios are offered exclusively as separate accounts, thus allowing for customization or personalization as necessary. 
Shikiar Strategic Income 
Shikiar Strategic Income is designed for low-correlated income-generating investments seeking strong risk-adjusted performance. We seek long-term capital appreciation and yield through investments in dividend-paying stocks, high-yield bonds, preferred equities, as well non-traditional equity securities such as MLPs, REITs and BDCs. Investments are opportunistically and strategically invested across the corporate capital structure. Equity securities, both traditional and non-traditional, are invested with the aim of providing capital growth, while fixed income-related securities are invested with the aim of limiting overall volatility, as well as providing additional sources of income generation. We apply thoughtful parameters around allocations to given asset classes, thus allowing the firm the flexibility to take advantage of ever-changing markets and various dislocations that may occur. To learn more about Shikiar Strategic Income, please contact us here.
Shikiar Large Cap Core Equity
Through Shikiar’s Large Cap Core Equity strategy, we approach our investments as owners of businesses, not merely as investors. We invest in well-managed and capitalized companies with sustainable free cash flow generation, attractive dividend yields, meaningful market share, attractive operating margins and other fundamentals. Through active market research and analysis we affirmatively overweight / underweight sectors and industries as appropriate and have zero exposure to industries we find unattractive. To learn more about Shikiar Large Cap Core Equity, please contact us here.

						CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research

Tweet










CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%. The firm’s revenue was up .3% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the company posted $0.60 EPS.

Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
