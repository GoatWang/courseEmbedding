Video Display Corp. to Acquire Evans & Sutherland's ESCP and TargetView Projector Product Lines | Business Wire
























































Video Display Corp. to Acquire Evans & Sutherland's ESCP and TargetView Projector Product Lines






August 26, 2004 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



				SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 26, 2004--Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp. (NASDAQ: ESCC) (E&S(R)) and Video Display Corp. (NASDAQ: VIDE) (VDC) announced today that the companies have reached an agreement in principle for E&S to sell its ESCP(R) and TargetView(R) CRT projector product lines to VDC. Under the terms of the agreement, which is expected to be finalized no later than Sept. 24, 2004, VDC will purchase all product assets from E&S for these CRT product families. E&S will continue to manufacture CRT products currently on order through the end of Q3 of this year, with VDC taking over the manufacturing Oct. 1, 2004. A complete transition to VDC facilities is anticipated to be complete by the end of 2004.  After the sale is completed, E&S will continue to offer the VDC/E&S CRT projection products to customers wishing to purchase E&S visual systems. In addition, E&S will continue to support service contracts that call for maintenance, repair and spares for these products.

E&S will continue to provide products and services for existing and new customers who desire CRT-based projector systems, while shifting all its engineering efforts to the recently announced ESLP(TM) laser projector," said E&S CEO James Oyler. "In addition, this sale will allow VDC to expand sales of these excellent products beyond those being bundled with E&S Systems."  Ron Ordway, CEO of Video Display Corp., stated, "The unique synergy that can be demonstrated within this new working relationship with E&S is unquestionably the ultimate goal sought in every combination. We at VDC truly welcome this opportunity to work with E&S and their outstanding worldwide customer base."  About Video Display Corp.

Video Display Corporation










The Video Display Corporation group of companies is dedicated to the production of Data Display products at the highest level of quality and excellence.
For Video Display Corporation, The past 12 months has represented a year of substantial challenges and important accomplishments toward achieving our long term goal of becoming the premier player in the field of specialty displays.
The accomplishments were both numerous and exciting.  As the Company continued its transition through dedication of efforts and resourses into Specialty CRTs and Displays, we have sold our Vanco distribution facility and redeployed the proceeds into display related acquisitions.  These purchases included the assets of Ampro Corp., Melbourne, Florida; Lexel Imaging Systems, Lexington, Kentucky; and the Electro Optical Display division of Imaging and Sensing Technology, Horsehead, New York as well as Raytheon Displays Systems in Quincy Mass.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
