History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007.

NYSE:STT 






State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), this week celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of launching Australia’s first exchange traded funds (ETFs) on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”).On 27 August 2001, State Street Global Advisors launched Australia’s first ETFs —  the SPDR® S&P®/ASX 200 Fund (STW) and the SPDR® S&P®/ASX 50 Fund (SFY), two flagship equity funds used by retail and institutional investors alike in accessing the country’s large cap shares. James MacNevin, chief operating officer of SSGA in Asia Pacific led the local launch, and today credits the rapid adoption of ETFs in Australia to their ease of use, instant diversification benefits and cost efficiency. Additionally, he stresses the importance of a continued focus on education to retail investors on understanding investment risks and the inherent benefits ETFs provide.“When we launched the first ETFs in Australia there was little awareness of these funds’ benefits. Based on our global experience, we realised the need to provide Australian financial advisers with better information to help them explain the benefits of ETFs to investors. Today, the ETF investor base has grown from institutional investors and financial advisers to individual investors. Retail investors are now realising that ETFs are an easy-to-use, transparent investment tool that gives them diversified exposure to some of the largest companies in the world through a single trade,” said MacNevin.The ASX also recognises the importance of investor awareness as underpinning continued market growth.“ASX is proud to have partnered with State Street Global Advisors in establishing the ETF market in Australia. Since the 2001 launch, the market has now grown to more than AU$23 billion; due in large part to the strong education initiatives of SSGA and other ASX exchange traded product issuers, which have increased the awareness of retail investors. With 14 exchange traded product issuers and 139 products available, investors and advisers alike have greater access to new market segments and asset classes than ever before. They also have a better understanding of how to use ETFs and other exchange traded products in their portfolios” said Max Cunningham, General Manager Listings and Issuer Services at the Australian Securities Exchange.SSGA expects future growth to be driven by continued product innovation, diversification and increased awareness among investors.“Overall, investors’ portfolios have evolved and advanced since the introduction of the first ETF and investors continue to seek greater insight into how ETFs can be applied to achieve their specific investment goals in challenging markets. Given SSGA’s heritage as the founder of ETFs, both globally and in Australia, we are well positioned to help investors maximise performance,” said MacNevin.State Street Global Advisors is one of the world’s largest ETF providers, has 16 SPDR ETFs in Australia including Australia’s largest ETF the SPDR® S&P®/ASX 200 Fund[1]. SSGA’s ETF assets under management in Australia totaled AU$4.83 billion as at 31 July 2016.About State Street Global AdvisorsFor nearly four decades, State Street Global Advisors has been committed to helping our clients, and those who rely on them, achieve financial security.We partner with many of the world’s largest, most sophisticated investors and financial intermediaries to help them reach their goals through a rigorous, research-driven investment process spanning both indexing and active disciplines.

Online Job Scam Warning
State Street and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) do not conduct job interviews via non-State Street email, instant messaging or chat rooms. Legitimate recruitment emails will contain the extension “@statestreet.com or @ssga.com.” If you have been contacted via social media channels to participate in an online interview using email, instant messaging or chat rooms for a position at State Street or SSGA, it is not legitimate.
These scams usually have one of more of the following characteristics:

They attempt first contact via email from a public domain or via a text message.
They attempt to perform an online interview via common web services.
They may impersonate State Street or SSGA individuals during the process.
They may send a check and ask for the funds to be deposited and wired to another location for the purchase of home office equipment.
They may use the State Street or SSGA trademark and logo in the process.

If you have been contacted under these circumstances please report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which is a partnership among the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BIA), at www.ic3.gov.

About SPDR ETFs


About SPDR ETFs
What are ETFs?




About SPDR® ETFs
ETFs provide investors with the flexibility to select investments that are precisely aligned to their investment strategy. As an industry pioneer, State Street Global Advisors created the first US listed ETF in 1993. Since then, each new member of the SPDR ETF family has been built to reflect our intimate knowledge of the ETF market.
We believe ETFs are about finding simple solutions to help meet investors' needs. Our ETFs seek to provide a transparent way to access specific market segments.

About State Street Global Advisors
For nearly four decades, State Street Global Advisors has been committed to helping financial professionals and those who rely on them achieve their investment objectives. We partner with many of the world's largest, most sophisticated investors and financial intermediaries to help investors reach their goals through a rigorous, research-driven investment process spanning both indexing and active disciplines. With trillions* in assets under management, our scale and global reach offer clients access to markets, geographies and asset classes, and allow us to deliver thoughtful insights and innovative solutions.
State Street Global Advisors is the investment management arm of State Street Corporation.


*Assets under management were $2.56 trillion as of March 31, 2017. AUM reflects approx. $3.33 billion (as March 31, 2017) with respect to which State Street Global Advisors Fund Distributors ("SSGA FD"; U.S. Fund Distributor) serves as marketing agent; SSGA FD and State Street Global Advisors are affiliated.



What are ETFs?
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are transparent, predominantly passive products that trade on an exchange. They can be a useful portfolio diversification tool and allow both large and small investors alike to gain exposures to broad or niche segments of the market and at a relatively low cost.
An ETF is comprised of a collection, or 'basket', of securities that seek to track the performance of a broad or a specific segment of the market. ETFs combine the features of index mutual funds with individual securities.

Like a fund
Like index mutual funds, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to hundreds of domestic and international indexes. And like most indexed mutual funds, they can offer:

Transparency
Relatively lower expenses 1
Diversification, through holding a basket of securities
Tax efficiency 2



Like a stock
Like individual stocks, ETFs:

Can offer intraday trading capabilities 3
Are available in multiple currencies
Are able to be listed across multiple exchanges



1. Frequent trading of an ETF can significantly increase commissions and other costs such that they may offset any savings from low fees or costs.
2. Passive management and the creation/redemption process can help minimize capital gains distributions.
3. There can be no assurance a liquid market will be maintained for ETF shares.

HomeArticlesIndexFunds.com StaffState Street to Launch New Australian ETFs













The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), the investment management arm of Boston-based State Street Corporation, today announced that they have signed an agreement to develop the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to Australian investors.
The move signals State Street's intention to enter the international ETF fray. Earlier this year, the first foreign-based ETFs hit Europe, with Merrill Lynch co-managing the first two ETFs in Germany. Barclays Global Investors launched the first ETF available to UK investors. In addition, Barclays has also launched a parade of country-specific ETFs that track markets abroad and are available on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).
The State Street announcement indicates that it does not want to be left out of the game as companies scramble to launch ETFs in Europe and Asia.
Under the terms of the State Street/ASX agreement, the first Australian ETF will become available by April 2001. Although the two parties have yet to decide upon a benchmark index, the agreement allows for the development of ETFs over the Standard & Poor's (S&P)/Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) 20, the S&P/ASX 50, the S&P/ASX 100, the S&P/ASX 200, the S&P/ASX 300, and the All Ordinaries Index.
Although he could not comment on the specifics of the agreement, Gus Fleites, Director of ETFs at State Street, said, "To the best of our knowledge, no other players have been licensed to launch such products based on the new suite of S&P/ASX indices. We expect that the eventual products will reflect the same advantages ETFs offer investors across the globe: diversified portfolio, listed and traded on an exchange, and competitive expense ratios."
State Street and ASX expect the initial demand for the new ETFs will be from institutional investors, but that retail investors will be attracted to them as a low-cost means of gaining exposure to equities.
This latest announcement highlights the fact that there is truly a global demand to invest in ETFs.
"Providing ETFs forms part of ASX's program to meet the growing demands of Australian investors by broadening the range of products and services we offer," said ASX Managing Director and CEO, Richard Humphry.
"The passive investment approach helps to keep costs down through relatively low turnover and the ability to trade continuously makes them a very flexible instrument," said Mark Lazberger, Managing Director of SSgA Australia.
Fleites said that State Street has "several projects underway outside the U.S. for new ETF launches," but was not at liberty to comment on specifics at the time.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]
