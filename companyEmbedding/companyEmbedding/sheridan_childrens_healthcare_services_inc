                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

Grateful Patients, Families Help Emergency Physicians Cope with Burnout

The physician burnout epidemic in the United States continues to worsen. Alarmingly, according to the new Medscape Lifestyle Report 2017: Race and Ethnicity, Bias and Burnout, Emergency medicine now has a burnout rate of nearly 60 percent—the highest of any medical specialty.
Most physicians enter the medical profession because the work is meaningful and gives them a sense of purpose. According to a recent article in NEJM Catalyst, “burnout becomes epidemic” when physicians’ frustration with the current healthcare system’s “demands, limitations, and inconsistencies” impede their efforts to deliver excellent care. 
A survey discussed in a recent...

Anesthesia Business Group Executive Management Program

One of the ways in which Envision Physician Services invests in its physicians’ and physician leaders’ professional development is to send selected anesthesia providers and practice managers to the Anesthesia Business Group (ABG) Executive Management Program. This exclusive, four-day, on-campus, residential program is offered during the first quarter of each year by ABG in partnership with the Wharton School of Business. It has been Wharton Executive Education’s most highly rated program for five years in a row. The 2017 session took place February 12–16.

Doctors Recommend a Pause Before Cutting the Umbilical Cord

In the first moments of a newborn’s life, obstetricians make multiple crucial decisions to provide optimal medical care. One of those decisions is the right time to cut the umbilical cord. While it has traditionally been cut immediately after birth to quickly clean and deliver the newborn to its expecting parents, the health care community has started to rethink this age-old practice. The latest official change in thinking has come from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which recently recommended that obstetricians wait at least 30 to 60 seconds before cutting the umbilical cord, as reported by The New York Times.
Even before the ACOG released the new recommendations, many...

Google’s AI Could Help Pathologists Identify Breast Cancer Better, Faster

According to the CDC, there are more than 230,000 people diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. each year.  For these patients, determination of whether cancer cells have metastasized to other parts of the body significantly influences decisions about treatment.
While a pathologist’s report is generally considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of cancer, reviewing diagnostic slides is an extremely complicated task, even for specialists with years of training and experience. Different pathologists can arrive at variable diagnoses for the same patient, which can result in misdiagnoses. Diagnostic agreement for some forms of breast cancer can be as low as 48%. That number is unsurprising, considering the...

Pediatric Vaccine Recommendations Updated for 2017


In a recent joint report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have released the recommended childhood and adolescent immunization schedules for 2017. While immunization schedules are typically updated annually, medical professionals view some of the recent schedule updates as significant changes for pediatricians. Influenced by new trends in nationwide adolescent health, notable changes to the recommendations include:
1. Adolescents should no longer be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Flu-related hospitalizations and deaths have spiked nationwide since the start of the 2016–2017 flu season. Children younger...

This year, we also want to bring special attention and thanks to the many doctors and other clinicians who, in addition to their day-to-day contributions in their practices, generously volunteer their skills and time and open their hearts and wallets to help those in need.

Northside Team Saves Mother, Baby in Complicated Delivery

Air Force major Jerry Gay and his pregnant wife, Mary, were looking forward to the expected February 9 arrival of their new daughter. Mary was at home in Georgia and Jerry was deployed in Qatar, in the Middle East. But the couple’s joy became tempered with fear when Mary’s ob-gyn, Dr. Alex Eaccarino, noticed a spot that didn’t look quite normal during Mary’s 30-week checkup, per a recent story on Fox 5 Atlanta. 
The spot turned out to be uterine scarring from Mary’s prior cesarean-section deliveries. The scarring increased her risk for a placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening obstetric condition that occurs when part or all of the placenta invades the uterine wall and is...

The Role of Professional Development in Physician Engagement

Sheridan’s Chief Quality Officer Gerald Maccioli, MD, MBA, FCCM sees physician engagement as essential for all stakeholders. He spoke with Becker’s ASC Review recently about the value of investing in comprehensive professional development opportunities for physicians to keep them engaged. 

“We all want the quadruple aim—which includes a satisfied population of physicians,” he said in the Q & A. “If engagement isn't developed, you are never going to get to that. It will always be a push and pull rather than a rolling together phenomenon.”
Dr. Maccioli explained that physicians are highly educated problem solvers for whom development and...

Reduce Length of Stay (LOS) for admission and discharge
Reduce Left Before Being Seen (LBBS)
Reduce Door to Provider times
Reduce discharges Against Medical Advice (AMA)
Decrease 72 Hour Return Visits
Increase patient satisfaction
Reduce emergency department risk exposure
Increase staff satisfaction
Improve financial performance

Download our premier executive resource on Lean Process Improvement in Healthcare: How to Achieve the Impossible.
