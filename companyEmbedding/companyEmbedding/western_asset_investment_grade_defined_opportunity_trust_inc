  Western Asset Investment Grade Defined Opportunity Trust Inc. (NYSE: IGI) announces its portfolio composition as of March 31, 2017.  Investment Objectives: The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide current income and then to liquidate and distribute substantially all of the Fund's net assets to stockholders on or about December 2, 2024. Capital appreciation is a secondary investment objective.  Investment Strategy: The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade corporate fixed income securities of varying maturities.              Portfolio Composition*:               Asset Allocation         Investment Grade Corporate Bonds        78.2%      High Yield Corporate Bonds      14.3%      Emerging Market      7.2%      Corporates External Currency      2.3%      Sovereign Debt External Currency      4.7%      Sovereign Debt Local Currency      0.2%      Municipal      0.4%      Cash & Other Securities      -0.2%             Credit Quality Allocation    **         AAA     1.5%     AA     5.8%     A     32.9%     BBB     41.7%     BB     11.2%     B     6.3%     CCC     1.2%     Not Rated     -0.4%             Top Ten Investment Grade Industries        Banking     19.8%     Communications     12.8%     Energy     11.6%     Insurance     5.1%     Electric     5.0%     Consumer Non Cyclical     4.8%     Finance Companies     4.2%     Basic Industry     3.2%     Capital Goods     3.0%     Consumer Cyclical     2.9%                   Top Five High Yield Industries        Banking     4.0%     Finance Companies     2.4%     Communications     2.4%     Energy     2.2%     Electric     1.3%            Average Life (years)     12.0      Effective Duration (years)     7.3      Average Coupon (%)     6.3            Portfolio Statistics:              Inception Date   June 26, 2009      Inception Price   $20.00      Total Assets***   $222,323,377      Loans****     0.0%      Preferred Shares****     0.0%      Reverse Repos****     0.0%            Market Price   $20.38      NAV   $20.57     (Daily NAV is available on market quotation systems using the symbol XIGIX.)            Distribution Amount   $0.0900 per share      Frequency   Monthly (declared monthly, paid monthly)                 *       Portfolio holdings and weightings are historical and are presented here for informational purposes only. They are subject to change at any time. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100%, if any, are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.     **      Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.     ***     The Fund will not leverage its capital structure by issuing senior securities such as preferred shares or debt instruments. The Fund will also not borrow money for the purpose of leverage. The Fund may invest in reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments which can increase the risks and volatility of the Fund.     ****     Percentages are based on total assets. If the Fund employs leverage, the Effective Duration is based on net assets.                Western Asset Investment Grade Defined Opportunity Trust Inc., a non-diversified closed-end investment management company, is advised by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and is sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, an affiliate of the advisor.
