Introduction | BBR Partners

























 
 



Introduction

An exclusive wealth advisor.
For more than a decade, we have stayed focused on family wealth so our clients can focus on what is important to them.








Family Expertise
When we founded BBR Partners in 2000 as a multi-family office, we were looking to create an alternative to the Wall Street firms that service institutional investors. We believed then, as we do now, that the needs of wealthy families differ significantly from those of other investors. Our sole focus on families has given us a deep understanding of the unique tax situations, intra-family dynamics and investment requirements of high-net-worth individuals. We remain committed to providing the holistic approach that multigenerational families need.
Independence and Transparency
Our business model is straightforward: we align our objectives solely with those of our clients. We have no internal managers and do not receive compensation from anyone other than our clients. Therefore our only incentive is to understand each client’s needs and to act in their best interest. We combine years of Wall Street experience and extensive resources with objectivity to provide unbiased advice to meet each family’s unique goals.

 
Collaboration and Ingenuity
Our collaborative approach to multidisciplinary management enhances our ability to tackle issues from multiple perspectives. Whether it is effective philanthropy, tax efficiency or family education, the depth and breadth of our collective knowledge allows us to design unique solutions for any issue a client may face.
 






Firm Snapshot

Client minimum of $20 million in investable assets
Founded in 2000 as a multi-family office
Serving more than 120 clients with over $12 billion in assets under management
Consistent leadership; no turnover at the Partner level in our history
Exceptionally high staff-to-family ratio
Located in New York, San Francisco and Chicago


Stability and Accountability
With no turnover of leadership and no acquisitions in our 17-year history, we have become a stable and enduring presence in our clients’ lives. We have maintained thoughtful growth, expanding organically to preserve our heritage of highly personalized solutions and service. We hire and train employees who embody a strong sense of personal accountability and commitment to our clients’ well-being. We are proud of our high employee and client retention, which we view as a testament to our commitment to excellence.

Investing for Families | BBR Partners

























 
 



Investing for Families

An exclusive wealth advisor.
For more than a decade, we have stayed focused on family wealth so our clients can focus on what is important to them.







Transparency, Objectivity and Breadth
As no one firm can excel in all areas of in-house investment management, we are structured as an independent manager of managers, accessing top investment managers by selecting from the array all firms have to offer. We do not receive any compensation from any investment managers or third-party providers, allowing us to objectively select the most appropriate managers for each client.
Unique Approach to Asset Allocation
We believe that long-term results begin and end with the right mix of asset classes. For this reason, we create customized asset allocations, focusing on sophisticated strategies instead of simplistic definitions of asset classes. We carefully evaluate each investment to determine its risk/return characteristics, then structure unique asset allocations with complementary low-risk and aggressive components.
Thoughtful Risk for Optimal Returns
We understand how to combine managers with low correlations to one another to create diversified and tax-efficient portfolios, customized to best suit the needs of each client. Regardless of an individual’s risk-tolerance, our goal is to take smart risks, where the upside is attractive enough to outweigh the downside. We manage risk by having a deep understanding of current and potential quality managers.






BBR’s Investment Services

Develop customized asset allocations
Leverage networks of managers
Conduct intensive due diligence on identified managers
Monitor managers on an ongoing basis


Strategic and Opportunistic Investing 
While each client’s strategic allocation is determined by their individual long-term objectives, we act tactically within particular strategies as opportunities become more or less attractive. Client portfolios are dynamically positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace in multiple ways including strategy weightings, manager selection and security selection.

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (6.29% upside)

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
