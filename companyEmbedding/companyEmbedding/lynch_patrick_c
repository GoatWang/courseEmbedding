Early career[edit]
While attending St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Lynch excelled at basketball and baseball. He went on to attend Brown University, where he led the basketball team to its first Ivy League Championship and its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
He graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Economics and Political Science in 1987 and took graduate courses at Queen's University of Belfast while playing professional basketball in Northern Ireland and taking part in a program called Sports Corps, modeled after the Peace Corps.
After returning to the United States, Lynch earned a J.D. from Suffolk University Law School in 1992. He then worked for two years as a clerk for Presiding Superior Court Joseph Rodgers, Jr., and then joined the R.I. attorney general's office in 1994. Lynch was eventually named lead prosecutor of the state's Organized Crime Unit. In 1999, Lynch joined Rhode Island law firm Tillinghast Licht Perkins Smith & Cohen, where he worked until being elected attorney general.[2][3]
Political career[edit]
Lynch formally announced his candidacy in March 2002 after incumbent Sheldon Whitehouse announced he would run for governor. Lynch was a well connected member of the Democratic Party - his father was a former Mayor of Pawtucket, Rhode Island and his brother was serving as Chairman of the R.I. Democratic Party. Lynch faced J. William Harsch, a former director of the R.I. Department of Environmental Management, who ran as an independent but had the endorsement of the state Republican Party.[4] Lynch won the election with 62 percent of the vote.[5]
While in office, Lynch has advocated for stricter laws regarding drunken-driving and the use of handguns. He has also proposed measures that would link school attendance rates and teenagers' driving privileges, increase penalties against people who provide alcohol to minors, and require school districts to put in place anti-bullying and school-safety plans. He has also called for community prosecution, and has paired state prosecutors with police personnel in Providence Police Department's neighborhood precincts with the goal of timely prosecution of drug crimes, robbery, and assault.[6]
Lynch has hung a plaque in his office with a quote from Spider-Man, "With great power comes great responsibility." Lynch said he got the inspiration for the plaque from his son, who said it before his inauguration in 2003.[7]
The Station nightclub fire[edit]
One of Lynch's first responsibilities as attorney general was to oversee the criminal investigation of the February 20, 2003, Station nightclub fire in West Warwick. With 100 deaths and many more injuries, the fire was the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history and the second-deadliest fire ever in Rhode Island, trailing only the USS Bennington fire that claimed 103 lives in the 1950s. The criminal investigation led to the sentencing of Daniel Biechele, the tour manager of the band whose pyrotechnics started the fire, and also resulted in no-contest pleas by the two co-owners of the nightclub.[8]
Lead paint lawsuit[edit]
Lynch has also continued to pursue a lawsuit against lead paint manufactures that was initiated by Whitehouse, his predecessor. The initial lawsuit ended in a mistrial while Whitehouse was in office. Lynch won a second lawsuit against Sherwin Williams Co., NL Industries, and Millennium Holdings, LLC., all former lead paint manufacturers. Another company, Atlantic Richfield Co., was acquitted by the jury. The case was closely monitored by other states and municipalities interested in whether former lead paint manufacturers are liable for problems their products caused after they stopped manufacturing it.[9]
DuPont Co. settled out of court in June 2005, agreeing to pay $12 million to the Children's Health Forum. The agency agreed to use the money for lead paint abatement efforts and education campaigns. Lynch has since been criticized for accepting $4,250 in contributions from DuPont lawyers and lobbyists, and his opponent in the 2006 elections filed a complaint with the Rhode Island Ethics Commission. Lynch has denied that the donations were related to the lawsuit, and a lawyer for DuPont who accounted (with his wife) for $2,500 of the donations called the complaint "rubbish."[10]
Lynch has also been criticized for the arrangement his office made with the law firm Motley Rice, which prosecuted the case. The firm agreed to cover the costs of the case in return for 16 2⁄3 percent of whatever damages the company won. Critics have charged that this kind of relationship between law firm and government is improper because the law firms stand to benefit from a guilty verdict.[11]
2008 Presidential race: Endorsement of Barack Obama[edit]
Lynch was the second of the only two superdelegates in Rhode Island to publicly endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary on February 9, 2008. The first being Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy on January 28, 2008.[12] Ultimately, Barack Obama lost the Rhode Island Democratic primary on March 4, 2008 to Hillary Clinton.
Gubernatorial campaign[edit]
On May 22, 2009, Lynch announced his candidacy for Governor of Rhode Island in the 2010 gubernatorial election.[13]
On August 6, 2009, Lynch was warned by the State Board of Elections that he needed to more carefully disclose his campaign spending. At issue was some $9,000 in petty cash transactions that were not properly documented. The State Board of Elections did not fine Lynch whose campaign filed corrected paperwork amidst being confronted with the issue. The complaint was filed by the Rhode Island Republican Party.[14]
On July 15, 2010, Lynch announced his exit from the Governors race, and endorsed fellow Democrat Frank Caprio. In his statement, Lynch said: "I did not enter public service to become a footnote in history by injuring my party, resulting in the election of a governor who is not equipped to guide our wonderful State into the future it deserves."[15]
Current Activities[edit]
Since leaving his post as attorney general, he has been accused of lobbying his former office several times on behalf of topics such as online gambling and Google Search engine practices via his firm the Patrick Lynch Group. Whilst he has never registered with the state as a lobbyist, he denies that his communications with the office of current Attorney General constitute lobbying.[16]
Additionally, he is a member of a law and consulting firm, Patrick Lynch Law[17]

Whistleblower Forced Out After Leaking Complaints Against Cop Who Killed Eric Garner
Huffington Post - 4 months

 
 A New York City agency that investigates police misconduct forced an employee to resign this week after the worker leaked information about the officer who killed Eric Garner with a banned chokehold.  
 The unidentified employee of the Civilian Complaint Review Board handed over grievance documents filed against Daniel Pantaleo, revealing that the officer had four substantiated complaints on record before his fatal encounter with Garner in 2014, but received next to no punishment. The complaints were published Tuesday by ThinkProgress.  
 The New York Police Department immediately decried the leak and sought a culprit. Top brass cited a 40-year-old law that allows it to keep disciplinary records under wraps ― and that the department suddenly started relying on last year. The employee resigned Thursday rather than get fired, according to the New York Daily News. The employee had never worked on investigations into Pantaleo’s wrongdoing.  
 The paperwork (embedded below) shows that Pan

The Logic of the Police State
Huffington Post - over 1 year

People Are Waking Up to the Darkness in American Policing, and the Police Don't Like It One Bit 
 
Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com 
 
 If you’ve been listening to various police agencies and their supporters, then you know what the future holds: anarchy is coming -- and it’s all the fault of activists.  
 In May, a Wall Street Journal op-ed warned of a “new nationwide crime wave” thanks to “intense agitation against American police departments” over the previous year. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie went further. Talking recently with the host of CBS’s Face the Nation, the Republican presidential hopeful asserted that the Black Lives Matter movement wasn’t about reform but something far more sinister. “They’ve been chanting in the streets for the murder of police officers,” he insisted. Even the nation’s top cop, FBI Director James Comey, weighed in at the University of Chicago Law School, speaking of “a chill wind that has blown through American law enforcement over the last year.

Four Emergency Workers Barred From Duty Following NYPD Chokehold Death
Huffington Post - about 3 years

By Jonathan Allen 
 
NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Four emergency responders have been put on modified duty while authorities investigate their response to a man, suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, who died after New York police put him in a chokehold, a fire department official said on Sunday. 
 
The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians will not be permitted to respond to 911 calls while the death of Eric Garner, who was 43, is investigated, the fire department official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not a department spokesman. 
 
Garner's death, the cause of which is still being determined by the city's medical examiner, has provoked outrage. 
 
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who promised to improve frayed relations between police and the public when he took office in January, called the death a "terrible tragedy" and promised a "thorough" investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and the police department's internal affairs bureau.

NYPD Monitor Plan Prompts Police Unions To Fight Against Oversight
Huffington Post - almost 4 years

NEW YORK — New York City's police unions are seeking to stop a federal monitor from overseeing the NYPD.  
The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association filed motions Thursday in Manhattan federal court on behalf of four police unions, and the Sergeant's Benevolent Association filed separately. They took the first steps to appeal a federal judge's decision last month on the department's stop and frisk policy and are asking the court to intervene in the case.  
Police have stopped, questioned and sometimes patted down about 5 million people over the past decade. The judge ruled that the policy violated the civil rights of hundreds of thousands of black and Hispanic men. She ordered a monitor to oversee changes to the policy including officer training, supervision, and paperwork.  
If the motions are granted, they unions say they will allow them to have an active role in the appeal and any changes that come.

'Go Home Or Face Arrest' Campaign Criticized By British Clergy
Huffington Post - almost 4 years


         CANTERBURY, England (RNS) Two leading clergymen — one Catholic, the other Anglican — condemned a British government billboard and stop-and-search campaign aimed at picking up illegal immigrants and deporting them. 

 Bishop Nick Baines, the Anglican leader of Bradford in northern England, derided the Ministry of Home Affairs’ controversial “go home” bus and van campaign and described it as divisive and ineffective. 

 Bishop Patrick Lynch, one of the Roman Catholic Church’s authorities on immigration, said the government’s billboard campaign targeting illegal immigrants in several London boroughs left the impression all immigrants and foreigners are unwelcome in England. 

 Earlier this month, bus and van ads appeared across London with the slogan: “Go home or face arrest.” The Ministry of Home Affairs paid for the ads. 

 A summer immigration crackdown has included spot identity checks and regular Ministry of Home Affairs updates on Twitter detailing the number of people arre

Quinn: Agreement Reached Over Inspector General For NYPD Practices
Huffington Post - over 4 years


         NEW YORK — The New York Police Department would get a new watchdog under a deal city lawmakers reached Tuesday, propelling a plan galvanized by outrage over its extensive use of the tactic known as stop and frisk and its widespread spying on Muslims. 

 City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced the pact on installing an inspector general for the nation's biggest police department. She said talks were progressing on three companion proposals to set new rules surrounding stop and frisk, including expanding protections against racial profiling. 
         The developments come amid a federal trial over the department's use of stop and frisk, and they follow a series of stories by The Associated Press that revealed how city police systematically listened in on sermons, hung out at cafes and other public places, infiltrated colleges and photographed people as part of a broad effort to prevent terrorist attacks.

The Saturday Morning Post: Quick hits on politics & more in RI
This webpage is not available - almost 5 years

 Welcome to another edition of my weekend column – as always, send along your takes, tips and trial balloons to tnesi@wpri.com. 
 1. With the presidential race dominating the headlines and Mitt Romney stumbling, the challenge facing Brendan Doherty to win in a presidential year is becoming starker. As Ian Donnis wrote recently, Doherty’s strategy relies on separating himself from national Republicans, which isn’t easy when they’re front and center on the evening news. Doherty supporters can point to 1988, when the 1st District simultaneously backed a Democratic presidential nominee (Mike Dukakis) and a moderate Republican (Ron Machtley) to replace a tarnished Democratic congressman (Freddie St Germain). But Rhode Island has gotten much bluer over the intervening 24 years: Barack Obama won the state by nearly 27 points in 2008, more than doubling Dukakis’s 11-point margin. Moreover, Machtley wasn’t as isolated as Doherty – voters in 1988 reelected Republican U.S. Sen. John Chafee by nine

NYC officer pleads not guilty to manslaughter in death of unarmed suspect in his home
Fox News - about 5 years

 A police officer was indicted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed drug suspect, the first time a New York City officer has faced criminal charges in a fatal shooting since a groom was killed in a 50-shot police barrage on his wedding day in 2006. 
               New York Police Department Officer Richard Haste, 30, surrendered Wednesday morning. Haste pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in a courtroom filled with officers, relatives of 18-year-old Ramarley Graham and their supporters. 
               "We're not looking for revenge. We're looking for justice," the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family supporter, said afterward. 
               Dozens of officers applauded Haste, who was on crutches because of an unrelated accident, when he left the courthouse after posting $50,000 bail. As a police union official made a statement, a small group of protesters chanted anti-police slogans behind him. 
               The February shooting stemmed from an NYPD investigation of a persistent drug

2006

Age 41





Lynch has since been criticized for accepting $4,250 in contributions from DuPont lawyers and lobbyists, and his opponent in the 2006 elections filed a complaint with the Rhode Island Ethics Commission.

Lynch has denied that the donations were related to the lawsuit, and a lawyer for DuPont who accounted (with his wife) for $2,500 of the donations called the complaint "rubbish."
 Lynch has also been criticized for the arrangement his office made with the law firm Motley Rice, which prosecuted the case. The firm agreed to cover the costs of the case in return for 16 percent of whatever damages the company won. Critics have charged that this kind of relationship between law firm and government is improper because the law firms stand to benefit from a guilty verdict.

2003

Age 38





Lynch has hung a plaque in his office with a quote from Spider-Man, "With great power comes great responsibility." Lynch said he got the inspiration for the plaque from his son, who said it before his inauguration in 2003.

One of Lynch's first responsibilities as attorney general was to oversee the criminal investigation of the February 20, 2003, Station nightclub fire in West Warwick. With 100 deaths and many more injuries, the fire was the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history and the second-deadliest fire ever in Rhode Island, trailing only the U.S.S. Bennington fire that claimed 103 lives in the 1950s. The criminal investigation led to the sentencing of Daniel Biechele, the tour manager of the band whose pyrotechnics started the fire, and also resulted in no-contest pleas by the two co-owners of the nightclub.
 Lynch has also continued to pursue a lawsuit against lead paint manufactures that was initiated by Whitehouse, his predecessor. The initial lawsuit ended in a mistrial while Whitehouse was in office. Lynch won a second lawsuit against Sherwin Williams Co. NL Industries, and Millennium Holdings, LLC., all former lead paint manufacturers. Another company, Atlantic Richfield Co., was acquitted by the jury. The case was closely monitored by other states and municipalities interested in whether former lead paint manufacturers are liable for problems their products caused after they stopped manufacturing it.





2002

Age 37





Lynch formally announced his candidacy in March 2002 after incumbent Sheldon Whitehouse announced he would run for governor.

Lynch was a well connected member of the Democratic Party - his father was a former Mayor of Pawtucket, Rhode Island and his brother was serving as Chairman of the R.I. Democratic Party. Lynch faced J. William Harsch, a former director of the R.I. Department of Environmental Management, who ran as an independent but had the endorsement of the state Republican Party. Lynch won the election with 62 percent of the vote.
 While in office, Lynch has advocated for stricter laws regarding drunken-driving and the use of handguns. He has also proposed measures that would link school attendance rates and teenagers' driving privileges, increase penalties against people who provide alcohol to minors, and require school districts to put in place anti-bullying and school-safety plans. He has also called for community prosecution, and has paired state prosecutors with police personnel in Providence Police Department's neighborhood precincts with the goal of timely prosecution of drug crimes, robbery, and assault.

                            Patrick C. Lynch
                        


 
Patrick C. Lynch   Location:  Providence, Rhode Island Phone:  			401-680-0921			877-317-9690  Fax:  			401-274-3326  Email:   Email Me     Serving from 2003 to 2010, Patrick C. Lynch, 45, was the 72nd person to hold the office of Rhode Island Attorney General since its inception in 1650. A former State prosecutor, he made reducing juvenile crime the centerpiece of his administration, believing that the career criminals of tomorrow start off as the youth offenders of today.Lynch has had a strong voice in the shaping of legislation aimed at toughening the state's criminal justice system, advancing the rights of victims, and affording additional protections to consumers.Lynch took the lead in defeating efforts to site an LNG facility in Providence and has joined with anti-LNG forces in nearby Fall River, Massachusetts, where another facility - also requiring marine transport of LNG through Rhode Island waters and along its coastal communities - has been proposed. Stating that safety and security measures are inadequate to protect the public, the infrastructure, and the environment, he continues to advocate for the sovereign rights of states against the unwanted introduction of LNG terminals.In response to an increase in the number of crimes committed against senior citizens in Rhode Island, which has one of the nation's highest concentrations of the elderly, Lynch established, in 2005, a specialized Elder Abuse Unit within the Department of Attorney General. The Unit's primary functions are investigating reports of alleged exploitation of seniors and prosecuting crimes involving elderly victims of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation.Committed to championing the civil liberties of all Rhode Islanders, Lynch created, with legislative approval, the Attorney General's Office of Civil Rights Advocate in 2005. This specialized unit empowers the Attorney General to be more proactive in protecting the rights of Rhode Islanders from civil rights violations involving race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, and age.As Attorney General, Lynch visited at least a school a week - making hundreds of such visits since first taking office in January 2003 - to speak to children about making good choices in their lives. "Talking to kids in their classrooms is much better than prosecuting them in our courtrooms," he tells parent and teacher groups. He is also an unwavering advocate for the Rhode Island Judiciary's anti-truancy and anti-drug initiatives, the Truancy and Drug Courts. In 2004, the New England Association of Drug Court Professionals presented him with its President's Award for his "support of drug courts and their graduates."Lynch's leadership on important legal and social issues has earned him the respect of his peers throughout the nation. It was while hosting the National Association of Attorneys General's (NAAG) 2008 Summer Meeting in Rhode Island that Lynch was inducted as President of NAAG. His election marked the first time a Rhode Island Attorney General was chosen to serve in NAAG's top leadership position. In selecting The Year of the Child as his presidential initiative, Attorney General Lynch built on his work of furthering protections for youth, including increasing safeguards in the area of technology such as those attained by recent agreements with attorneys general and social networking sites, as well as the nation's cable operators.A 1987 graduate of Brown University, Attorney General Lynch earned his law degree from Suffolk University Law School. As a Special Assistant Attorney General from 1994 to 1999, he prosecuted cases at every level of Rhode Island's criminal justice system and led the State's prosecution of gang-related offenses. Lynch worked for one of Rhode Island's top law firms until the 2002 election, which capped his first campaign for public office.
