Rights Offering;
Standby Commitment .
 
(a)

      
Prospectus.  As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, a
final prospectus supplement relating to the Rights Offering (the
“ Prospectus Supplement ”), which will
supplement the base prospectus contained in the Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-214043) (the “
Registration Statement ”) filed by the Company with
the SEC and declared effective on November 2, 2016.  Such base
prospectus, in the form in which it appears in the Registration
Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement is
hereinafter referred to as the “Prospectus.”  The
Prospectus Supplement shall be provided to the Standby Purchasers
and their counsel prior to its filing with the SEC, and the Standby
Purchasers and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Prospectus Supplement
(and any post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement
and any other amendments or supplements to the Prospectus that may
be filed prior to the Closing or otherwise in connection with the
Rights Offering).  The Prospectus Supplement shall reflect the
terms of the Rights Offering as set forth in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the recitals set forth
above).
 
(b)

   
Rights Offering .  Promptly following the date on which
the Prospectus Supplement is filed with the SEC, the Company shall
distribute the Prospectus to the Company’s stockholders of
record as of the Record Date and thereafter promptly commence the
Rights Offering upon the terms set forth herein.  The Rights
offering shall remain open for at least twenty (20) days, but no
more than thirty (30) days, or such longer period as the Board of
Directors of the Company determines is necessary to comply with
applicable law.  Prior to the termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall not amend any of the terms of the Rights Offering
described in this Agreement (including, without limitation, in the
recitals set forth above), terminate the Rights Offering or waive
any material conditions to the closing of the Rights Offering, in
each case, without the prior written consent of all of the Standby
Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights
Offering, the Company shall effect the closing of the Rights
Offering as promptly as practicable following the end of the
Subscription Period. The closing of the Rights Offering shall occur
at the time, for the Subscription Price and in the manner and on
the terms set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, which terms shall
be consistent with this Agreement in all respects.
 
 
(c)

   
Standby Purchase Commitment . If upon the expiration of the
Rights Offering there are any Remaining Shares, each Standby
Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
agrees to issue and sell to such Standby Purchaser (or its
designee), at the Subscription Price, its Pro Rata Portion of the
lesser of the First Standby Shares and the Remaining Shares. If the
number of Remaining Shares is greater than the number of First
Standby Shares, and if following exercise by the Company’s
stockholders of the Oversubscription Rights and after giving effect
to all of the Standby Purchasers’ purchase of shares pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence there are Unsubscribed Shares
available, each Standby Purchaser agrees to purchase from the
Company, and the Company agrees to issue and sell to such Standby
Purchaser (or its designee), at the Subscription Price, its Pro
Rata Share of the lesser of such remaining Unsubscribed Shares and
the Maximum Additional Standby Shares (the lesser of the foregoing
(if any), together with the First Standby Shares that the Standby
Purchasers are  obligated to purchase hereunder, the “
Standby Shares ”). Each Standby Purchaser acknowledges
that the precise number of Standby Shares it will be obligated to
purchase hereunder is yet to be determined, and could be its Pro
Rata Portion of the full number of First Standby Shares and Maximum
Additional Standby Shares. The offering of the Standby Shares to
the Standby Purchasers is referred to herein as the “
Standby Offering ”.

 
2

 





 
(d)

   
Amount of Standby Shares . During the Rights Offering, the
Company will regularly advise each Standby Purchaser of the number
of shares of Common Stock for which stockholders have exercised
their Rights and will promptly respond to inquiries from any
Standby Purchaser in that regard. Promptly, but in no event more
than two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the Rights
Offering, the Company will determine the number of Standby Shares
and notify each Standby Purchaser in writing of the number of
Standby Shares and the aggregate purchase price for such shares,
determined as provided herein (the “ Closing Purchase
Amount ”), as well as each Standby Purchaser’s Pro
Rata Portion of the Standby Shares and Closing Purchase
Amount.
 
(e)

   
Closing . On the basis of the representations and warranties
and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the
closing of the purchase and sale of the Standby Shares (the “
Closing ”) shall take place at the offices of
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Chicago, Illinois on the same day as the
closing of the purchase and sale of the shares subscribed for in
the Rights Offering, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably
practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
following such date) (as applicable, the “ Closing
Date ”). At the Closing, the Company shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to each Standby Purchaser (or its designee)
one or more certificates (or evidence of book-entry records)
representing such Standby Purchaser’s Pro Rata Portion of the
Standby Shares, and such Standby Purchaser shall deliver (or cause
to be delivered) to the Company, by wire transfer, such Standby
Purchaser’s Pro Rata Portion of the Closing Purchase Amount.
  
 
(f)

   
Assignment to Affiliates .  Each Standby Purchaser
shall have the right to arrange for one or more of its Affiliates
(each, an “ Affiliated Purchaser ”) or one or
more other Standby Purchasers to purchase any Standby Shares
otherwise to be purchased by such Standby Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement, by written notice to the Company at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, which notice shall be
signed by the Standby Purchaser making such arrangement and each
Affiliated Purchaser or other Standby Purchaser to which such
arrangement relates, and shall contain a confirmation by such
Affiliated Purchaser or other Standby Purchaser of the accuracy
with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 3.
In no event will any such arrangement relieve any Standby Purchaser
from its obligations under this Agreement (except that the
obligation of the Standby Purchaser making such arrangement to
purchase any of its Pro Rata Portion of the Standby Shares shall be
reduced to the extent that Affiliated Purchasers or other Standby
Purchasers purchase any of such Standby Shares at the
Closing).
 
(g)

   
Expense Reimbursement .  In consideration for each
Standby Purchaser’s commitment to purchase the Standby Shares
upon the terms set forth herein, the Company will promptly
reimburse or pay, as the case may be, on the Closing Date, or if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, within two
Business Days following such termination, the out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by such Standby Purchaser in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, the Rights Offering, the Standby Offering, the
Prospectus, and any subsequent registration statement, prospectus
or prospectus supplement covering the resale of the Standby Shares,
the commitment to purchase the Standby Shares hereunder and the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any other document
or instruments contemplated hereby), including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel to each Standby Purchaser (collectively,
“ Transaction Expenses ”). The provision for the
payment of the Transaction Expenses is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without this
provision no Standby Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement.
 
(h)

    No
Oversubscription .  Without limiting the rights of the
Standby Purchasers hereunder (including, without limitation, the
right to purchase the First Standby Shares or the Maximum
Additional Standby Shares), each Standby Purchaser agrees that it
will not exercise any of its Oversubscription Rights in the Rights
Offering.
