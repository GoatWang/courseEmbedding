Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a recommendation by GSAM to buy, sell, or hold any security. An investment in alternatives is not appropriate for all investors. Please see additional disclosures. Note that alternative investing is not suitable for all investors and liquid alternatives are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set















Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns









For Illustrative Purposes Only. Source: Bloomberg, GSAM. Underlying Indices: Core Equity – S&P 500 Index; Core Fixed Income – Barclays US Agg Bond Index; Alternatives – HFRIFOF Index. Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

*Growth of $10,000: A graphical measurement of a portfolio's gross return that simulates the performance of an initial investment of $10,000 over the given time period. The example provided does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees which would reduce an investor's return. Please be advised that since this example is calculated gross of fees the compounding effect of an investment manager's fees are not taken into consideration and the deduction of such fees would have a significant impact on the returns the greater the time period and as such the value of the $10,000, if calculated on a net basis, would be significantly lower than shown in this example.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.










Solving a Return Conundrum

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.

Investment Approach

											Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS is a fund of hedge funds that, through its ultimate master fund, Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund ("ARF"), invests substantially all its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge funds) that are managed by a select group of alternative investment managers who employ different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of attractive risk-adjusted returns (returns adjusted to take into account volatility of those returns) consistent with the preservation of capital and not highly correlated with fixed income or equity indices.

							Past performance is not indicative of future results.
							
							
								
									Growth of investment performance is since the Fund's inception date, based on the net of fees return experience of the Fund. Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees;  2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.50% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% (0.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. Performance links monthly performance through compound multiplication. Results are hypothetical.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS, as applicable, carefully before investing. The prospectus for each of the Funds contains this and other information about the relevant Fund and can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor. Please read the prospectus of the relevant Fund carefully before investing.
Each of the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS is a Delaware statutory trust that issues shares.
Morgan Stanley does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Your clients should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situations.
Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. is a principal underwriter of the Funds. Morgan Stanley is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory services.
Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
Risk Considerations
Alternative investments, like the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS are speculative and include a high degree of risk.
Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. The Funds are suitable only for long-term investors willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. The Funds are highly illiquid - there is no secondary market for the shares of these Funds, and there are restrictions on redemptions or assigning or otherwise transferring interests in these Funds. The Funds have higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower the returns achieved by investors. Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. The underlying funds in which the Funds invest (the "Underlying Funds") often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. The Underlying Funds are often unregulated, and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. 
See Risk Factors and Other Considerations for important disclosures. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity and therefore should be viewed as a long-term investment. For a complete description of terms and conditions, fees and other expenses, see the Fund's prospectus.
The Fund is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Fund or shares in the Fund that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Fund. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material. This does not constitute an offer to, or solicitation of, such person or entity.
Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return based on information received from ARF's underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals. The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees; 2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of ARF's underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.50% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% (0.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. 
a In parallel with ARF, subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV of ARF.
b The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses (2.58%), trading expenses (2.26%) and performance-based incentive fees of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund was invested (0.81%) for the period ended December 31, 2016. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. Trading expenses are primarily interest and dividend expenses and are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Managers in order to enhance the Investment Funds’ returns. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds’ managers/general partners in the form of management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive allocations generally ranging from 10% to 30% of net profits earned. Some Investment Funds employ a pass-through expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historical fees and expenses. Future Investment Funds’ fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds, which may fluctuate over time.
c The Total Annual Fund Expenses include the Fund’s Management Fee (1.00%), Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (5.65%), Interest Payments on Borrowed Funds (0.51%) and Other Expenses (1.43%).

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management Launches the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS (''Absolute Return Fund STS''); Absolute Return Fund STS Demonstrates Further Enhancement of Alternative Investment Offerings






August 07, 2006 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



				NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 7, 2006--Morgan Stanley Investment Management ("MSIM") announced today that it has launched the Absolute Return Fund STS, an institutional-quality portfolio of hedge funds for special tax status investors, namely, tax-exempt and tax-deferred individual investors and smaller institutional clients. Expanding on the April 2006 launch of the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund ("Absolute Return Fund") available to taxable investors, the Absolute Return Fund STS now allows the SEC-registered fund of hedge fund offerings of Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners ("Morgan Stanley AIP") to be available to investors with taxable, tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts.  With the launch of the Absolute Return Fund STS, tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts, such as endowment funds, certain trust accounts and IRAs that are accredited investors, have access to hedge fund returns without incurring any unrelated business tax income (UBTI) as a result of the hedge fund investments made by Absolute Return Fund. The Absolute Return Fund and Absolute Return Fund STS (together, the "Funds") give investors access to the expertise and established track record of Morgan Stanley AIP for the relatively low minimum initial investment of $100,000. 

 Morgan Stanley AIP, founded in April 2000, manages portfolios of hedge funds and private equity assets for some of the world's largest institutions and high net worth individuals. The Funds are managed by Morgan Stanley AIP's Liquid Markets Team, headed by Mustafa Jama.  "We are excited to bring the expertise of Morgan Stanley AIP to even more of our clients," said Michael Kiley, Head of Americas Retail and Intermediary Distribution. "By filling out the product offering for the absolute return strategy to include tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts, we're continuing to provide innovative solutions to accommodate individual investors' growing demand for a practical entry into the hedge fund marketplace."  The Absolute Return Fund STS is an SEC-registered vehicle that utilizes the same "absolute return strategy" utilized by the Absolute Return Fund to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns over the broad range of market environments - but without the investment activity of the Absolute Return Fund giving rise to any UBTI.  "The Absolute Return Fund STS leverages the attractiveness of the Absolute Return Fund, while ensuring that UBTI is not ultimately incurred by the investor as a result of the Absolute Return Fund's investment activities," said Stuart Bohart, Head of Alternative Investments of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. "The launch of the Absolute Return Fund STS is a natural progression in our efforts to expand our sophisticated product offerings in the alternatives space and also meet the needs of our clients."

The relevant prospectus contains this and other information about such Fund. To obtain a prospectus, contact your financial advisor. Please read such prospectus carefully before investing.  Investment in the Funds involves significant risks due to, among other things, the illiquidity of the interests, the nature of the Funds' investments and actual and potential conflicts of interest, including the payment of fees to persons marketing the Funds and of revenue sharing between the Funds' Adviser and certain of its affiliates. There can be no assurance that the Funds will achieve their investment objective or that there will be any return of capital. Investors should have the financial ability and willingness to accept the risks (including the risk of loss of the entire investment) for a predetermined period of time and should consult their financial, tax and accounting advisors regarding the appropriateness of making an investment in the Funds. This offering is open only to investors who meet certain criteria. Each of the Funds is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Funds or shares in the Funds that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Funds. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation, of an offer to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management ("MSIM") announced
today that it has launched the Absolute Return Fund STS, an
institutional-quality portfolio of hedge funds for special tax status
investors, namely, tax-exempt and tax-deferred individual investors
and smaller institutional clients. Expanding on the April 2006 launch
of the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund ("Absolute
Return Fund") available to taxable investors, the Absolute Return Fund
STS now allows the SEC-registered fund of hedge fund offerings of
Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners ("Morgan Stanley AIP")
to be available to investors with taxable, tax-exempt and tax-deferred
accounts.
   With the launch of the Absolute Return Fund STS, tax-exempt and
tax-deferred accounts, such as endowment funds, certain trust accounts
and IRAs that are accredited investors, have access to hedge fund
returns without incurring any unrelated business tax income (UBTI) as
a result of the hedge fund investments made by Absolute Return Fund.
The Absolute Return Fund and Absolute Return Fund STS (together, the
"Funds") give investors access to the expertise and established track

investment of $100,000.
   Morgan Stanley AIP, founded in April 2000, manages portfolios of

the Absolute Return Fund giving rise to any UBTI.

Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS: No-Action letter dated July 10, 2006
















Home | Previous Page





























 
Investment Company Act of 1940 - Section 7(d) and 12(d)(1)(E)
AIP Absolute Return Fund STS
July 10, 2006



RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL
	DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT


Our Ref. No. 20064201512
	Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS and AIP Absolute
	File No. 811- 21767



Your letter dated July 7, 2006 requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act") against Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS (the "AIP Top-Tier Fund"), a closed-end investment company registered under the Act that proposes to make a registered public offering under the Securities Act of 1933, and AIP Absolute Return Fund LDC company (the "AIP Offshore Fund"), if AIP Offshore Fund offers and sells its securities to AIP Top-Tier Fund and to a limited number of Non-U.S. Investors (as defined in your letter) without registration of AIP Offshore Fund under the Act. In your letter, you describe a three-tier, master-feeder arrangement under which the AIP Top-Tier Fund will acquire securities issued by the AIP Offshore Fund that, in turn, will acquire securities issued by Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund (the "AIP Master Fund"), a closed-end investment company that is registered under the Act. Your letter also requests guidance concerning the application of section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act to the proposed arrangement. 
The proposed arrangement is very similar to the arrrangement described in a no-action letter that we issued on April 30, 2004 to Man-Glenwood Lexington TEI, LLC and Man-Glenwood Lexington TEI, LDC under sections 7(d) and 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act (the "Man-Glenwood Letter"). The Man-Glenwood Letter involved a three-tier master-feeder arrangement whereby the top-tier fund would control and be the sole investor in the offshore fund.1 In the proposed arrangement described in your letter, however, Non-U.S. Investors may invest in the AIP Offshore Fund (to the limited extent described in your letter) although the AIP Top-Tier Fund will control the AIP Offshore Fund. 
You contend that the limited offer and sale of securities by the AIP Offshore Fund to Non-U.S. Investors, as described in your letter, should not affect the analysis of whether the arrangement raises the concerns that section 7(d) was designed to address, or how the arrangement complies with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act. We agree. 
Based on the facts and representations in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under section 7(d) of the Act against the AIP Top-Tier Fund or the AIP Offshore Fund if the AIP Offshore Fund offers and sells its securities to the AIP Top-Tier Fund as described in your letter. Our position is based upon all of the facts and representations set forth in your letter, including your representations that:2 

The AIP Top-Tier Fund and the AIP Master Fund are registered investment companies under the Act. Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, the investment adviser of the AIP Master Fund, is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission. 
The AIP Top-Tier Fund, and no other person, will control the AIP Offshore Fund;3 and the board of trustees of the AIP Top-Tier Fund will conduct the management and business of the AIP Offshore Fund and will not delegate those responsibilities to any other person, other than certain limited administrative activities. 
The AIP Top-Tier Fund will not in any way use the AIP Offshore Fund to evade the provisions of the Act.4 
The proposed arrangement results in the functional equivalent of a typical master-feeder relationship between the AIP Top-Tier Fund and the AIP Master Fund. The proposed arrangement will comply with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act as described below. 
The AIP Top-Tier Fund's assets will consist only of cash and securities issued by the AIP Offshore Fund; the AIP Offshore Fund's assets will consist only of cash and securities issued by the AIP Master Fund. 
The assets of the AIP Offshore Fund will be maintained at all times in the United States, and they will be maintained at all times in accordance with the requirements of section 17(f) of the Act. 
The AIP Offshore Fund will maintain duplicate copies of its books and records at an office located within the United States, and the Commission and its staff will have access to the books and records consistent with the requirements of section 31 of the Act and the rules thereunder. 
The AIP Offshore Fund will designate either the AIP Top-Tier Fund's custodian or the AIP Top-Tier Fund as agent in the United States for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding before the Commission or any appropriate court, and the AIP Offshore Fund will consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts and the Commission over it.

You should note that any different facts and representations might require a different conclusion. Furthermore, this portion of our letter expresses our position on enforcement action only, and does not express any legal conclusions on the issues presented. 
In addition, based on the facts and representations in your letter, we believe that the arrangement for compliance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act that is set forth in the Man-Glenwood letter would apply equally to the proposed arrangement that is described in your letter. We believe that the arrangement would comply with section 12(d)(1)(E) if it operates in the following manner: 

Morgan Stanley Distribution Inc. is a broker or dealer registered as such with the Commission; 
the securities issued by the AIP Offshore Fund will be the only investment securities that are held by the AIP Top-Tier Fund and, in turn, the securities issued by the AIP Master Fund will be the only investment securities held by the AIP Offshore Fund; 
the AIP Offshore Fund's purchase of the AIP Master Fund's securities will be made pursuant to an arrangement among the AIP Top-Tier Fund, the AIP Offshore Fund and the AIP Master Fund, or its principal underwriter, whereby the AIP Offshore Fund is required to seek instructions from the shareholders of the Top-Tier Fund and the Non-U.S. Investors, with regard to the voting of all proxies with respect to the AIP Master Fund's securities that are held by the AIP Offshore Fund and to vote such proxies only in accordance with such instructions; 
the AIP Top-Tier Fund's purchase of the AIP Offshore Fund's securities will be made pursuant to an arrangement with the AIP Offshore Fund, whereby the AIP Top-Tier Fund will be required to seek instructions from its shareholders, with regard to the voting of all proxies with respect to the AIP Offshore Fund's securities held by the AIP Top-Tier Fund and to vote such proxies only in accordance with such instructions;5 and 
the AIP Offshore Fund shall refrain from substituting securities of the AIP Master Fund unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution in the manner provided in section 26 of the Act.

You should note that any different facts and representations might require a different conclusion.
Susan M. Olson
Senior Counsel

Endnotes

1 See Man-Glenwood Letter at footnote 5. 
2 We also rely upon your representation that the proposed arrangement to prevent the receipt of 'unrelated business taxable income' by the Retirement Plans is consistent with the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. 
3 You represent that no single Non-U.S. Investor or group of related Non-U.S. Investors would own more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the AIP Offshore Fund. In addition, you represent that the organizational documents of the AIP Offshore Fund will allow the AIP Offshore Fund to redeem all or a portion of the shares held by one or more Non-U.S. Investors in order to ensure compliance with the Non-U.S. Investor Limitations (as defined in your letter). You also represent that those redemptions would be effected in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Act, as if the AIP Offshore Fund were registered as an investment company with the Commission. 
4 You also represent that the AIP Master Fund will not in any way use the AIP Offshore Fund to evade the provisions of the Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (e.g., section 205 governing the imposition of performance fees). 
5 You represent that no Non-U.S. Investor that meets the definition of investment company in section 3(a) of the Act, including any entity that is excluded from that definition by sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, will be permitted to invest in the AIP Offshore Fund. You have not asked and we take no position regarding the application of section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act to a three-tier master-feeder arrangement in which a Non-U.S. Investor that meets the definition of investment company (including any entity that is excluded from that definition by sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act) invests in the AIP Offshore Fund.

Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a recommendation by GSAM to buy, sell, or hold any security. An investment in alternatives is not appropriate for all investors. Please see additional disclosures. Note that alternative investing is not suitable for all investors and liquid alternatives are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set















Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns









For Illustrative Purposes Only. Source: Bloomberg, GSAM. Underlying Indices: Core Equity – S&P 500 Index; Core Fixed Income – Barclays US Agg Bond Index; Alternatives – HFRIFOF Index. Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

The example provided does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees which would reduce an investor's return. Please be advised that since this example is calculated gross of fees the compounding effect of an investment manager's fees are not taken into consideration and the deduction of such fees would have a significant impact on the returns the greater the time period and as such the value of the $10,000, if calculated on a net basis, would be significantly lower than shown in this example.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.










Solving a Return Conundrum

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.
            









We Believe Now Is the Time to Diversify Your Portfolio with Alternatives





With stock prices and bond yields near record levels, we believe it is unlikely for current trends to continue. Alternatives have historically delivered attractive returns relative to stocks and bonds during challenging market environments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
