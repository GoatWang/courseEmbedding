Jess Ravich Joins TCW as Group Managing Director and Head of Alternative Products



December 03, 2012






LOS ANGELES – December 3, 2012 – The TCW Group (TCW), an international asset-management firm, announced today that it has appointed Jess M. Ravich, 55, as Group Managing Director and Head of Alternative Products. Ravich will spearhead the firm’s efforts to further expand its alternative investment platform and will report directly to TCW President and CEO David Lippman. 
“Historically, TCW has always been a diversified asset management firm that has offered investors a wide variety of investment strategies calibrated to the different objectives of our many clients,” said Lippman. “Alternative products continue to be an extremely important part of our platform and as we seek to expand this offering in-house, I can think of nobody more capable than Jess to lead this effort for us. He has the drive, understanding of the business and the market perspective to help us round out our product suite in this area. I very much look forward to working with him and warmly welcome him to TCW.” 
Most recently Ravich served as a managing director and head of capital markets at Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, Inc., an international investment bank. Prior to joining Houlihan Lokey, Ravich founded Libra Securities LLC, an investment banking firm serving the middle market, where he served as CEO for 18 years. Ravich also brings a wealth of experience from Jefferies & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was an executive vice president of the fixed income department and a senior vice president, respectively. Ravich is a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, summa cum laude, and Harvard Law School, magna cum laude. Ravich is the chairman of the board of directors for The Cherokee Group, Inc. and ALJ Regional Holdings, Inc., and serves on the board of directors of Spectrum Group. 
“TCW is a venerable firm with a long history of providing its clients with a broad range of innovative, value-added investment products,” said Ravich. “The opportunity to continue to expand the alternatives business on what is already an incredibly diverse platform was extremely compelling. I look forward to being part of TCW’s continued success and growth.”
