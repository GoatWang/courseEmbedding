michael marcus Exfoliating Enzyme Peel is a breakthrough in skin exfoliation. The Exfoliating Enzyme Peel is designed to give your skin a fresh, radiant glow day after day.  Daily exfoliation is one of the most important steps in your daily skin care regimen to keep your skin looking younger and to help address the visible signs of aging. Excellent for all skin types. Contains 1.7 oz. Made in the USA.
Benefits 
o Enzymes that help to exfoliate dead skin cells. 
o Gives the skin a fresh radiant appearance. 
o Skin is soft and smooth. 
o Holds in moisture. 
o Moisturizes the skin. 
o Gives the skin a cushioning effect.
Directions 
o Cleanse
o Apply a thin layer of the exfoliating peel to the entire face, wait a few moments then using circular motions continue to massage the peel. You will soon notice the peel starts to become liquefied, and as you continue to massage you will feel small round particles starting to form (these round particles are dead skin cells).
o Rinse thoroughly with tepid water, and pat dry.  Your skin will immediately have more luminosity, and radiance!   Use 2 -3 times a week.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreArea RugsArea rugs provide both functional and stylistic value to a bedroom. They protect your floor from wear and tear (and your feet from a cold floor!), as well as enhance a room’s personality with the various colors, patterns, textures, shapes and sizes that area rugs come in.  When choosing a  bedroom rug, take the following rule of thumb into consideration: Extend the carpet 12-18 inches around the bed. For a king or queen bed, the rug should extend 18 inches out from the sides; for a twin or a full bed, it should extend at least 12 inches out. Depending on the size of the room there can be more extension around the bed, but most definitely not less, as that would make the room look imbalanced and cover the entirety of the rug design with the bed. A few other things to consider — what is your lifestyle like? Do you have pets or children? A white carpet might not be the best alternative in this case, and a sturdier, long-lasting material like wool or jute should be considered. What is your decor style? Make sure you choose a rug that complements and enhances your current aesthetic. How easy is it to clean? Consider if your rug will need to be dry cleaned or if standard vacuuming and carpet cleaning will suffice. Pillows & ThrowsAdding decorative pillows and throw blankets to a bedroom is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your  decor. However, before you start your hunt for the perfect pillow and throw blanket assemblage, consider your current bedroom design. If you have a neutral color palette of soft grays and whites, a few brightly colored pillows or blankets will provide energetic pops of color. If you already have a colorful home, throwing in some subtler shades and patterns might be exactly what you need to complement your style and put the focal point on your polychromatic decor. In general, you should place two to six decorative pillows on your bed. This will be enough to add a new element of style and color, but not so much that you’ll have to spend 20 minutes removing pillows before you go to sleep. Throw blankets can be great arranged at the end of your bed, showcasing their texture and pattern, or elegantly draped over an armchair, ready to snuggle up with.Table LampsTable lamps are one of those great decor items with a dual purpose — they are a complementary accent to your home while providing much-needed light. When choosing lamps, consider this design rule: You should not be able to see the neck of the light bulb, or bulb socket, from a standing or seated position. If you can see it, the lamp is likely too tall for your room and will cause glare for anyone standing or sitting in your bedroom (most likely you!). However, if you find a tall base that you just have to have, get a larger lamp shade to cover the bulb and you’re all set! Tall lamps definitely contribute to an elegant ambience and elevate your room design to new heights (literally). If you want mood lighting or just a more decorative piece, utilize an opaque shade; if you’re an avid reader or need more light in your room, use a translucent lampshade that distributes light throughout the space. Wall Decor & MirrorsThe decor in your  bedroom should be reflective of this space’s purpose - your bedroom is your refuge, your retreat from the real world, and it should make you feel happy, content and inspired. Put up items that create a sense of peace; if you have any specific pictures or pieces that make you happy or remind you of fun times, these are great to include in your design. If you have a large piece of wall art to hang, put it in a place where it can be a focal point and won’t be overshadowed by clutter or other decor.  Hanging and placing mirrors throughout your bedroom will reflect light and make it look larger, as well as provide you ample opportunity to check out your outfit before work.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreMix and match wall decorations for a custom look.Who’s to say novelty signs, mixed-media art and metal wall art don’t belong on the same surface? The key to getting your personalized style right is to pick the pieces that you can’t live without, regardless of their medium or composition. Drawings, paintings, prints and posters have just as much of a right to be together as peanut butter and jelly. That’s not to say that a collection of coordinating photographs can’t look just as stunning, but it’s ultimately your preference that matters.Think beyond the typical home wall decor.Framed photos and pretty pictures are nice, but they aren’t your only option when it comes to decorating bare walls. Consider hanging up a unique rug or an intricate tapestry instead; these are not only visually appealing but add a textural element to your space. Have lots of trinkets and collectibles to display? Mount some attractive wall shelves and arrange them as you see fit. If you don’t want to poke holes through your drywall, try putting up some wallpaper or wall decals, which provide plenty of pizzazz on their own.Browse our wall decor section to find products you’ll love.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat kind of wall decal designs are available?If you can dream up a design, chances are it exists. Wall quotes have become a popular way to express beliefs and display welcoming sayings. Wall decals for kids come in every size, shape and color, and they are an inexpensive way to make your child’s room fun and lively — some options can even be drawn on like a chalkboard! If you can’t find the perfect one among the masses of nursery wall decals and tree wall decal designs, you can always have custom wall decals made to suit your needs. Are removable wall decals suitable for rentals?Yes, almost all decals for walls are removable and will not damage the surface they’re mounted on. So if you’ve been eyeballing that amazing sticker mural that makes you feel like you’re in the middle of a wooded forest, go for it. Always double check the label on your wallsticker to make sure they’re removable before you apply. Browse through decal ideas on Houzz to discover one (or two or three) that fits your space.

Hydration    Exfoliators    LossofFirmness    OilyProblematic    FineLinesWrinkles    Cleansers    
Dry skin is identified as skin severely lacking natural oil and moisture. Characteristics include roughness, flakiness, tightness, fine pore redness, pronounced fine lines around the eyes and mouth, and a thin, fragile texture. The skin may also appear flaky, ashy or dull from dead skin build up.
Daily Skin Care Regimen 
If you have dry skin, you will need moisturizing products that nourish, so you will want to find protective and restorative products. Achieving a moisture balance with the right pH is key. 
Begin with a very mild soap, possibly cream based. Since your skin is acidic, the alkaline in soap can easily disturb the delicate pH balance. Also, make sure that the soap does not contain harsh chemicals which will also remove the acid mantel and cause further dryness. Choose a toner that soothes and nourishes your skin. It should refresh with a hint of moisture—a low or no alcohol formulation is recommended to prevent over drying the skin.
A daily moisturizing routine is essential for dry skin. Begin with a serum to enhance moisture, then apply a day moisturizer. Try to use a day cream with an SPF Your evening ritual can include a serum application and a heavier moisturizer. Eye creams and serums are recommended for the delicate area around the eyes that are subject to fine lines and wrinkles. 
Weekly Skin Care Routine 
Use an extremely mild exfoliator in order to expose fresh skin and allow products to penetrate deeper. This will maximize the effectiveness of your skin care products. A moisture-enhancing mask that you put on and wipe off will moisturize and plump dry and dehydrated skin. 
Product Recommendations: 
Makeup remover 
Cleanser, mild or cream based 
Toner (low or no alcohol)
Morning moisturizer with SPF
Evening moisturizer 
Eye moisturizer 
Serum
Mild exfoliant
Moisture enhancing mask 
Key Ingredients for Dry Skin: 
Hyalauronic Acid, Glycerin, Lanolin, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Oil (Of Jojoba, Olive, Apricot Seed, Avocado, Grapeseed Borage, Almond, Evening Primrose), Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Honey, Shea Butter, Argan, Baobab, Manuka Honey, Green Tea (Camilla Sinsnsis), Ceramide, Glycolic Acid, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Cucumber
Why Moisturize? 
Everyone can benefit from using a moisturizer after cleansing. The key is finding the appropriate moisturizer based on your skin type. Moisturizers seal moisture into the skin, so the effect is hydrating while also inhibiting evaporation. Many moisturizers contain active ingredients that deliver vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and skin supporting compounds to provide therapeutic benefits that sooth, protect and ultimately help delay the onset of early aging.

Eye creams are optional, but may be desirable for those with dry or aging skin as a welcome addendum to a moisturizer. Some individuals have very delicate eye areas that are more susceptible to wrinkling, dark circles and puffiness. An eye cream can help address these specific concerns with intense moisture and a high concentration of active ingredients. 
How to Choose a Moisturizer
The oilier your complexion, the lighter and more liquid your moisturizer should be. Some moisturizers even have oil free ingredients that still serve to moisturize the skin without adding oil. Conversely, dry or aging skin requires a more moisturizing-nourishing preparation. Use a moisturizer labeled with your skin type or specific skin concern. If you live in a particularly harsh climate, consider wearing a more moisturizing face cream during the winter and switch to a lighter formula during warmer months.

Night creams tend to be thicker and more moisturizing than day creams. It is generally recommended to have separate moisturizers simply for the fact that you will want a day cream with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF). This will provide you with added protection from sun damage that can lead to premature aging. 

Based on the amount of time you spend outside on any particular day, you might want to wear a moisturizer designed for outdoor use with a significantly higher SPF. You must also factor in how easily your skin burns and take precautions to protect your skin with a sufficient SPF. As a general rule, it is recommended that your day moisturizer should have at least 15-20 SPF, and if you spend more time outdoors, consider a moisturizer with 30+ SPF. 
How to Use Moisturizer
After you wash your face and apply toner or a serum (optional), scoop out enough moisturizer to comfortably cover your face and neck area. Using your fingertips, rub it in using upward strokes, making sure to moisturize the neck, décolletage and earlobes. In order to prevent streaks, allow your moisturizer to penetrate before applying foundation. 
Why Exfoliate? 
Exfoliation is a very important yet often overlooked step in the beauty regimen. It is the key to loosen and remove a dead layer of skin cells, while speeding up the skin's process of shedding (which slows with aging or mature skin). Exfoliation also helps to stimulate the blood circulation, brighten the complexion by improving color and texture, smooth fine lines and wrinkles, and prevent build-up that can lead to break outs. 

Without exfoliation, skin can take on an uneven tone, looking dull, patchy or even ashy. After exfoliation, skin serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate more effectively, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate more successfully and thus leading to better beauty product results. 

As a general rule, you will want to exfoliate at least once per week. You can adjust your schedule according to your needs. The texture of the exfoliant may also factor in the frequency of usage. A finer grained exfoliator might be tolerated well and could be used more often if desired. If your skin becomes irritated or flaky, reduce the frequency of exfoliating or switch to one with finer texture. 

Sometimes exfoliating ingredients are added to toners or also come in the form of masks. These products provide more options to incorporate exfoliating ingredients into your regimen. 
How to Choose an Exfoliator
Choose an appropriate exfoliator for your skin type. Sensitive, fine or aging skin will need a finer abrasive ingredient than other types of skin. The best way to select one is to read the label description to determine the item's abrasiveness or strength. Salt, sugar, plant fiber, nut hulls, jojoba beads, apricot seeds, kernels, oatmeal, and bamboo beads are all common ingredients used in abrasive exfoliators. 

Enzymes, retinols, alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid and salycilic acid preparations are referred to as chemical exfoliators. They are typically available in varying strengths in the form of a gel or serum. They can also be used once per week, or as desired after cleansing and before moisturizing to attain the same effect. They exfoliate with less irritation, and are especially recommended if your skin is on the sensitive side. 
How to Exfoliate
After cleansing and rinsing the face, apply the exfoliator to your wet face. Using your fingers or a soft cloth, scrub using gentle circular motions. You will want to avoid the delicate eye area and scrub gently on the areas bordering it like the cheek bones and temple area outside of the eyes. Rinse your face and softly pat it dry.  
Skin Firming 
When skin ages, its collagen and elastin are produced more slowly. This causes gradual changes like hyperpigmentation, discoloration, dryness, sagging, wrinkles, crepe-like folds, loss of muscle tone, textural unevenness and loss of elasticity.  

The topical application of key skin firming ingredients works synergistically to protect and strengthen the skin. Skin care products should have a combination of naturally occurring active ingredients. They will contain compounds to protect which will likely be in the form of extracts containing antioxidants. Another set of ingredients will firm the skin by penetrating through its seven layers to support the collagen process at a cellular level. 

Skin firming creams are usually formulated as night creams. They tend to be richer, thicker and more emollient and should be able to stay on long enough to absorb for maximum benefits. In general, face creams are designed to minimize lines/wrinkles, improve skin density, firm, plump and decrease puffiness (especially in the eye area). 

Many manufacturers describe their product as a "cocktail" of ingredients that work together to decrease the effects of aging. Skin firming and anti-aging ingredients often include antioxidants, minerals, seaweed, herb extracts and different kinds of oils like Vitamins A and E. Other ingredients attributed to having a firming effect on the skin include green tea, aloe vera, beech bud extract, alpha lipoic acids, shea butter, hyaluronic acid and the very exotic sounding emu oil. Some firming and anti-aging products also contain light reflecting pigments, such as mica, to enhance the glow and make the skin look radiant. 

You can choose the right skin firming creams according to your skin type (oily, combination or dry) and the anti-aging action associated with them. 
Oily skin is identified as skin with oily areas, pronounced shininess in the T-zone, breakouts, and pores that may be clogged and enlarged. The oiliness can cause makeup to fade prematurely. Finding the right balance is key to this skincare routine.
Daily Skin Care Regimen
If you have acne or oily skin, you want to look for products that absorb oil, hydrate without added oil, and moisturize your skin without oil. 
Cleanse skin both day and night with a mild sudsy or gel cleanser. Use a toner to wipe of residual dirt and soap, and finally follow with a light moisturizer with SPF for the day. Use a product that is mild and light; many times the packaging will indicate that it is non-comedegenic. Products formulated specifically for oily skin condition should be suitable for almost any use. You will want to purchase a skincare line that fits the level of your skin's needs. 
Weekly Skin Care Routine
Exfoliate once or twice per week. This will assist with cell turnover and will expose the healthy skin underneath. Over-exfoliating or exfoliating with harsh ingredients can irritate skin and possibly cause further breakouts, so stick with a product that has micro beads or exfoliating ingredients. 
Use a weekly mask to help cleanse and tighten pores. Masks made with clay effectively absorb excess oil and are highly recommended and essential to controlling an oily complexion. Finally use a spot treatment as needed during the day or night. If skin becomes flaky or irritated, decrease the frequency of use. One final note: Choose your cosmetics and hair care products wisely. Many can be contributors of skin sensitivity or flare-ups.

Aging skin may have any combination of wrinkles, sagging or slack skin around the jowls, chin, cheeks and jawline. It may also have evidence of sun damage (photo damage/hyperpigmentation) in the form of spots or leathery texture. The skin may also feel tight and dry.

Why Cleanse?
When you cleanse your face, you can help control the clarity, suppleness and condition of your skin. Cleansing rids your skin of excess facial oil, dust, bacteria, dirt and dead skin cells. This process helps keep the pores unclogged, improves circulation, and prepares your skin for the next step in your cleansing ritual. Quite possibly the most fundamental step in the beauty routine, cleansing is integral to maintaining a balanced complexion. 

Cleansing is recommended twice per day for most skin types, once in the morning and once in the evening. Any more than that, the natural oils become stripped, while any less and your skin can become susceptible to congestion and eruptions.
How to Choose a Cleanser
Choose a cleanser that is appropriate for your skin and is specifically formulated for the face. Dry skin types will need to use a creamy based cleanser, while oilier types will need a gel based or foaming type cleanser. Sensitive skin needs a fragrance-free formulation, most likely labeled as gentle and non-irritating. 
How to Cleanse
Tie your hair back with a headband or ponytail holder. Make sure to start with clean hands. Splash your face with warm or tepid water to open up your pores. Never use too hot or too cold water. Too hot and your skin can dry out, while water that is too cold will not remove the surface oils sufficiently. You can use a washcloth, sponge, exfoliation puff, facial brush or your fingers for cleansing - It all depends on your preference. 

Use approximately a dime to nickel sized amount of cleanser, follow product packaging instructions. You can apply the cleanser with your fingertips or washcloth. Depending on the cleanser type, you might want to work up a lather in your hands first. 

Use gentle upward circular strokes moving around the face, paying attention to the crevices of the nose area and hair line while extending down your neck and around the ear area. Take extra care to use a gentle touch around the eyes. Do not over-scrub or scrub too hard, as your facial skin is susceptible to become easily irritated. 

Once the cleansing is completed, rinse liberally with tepid water. Make sure all areas are rinsed including the neck, hairline and eye area. Cool water may be used, as it helps to close the pores. Finish by blotting your face gently with a towel using a patting technique.

If you tend to have dry skin, you will need moisturizing products that nourish, so you will want to find protective and restorative products. Achieving a moisture balance with the right pH is key. 
Daily Skin Care Regimen
Begin with a very mild soap, possibly cream based. Since skin can be acidic, the alkaline in soap can easily disturb the delicate pH balance. Also, make sure the soap does not contain harsh chemicals which will also remove the acid mantel and cause further dryness. Choose a toner that soothes and nourishes your skin. It should refresh with a hint of moisture - a low or no alcohol formulation is recommended to prevent over drying the skin.
A daily moisturizing routine is essential to aging skin. After washing skin, pat it dry and begin with a serum to enhance moisture, then apply a day moisturizer. Try to use a day cream with an SPF An evening ritual can include a serum application and a heavier moisturizer. Eye creams and serums are recommended for the delicate area around the eyes that are subject to fine lines and wrinkles.
Weekly Skin Care Routine 
Use an extremely mild exfoliator in order to expose fresh skin and allow products to absorb. This will maximize the effectiveness of your skin care products. A moisture-enhancing mask that you put on and wipe off will moisturize and plump skin that may be dry and dehydrated. 
Product Recommendations: 
Makeup remover 
Cleanser, mild or cream based 
Toner (low or no alcohol)
Morning moisturizer with SPF
Evening moisturizer 
Eye moisturizer 
Serum
Mild exfoliant

Why Cleanse?
When you cleanse your face, you can help control the clarity, suppleness and condition of your skin. Cleansing rids your skin of excess facial oil, dust, bacteria, dirt and dead skin cells. This process helps keep the pores unclogged, improves circulation, and prepares your skin for the next step in your cleansing ritual. Quite possibly the most fundamental step in the beauty routine, cleansing is integral to maintaining a balanced complexion. 

Cleansing is recommended twice per day for most skin types, once in the morning and once in the evening. Any more than that, the natural oils become stripped, while any less and your skin can become susceptible to congestion and eruptions.
How to Choose a Cleanser
Choose a cleanser that is appropriate for your skin and is specifically formulated for the face. Dry skin types will need to use a creamy based cleanser, while oilier types will need a gel based or foaming type cleanser. Sensitive skin needs a fragrance-free formulation, most likely labeled as gentle and non-irritating. 
How to Cleanse
Tie your hair back with a headband or ponytail holder. Make sure to start with clean hands. Splash your face with warm or tepid water to open up your pores. Never use too hot or too cold water. Too hot and your skin can dry out, while water that is too cold will not remove the surface oils sufficiently. You can use a washcloth, sponge, exfoliation puff, facial brush or your fingers for cleansing - It all depends on your preference. 

Use approximately a dime to nickel sized amount of cleanser, follow product packaging instructions. You can apply the cleanser with your fingertips or washcloth. Depending on the cleanser type, you might want to work up a lather in your hands first. 

Use gentle upward circular strokes moving around the face, paying attention to the crevices of the nose area and hair line while extending down your neck and around the ear area. Take extra care to use a gentle touch around the eyes. Do not over-scrub or scrub too hard, as your facial skin is susceptible to become easily irritated. 

Once the cleansing is completed, rinse liberally with tepid water. Make sure all areas are rinsed including the neck, hairline and eye area. Cool water may be used, as it helps to close the pores. Finish by blotting your face gently with a towel using a patting technique.
