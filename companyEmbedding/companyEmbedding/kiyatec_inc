Cancer Care by KIYATEC

Home Complementary Diagnostics Cancer Care by KIYATEC 








The Future of Cancer Care
KIYATEC’s goal is to deliver more accurate predictions of patient response to drugs and biologics. We are fulfilling this mission by applying 3D cell-based phenotypic models of cancer with more physiologically relevant tumor microenvironments. By using the patient’s own living tumor cells, these novel diagnostics will serve to better inform clinicians of the best therapeutic candidate to treat that patient’s cancer.
Research efforts have demonstrated our system’s ability to maintain viable 3D tumor tissue in the lab. Additional development efforts have translated laboratory protocols into KIYATEC’s personalized cancer diagnostic currently applied in the second of two blinded biology pilot studies using clinically-derived patient biopsies under IRB approval. These clinically-oriented studies culture the biopsy derived tumor tissue and assess its response to an array of chemotherapy and targeted agents.
The future of cancer care requires advanced diagnostics to assist physicians in actively selecting the most effective therapeutic for each and every patient. Accurate in vitro modeling of an individual’s disease-state requires a degree of complexity that involves multiple cell types and interactions that is currently unmet by traditional “Petri Dish” two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. As a demonstration of this fact, a 2010 study conducted by researchers at Stanford University showed that traditional 2D cell culture models had a 0.0 correlation with the human condition while 3D cell culture models represented a higher human correlation than even mouse models1. This evidence supports KIYATEC’s opportunity to use advanced 3D cell culture techniques in evaluating patient drug response in a personalized fashion.

The KIYATEC Advantage

Home Drug Response Profiling The KIYATEC Advantage 








Drug Response Profiling Services 
KIYATEC offers cell-based Drug Response Profiling (DRP) services to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies accelerate the development of their small molecule compounds and biologic drugs. Our scientific team routinely performs advanced three-dimensional (3D) cell-based assays using immortalized cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tissues or clinically sourced primary cancer tissues, including rare tumors, to better predict in vivo response.  Our 3D tumor models are being used to identify in vitro drug response across a broad array of therapeutic classes and biological targets.  Current funded programs and client projects include:

3D perfusion co-culture models for breast cancer, lung cancers (NSCLC and SCLC) and GBM
3D cell culture models for ovarian and pancreatic cancers
3D cell culture models for rare tumors
Ex Vivo 3D PDX comparison studies

The KIYATEC Paradigm
We seek to maximize the clinical relevance of our preclinical services.  KIYATEC personnel work closely with your scientific staff to understand your company’s drug development process, targets of interest and critical genotypic or phenotypic markers.  We then customize a clinically relevant in vitro  3D microphysiologic model to your drug development needs.  KIYATEC scientists are experts in the use and incorporation of multiple cell types to create highly organized in vivo-like microenvironments coupled with media perfusion.  Since 2014, KIYATEC has focused significant efforts upon creating patient-matched immuno-oncology models comprised of human immune components (including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T-Cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and primary human tumors.
KIYATEC’s in vivo­-like microenvironments closely mimic a patient’s tumor, liver, adipose tissue, stroma and vasculature.  Accordingly, this type of 3D cell-based screening approach enables companies to better understand the phenotypic response of a particular tissue to both small molecule and biologic drugs.  Whether you are investigating tumor-stromal interactions, drug resistance mechanisms, autocrine-paracrine-endocrine stimulation or ligand-receptor signaling, our scientists are experts at developing and testing physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments to assess drug response.
The key differentiator of KIYATEC is our ability to provide customers with highly relevant, predictive drug response profiles (DRPs) for both acute and chronic dosing strategies for the precise tissues and targets of interest in an in vitro assay platform.  Our 3D perfusion culture technologies enable drug developers to identify critical changes in cellular morphology, functionality and phenotypic response in complex tissue-like microenvironments and 3D tumor models.

KIYATEC AND MAYO CLINIC COLLABORATE TO FIGHT OVARIAN CANCER
Collaboration aims to validate the accuracy ex vivo 3D (EV3D) cell culture predictions against ovarian cancer patient outcomes
Greenville, S.C. | June 16, 2016 07:00 EDT – KIYATEC, a leader in emerging 3D ex vivo predictive cancer diagnostics, today announced a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to combine their complementary technology platforms for ovarian cancer clinical care.
Mayo Clinic is actively enrolling patients in a clinical study led by principal investigator John Weroha, M.D., in which patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generate living tumor samples specific to each enrolled ovarian cancer patient. The study assesses whether those samples can help determine which chemotherapy is most effective to treat that individual ovarian cancer patient should they become platinum resistant. A limitation of any PDX model is that it typically takes six to nine months before data is produced.  For some patients that don’t respond at all to the initial treatment information is needed in just a few weeks, a challenge inherent to any clinical study of this sort – until now.
KIYATEC similarly uses living tumor samples specific to each ovarian cancer patient in its active research study with Greenville Health System (GHS), the first healthcare provider to partner with KIYATEC on this research.  The difference is that KIYATEC uses its 3D cell culture platform to generate patient specific drug response prediction data in just 7 days.  If the research collaboration is successful, KIYATEC’s technology would complement the Mayo approach and allow for more patients to be treated according to personalized drug response models.
 “This significantly advances KIYATEC’s goal to validate the accuracy of our cell culture predictions against patient outcomes, the gold standard for these kinds of comparisons,” said Hal Crosswell, M.D., KIYATEC’s Chief Medical Officer.
About KIYATEC
KIYATEC’s mission is to accurately predict patient response to cancer drugs using their living tumor cells in 3D culture, and to use those predictions to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs and increase success in drug development and clinical trials.  The company creates and utilizes live phenotypic 3D cell-based models for drug response profiling and applies them to generate information relevant to preclinical testing, clinical trials and clinical cancer diagnostic applications.

National Cancer Institute (NCI) Awards KIYATEC $1.725M to Develop Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) Expansion Technology 
Contract Funds 3D Cell Culture Technology Platform to Expand CSCs for Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Model Development
GREENVILLE, SC | October 22, 2015 – KIYATEC announced today the award of a Fast Track Phase I and Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Contract for $1.725M from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the 27 institutes and centers that comprise the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The overall goal of the contract is to develop culture systems which can grow and maintain the rare population of malignant cells referred to by some as cancer stem cells, which are believed to lead to therapy resistance, relapse and death from metastatic disease.  KIYATEC’s focus is small cell lung cancer (SCLC), one of the deadliest forms of cancer today with little advancement in treatments in 4 decades.
