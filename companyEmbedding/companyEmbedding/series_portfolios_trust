Exchange-Traded Funds

                Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in worldwide markets. ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day. ETFs combine the characteristics of a mutual fund with the convenience and trading flexibility of stocks. ETFs offer investors the potential advantages of low operating costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Investors' units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. 








 Principal Investment Strategy


Under normal circumstances, the Trust invests at least 80% of the value of its assets in equity securities of United States exchange-listed companies. The U.S.-listed equity securities held by the Trust may include equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The Trust may invest in equity securities issued by small-, mid-, and large-capitalization companies. As a result of the strategy, the Trust invests significantly in the consumer products sector.
Interest rates have been at historic lows for an extended period of time and the Sponsor believes that these historically low interest rates are likely to rise. The Trust seeks to provide a portfolio that is defensive against rising interest rates. The Trust’s strategy is designed to provide a diversified portfolio of equity securities that the Sponsor expects to perform well in an environment of rising interest rates, as measured by movements in the U.S. 10-year treasury bond. The Sponsor defines a rising rate environment as a period in which the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield rises by 150 basis points or more from a prior low value. The prior low value must have been proceeded by a decline in the yield by at least the same amount (i.e., 150 basis points). The start of the rising rate period is the low value before the 150 basis points or greater rise in the yield. The end of the rising rate period is the highest level of the yield that was observed prior to a subsequent decline of at least 150 basis points from that high level. The Trust is not directly intended to provide investors with increasing amounts of dividend income, rising interest income distributions or interest distributions that increase as prevailing interest rates rise.
The Sponsor has sought the assistance of Ned Davis Research, Inc. (“NDR”), as portfolio consultant, to develop the Trust’s investment strategy. NDR evaluates companies based on their sensitivity to key factors identified as having positive correlations of returns in rising interest rate environments.







 Selection Criteria


To select the portfolio, the Sponsor follows a disciplined process developed with NDR that includes both quantitative screening and qualitative analysis. The portfolio selection process begins with the following universe of companies as of the date of the security selection:
• Only companies that have one or more common stock issues are considered.
• Only companies that have one or more stocks trading on NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX stock exchanges are considered.
• Companies that are incorporated in the United States or its territories are eligible. Depository receipts issues are not. Foreign issues that trade directly on U.S. exchanges and are based in a U.S. territory are eligible.
NDR then selects the securities for the portfolio that it believes possess the potential to have a positive correlation to rising interest rates by applying the following series of screens, which NDR has determined have historically produced a portfolio that outperforms the benchmark during periods of rising interest rates. However, prior performance is not indicative of future results. These screens include:
• Earnings Revision. A higher score indicates an upward revision, which signals an improved analyst outlook for the stock going forward.
• Raw Materials Sensitivity. A higher score indicates a stronger relationship with the upward movement of commodity prices, which are generally influenced positively by an improving economy and rising rates.
• Earnings Retention Rate. Measures the percentage of current earnings retained by the company. A higher score indicates a higher rate of retained earnings, and a lower need to take on debt in a rising rate environment.
• Cyclical vs. Consumer Sensitivity. A higher number is preferred when cyclical stocks are expected to outperform consumer stocks, generally associated with an improving economy.
• EBITDA/Enterprise Value. A higher EBITDA/Enterprise Value signifies that each unit of a stock's value is used to generate more EBITDA profits, which normally leads to higher stock returns.
The stocks with the highest rankings are then selected and equal-weighted within the portfolio at the time of selection.







 Risks and Other Considerations


As with all investments, you may lose some or all of your investment in the Trust. No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these:
• Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales of securities by the Trust, government policies, litigation, and changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the securities’ issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
• The Trust invests significantly in the consumer products sector. As a result, the factors that impact the consumer products sector will likely have a greater effect on this Trust than on a more broadly diversified Trust. General risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. A weak economy and its effect on consumer spending would adversely affect companies in the consumer products sector. 4 Investment Summary
• The Trust invests in securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies.T These securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of large-capitalization companies. Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments.
• Share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the Trust may decline during the life of the Trust. There is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the Trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and, if declared, whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
• Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments.
• The Sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The Trust will generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to buy, the same securities even though a security’s outlook, market value or yield may have changed. See “Investment Risks” in Part A of the prospectus and “Risk Factors” in Part B of the prospectus for additional information.

Please see the Trust prospectus for more complete risk information.
Unit Investment Trusts are fixed, not actively managed and should be considered as part of a long-term strategy. Investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available, at the applicable sales charge. UITs are subject to annual fund operating expenses in addition to the sales charge. Investors should consult an attorney or tax advisor regarding tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next, if available, and with the purchase or sale of units.

   The First Estimate for Q2 Real GDP Growth is 2.6% at an Annual Rate



Posted Under: Data Watch • GDP


 Implications:  Nothing in today's GDP report, which includes our first look at economic growth in the second quarter as well as quarterly revisions dating back to 2014, alters our view that the economy remains a Plow Horse.  Real GDP grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the second quarter of the year, not much different from the average growth rate of 2.1% dating back to the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009.  The best news in today's report was that for the second straight quarter, we had an increase in each major part of business investment – investment in equipment, commercial construction, and intellectual property.  That change signals greater business optimism about the future and, if it's sustained, will translate into faster measured productivity growth and economic growth in the next few years.  We like to follow "core" real GDP, which excludes inventories, international trade, and government purchases, none of which can generate long-term economic growth.  Core real GDP grew at a solid 2.7% annual pace in Q2, and that includes a drop in home building at a 6.8% rate that's likely to reverse in the quarters to come, given strong fundamentals in that sector.  In the past year, core GDP is up 2.8%.  In terms of the Federal Reserve, nothing in today's report should alter the likely path of monetary policy over the next year or so.  Nominal GDP (real GDP growth plus inflation) rose at a 3.6% annual rate in Q2, is up 3.7% in the past year, and up at a 3.1% annual rate in the past two years.  All of these figures suggest short-term interest rates should be higher than the roughly 1% where they are today.  Look for the Fed to stay on the path to raising rates again by December and initiating reductions to the size of the balance sheet at the next meeting in late September.  Although investors have their doubts about another rate hike later this year, we think those doubts will recede in the next couple of months.  Slow inventory investment has been holding back the economy in the first half of 2017.  We expect inventories to grow in the second half and for real GDP to grow faster as well.  It's early, but right now we're penciling in a real GDP growth rate of 3%+ in the second half.

 Implications:  Durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in June, as Boeing had a surge in orders for new commercial aircraft.  Still, take out orders from the consistently volatile transportation sector, and orders rose 0.2% in June.  That was below what the consensus was expecting but upward revisions to May, when added to the June gain, shows ex-transportation orders up 0.5%.  In the past year, orders ex-transportation are up 6.8%, the largest gain since 2012.  The best news in today's report was for shipments of non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft, or "core" shipments.  These rose 0.2% in June and revised upward for May.  As a result, these orders were up at a 4.2% annual rate in Q2 versus the Q1 average, representing the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth following near constant declines from late 2014 to late 2016.  In part, this reflects the fact that energy prices have been more stable since the huge decline in late 2014.  However, it also likely reflects the willingness of businesses to invest more aggressively for efficiency purposes as the labor market gets tighter.  It looks like companies may be tired of waiting for Washington to make progress on tax reform and other issues, and starting to commit to significant longer-term decisions.  In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims rose 10,000 last week to 244,000, which is also the four-week moving average.  Meanwhile continuing claims declined 13,000 to 1.96 million.  It's still early – we will update our models next week as we get more claims data plus the ADP report – but plugging today's figures into our models suggests payrolls are up about 175,000 in July.

   The Road to Normal Starts in September



Posted Under: Government • Fed Reserve • Interest Rates


 The Federal Reserve made no changes to interest rates today and made almost no changes to the text of its statement.  However, the wording changes it did make strongly support our view the Fed will announce the start of balance sheet reductions at the end of its next meeting on September 20.
First, the Fed qualified its reference to maintaining its current policy of rolling over principal payments by saying this was the policy only for the "time being."  
Second, at the last meeting in June, the Fed said renormalization would start "this year."  Now it says "relatively soon," the same language Fed Chief Yellen used at the press conference (but not the Fed's official statement) back in June.   
Third, back in June the Fed said it "currently" expected to start renormalizing the balance sheet.  That left the Fed wiggle room to change its own expectation, as if it anticipated the possibility of making a change to its timing.  Now, by removing "currently," the Fed is essentially saying the likelihood of changing its mind is much lower.
Put it all together and it looks like an announcement about renormalization is very likely to happen at the next meeting.  Moreover, there were no dissents at all from today's statement, unlike in June, when Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari made a dovish dissent.      
We expect the Fed's September announcement about renormalization to follow the path suggested in June.   For the first three months (presumably, October – December) the Fed will reduce its balance sheet by $10 billion per month ($6 billion in Treasury securities, $4 billion in mortgage-related securities).  Then, every three months, the amount of monthly balance sheet reduction will rise by $10 billion (with the same 60/40 proportion between Treasury securities and mortgage-related securities).  That escalation will continue until the Fed is cutting its balance sheet by $50 billion per month (presumably in the last quarter of 2018).  
Meanwhile, the Fed softened language surrounding inflation expectations, but made it clear they still anticipate inflation moving towards their 2% inflation target over the medium term. Given the continued improvements in the labor market and consistent – if modest - inflation, we still anticipate the Fed will raise rates once more in 2017. That may change as markets react to the balance sheet normalization process and additional economic data, but, unlike many in the market, we place the odds of a December rate hike at well over 50%.
While others fret about renormalization and rising rates damaging the economy or financial markets, investors should remain bullish.  Look for faster economic growth and a continuation of the bull market in equities in the years ahead.

   New Single-Family Home Sales Rose 0.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  The trend in new home sales remains upward.  Sales rose 0.8% in June and are up a healthy 9.1% from a year ago.  Although the inventory of unsold new homes rose 3,000 in June, that's not a sign of overbuilding or a reason to be concerned.  The months' supply of new homes – how long it would take to sell all the homes in inventory – is 5.4 months.  By contrast, the average over the past decade is 6.7 months, the average over the past 20 years is 5.6 months.  Moreover, 76% of the current inventory is made up of homes where construction either hasn't started yet or is still underway, meaning these aren't completed homes sitting unsold that will create a headwind for future construction. There are a few key reasons for our positive outlook on housing.  First, job gains continue, which should put continued upward pressure on wage growth.  Second, credit standards in the mortgage market are thawing.  Third, the homeownership rate remains depressed as a larger share of the population is renting, leaving plenty of potential buyers as economic conditions continue to improve.  Look for the upward trend in new home sales to continue in the next few years, which means more room for construction and inventories as well.  On the home price front, the national Case-Shiller index increased 0.2% in May and is up 5.6% in the past year.  That's an acceleration from the 5.0% gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Meanwhile, the FHFA index, which measures prices for homes financed with conforming mortgages, increased 0.4% in May and is up 6.9% in the past year, an acceleration from the 5.9% price gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Faster price gains and more rapid acceleration in the FHFA index are likely due to stricter limits on building middle- and lower-end housing.  Regulations add to the fixed cost of housing, which are easier to absorb on higher priced homes.  On the manufacturing front, the Richmond Fed index, which measures mid-Atlantic factory sentiment, increased to +14 in July from +11 in June.  The +14 for July is the highest for any July since the late 1990s and signals continued health in manufacturing.

   Existing Home Sales Declined 1.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  Existing home sales took a breather in June, giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month.  Sales of previously-owned homes fell 1.8% in June to a 5.52 million annual rate, but are still up 0.7% from a year ago.  Going forward, it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month, but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going.  That being said, tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds.  Inventories have now fallen on a year-over-year basis for 25 consecutive months and are down 7.1% from a year ago.  Inventories are now the lowest for any June since at least the late 1990s.  This has also affected the months' supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was 4.3 months in June, down from 4.6 months a year ago.  According to the NAR, anything less than 5.0 months is considered tight supply, a benchmark which hasn't been exceeded since November 2015.  The good news is that demand for existing homes in June was so strong that 54% of listings were on the market for less than a month.  Higher demand and a shift in the "mix" of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices, which have now risen for 64 consecutive months on a year-over-year basis, and reached a new record high in June.  The strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes, signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market.  Tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing, tilting development toward higher-end homes.  The NAR suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices.  Although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, it's important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards, incomes are growing, and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again.

   Moderate Growth for Q2






Since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1%.  The second quarter of this year doesn't look much different.  Our calculations suggest real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in Q2, exactly the same as the consensus forecast.
That's an acceleration from the 1.4% pace in Q1 and we expect better growth ahead. But consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from Washington, DC.  Instead, it's going to take some concrete steps, like less regulation, lower tax rates, less spending, and a more free-market approach to health care.        
Here's how we get to 2.5% for Q2.
Consumption:  Automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a 12.3% annual rate in Q2.  "Real" (inflation-adjusted) retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a 1.2% rate, but growth in services was strong, in part due to a rebound in (seasonally-adjusted) utility output after unusually mild weather in January and February.  Our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services, combined, grew at a 2.9% annual rate in Q2, contributing 2.0 points to the real GDP growth rate (2.9 times the consumption share of GDP, which is 69%, equals 2.0).
Business Investment:  After clicking on all cylinders in Q1, business investment grew more modestly in Q2.  Investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a 4% rate, but commercial construction fell at about a 7% pace.  Combined, it looks like they grew at a 1.7% rate, which should add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth.  (1.7 times the 13% business investment share of GDP equals 0.2).
Home Building:  While boosting utilities in Q2, the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction.  Home building looks like it grew in Q2, but at a 2.5% annualized pace rather than the 12.9% pace in Q1.  The trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise, as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing.  In the meantime, a 2.5% growth rate will add 0.1 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (2.5 times the home building share of GDP, which is 4%, equals 0.1).
Government:  Both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in Q2.  On net, we're estimating that real government purchases were up at a 1.4% annual rate in Q2, which would add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (1.4 times the government purchase share of GDP, which is 17%, equals 0.2).
Trade:  At this point, we only have trade data through May.  Based on what we've seen so far, it looks like net exports should subtract 0.3 points from the real GDP growth rate in Q2.   
Inventories:  We have even less information on inventories than we do on trade, but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than they were in Q1, which should add 0.3 points to the real GDP growth rate.
Keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the GDP release and those figures could change our forecast as well.  But, for the time being, you can put it all together, and get an estimate of 2.5% for Q2.  
No one should be excited or dismayed by this report.  It is the epitome of the Plow Horse pace of growth we've had for the past eight years.   Hopefully, Washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last Plow Horse reports we have to see.

   Housing Starts Increased 8.3% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Starts • Housing


 Implications:  After falling for three consecutive months, housing starts rebounded strongly in June, beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year.  Even though both single-family and multi-unit starts were responsible for the gain in June's headline number, in the past year single-family starts are up 10.3% while multi-unit starts are down 12.9%.  The "mix" of construction has been generally shifting toward single-family building and this is a good sign for the overall economy.  When the housing recovery started, multi-family construction led the way. But the share of all housing starts that are multi-family appears to have peaked in 2015, when 35.7% of all starts were multi-family, the largest since the mid-1980s, when the last wave of Baby Boomers was growing up and moving to cities. In June, the multi-family share of starts was 30.1%.  The shift toward single-family is a positive sign for the economy because, on average, each single-family home contributes to GDP about twice the amount of a multi-family unit.  Based on population growth and "scrappage," housing starts should eventually rise to about 1.5 million units per year. In other words, much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us.  Another bright spot in today's report was that housing completions rose 5.2% in June and are now up 8.1% in the past year.  Further, building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since 2015 in June.  Expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones.  In other recent housing news, the NAHB index, which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated 64 in July from 67 in June.  Expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs, faster wage growth, and, for at least the time being, optimism about more market-friendly policies from the Trump Administration, continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders.  On the factory front, the Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing sentiment in New York, fell to a still healthy 9.8 in July from 19.8 in June. Finally, on inflation, import prices fell 0.2% in June but are up 1.5% from a year ago.  Export prices also fell 0.2% in June, but have increased 0.6% in the past year.  Both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in June 2016.

As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

Multiple Series Trusts


























Multiple Series Trusts
Reduce your funds launch time and lower start-up costs by utilizing our Multiple Series Trust comprehensive service solution and expertise.
We have the qualified professionals and complete service solution necessary to manage a Multiple Series Trust (MST). Advisers with limited assets under management, such as start-ups, often utilize adding a fund to an existing MST. However, these types of funds are becoming viable options for large managers launching mutual funds. Our MSTs allow advisers to capitalize on the strength of their investment strategies and stay focused on raising and managing assets.
Our turn-key solution reduces the legal work necessary by adding your fund to an existing trust, essentially lowering the costs compared to establishing an entirely new fund. Additionally, all MSTs at U.S. Bancorp Fund Services include a dedicated and qualified CCO who acts as a daily resource to the advisers’ CCOs and provides assessment, guidance, and consulting, further reducing your costs and time to market. By leveraging our team of experts, you can avoid the operational and regulatory complexities of starting a traditional mutual fund and continue to focus on growing your fund. Our goal is to ensure you are provided an operational structure with customized services, financial reporting, and complete support and industry guidance.








Multiple Series Trusts offer several advantages, including

Reduced time to market
Lower start-up costs due to the reduced amount of legal review
Governance and service expertise of an existing board
A dedicated CCO for all funds within the trust
Sarbanes-Oxley monitoring and certification for all fund financial reporting
Administrative efficiencies

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        May 24, 2017.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice.
Start Printed Page 25037
Notice of an application under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”) for an exemption from section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act, as well as from certain disclosure requirements in rule 20a-1 under the Act, Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A, Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X (“Disclosure Requirements”). The requested exemption would permit an investment adviser to hire and replace certain subadvisers without shareholder approval and grant relief from the Disclosure Requirements as they relate to fees paid to the subadvisers.

Applicants: Series Portfolios Trust (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company, and Highmore Group Advisors, LLC (the “Initial Adviser”), a New York limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (collectively with the Trust, the “Applicants”).

Filing Dates: The application was filed on November 28, 2016 and amended on April 18, 2017 and May 11, 2017.

Hearing or Notification of Hearing: An order granting the application will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on June 19, 2017, and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.
ADDRESSES:
Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: Alia M. Vasquez, Esq., Series Portfolios Trust, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, WI 53202; Dr. Brian M. Altenburg, Highmore Group Advisors, LLC, 120 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10011.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

End Preamble
Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. The Adviser will serve as the investment adviser to the Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Trust (the “Advisory Agreement”).[1] 
           The Adviser will provide the Funds with continuous and comprehensive investment management services, subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, each Fund's board of trustees (“Board”). The Advisory Agreement permits the Adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, to delegate to one or more subadvisers (each, a “Subadviser” and collectively, the “Subadvisers”) the responsibility to provide the day-to-day portfolio investment management of each Fund, subject to the supervision and direction of the Adviser. The primary responsibility for managing the Funds will remain vested in the Adviser. The Adviser will hire, evaluate, allocate assets to and oversee the Subadvisers, including determining whether a Subadviser should be terminated, at all times subject to the authority of the Board.
2. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to hire certain Subadvisers pursuant to subadvisory agreements and materially amend existing subadvisory agreements without obtaining the shareholder approval required under section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.[2] 
           Applicants also seek an exemption from the Disclosure Requirements to permit a Fund to disclose (as both a dollar amount and a percentage of the Fund's net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Subadviser; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Subadvisers other than Affiliated Subadvisers. For any Fund that employs an Affiliated Subadviser, the Fund will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Subadviser.
3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application. Such terms and conditions provide for, among other safeguards, appropriate disclosure to Fund shareholders and notification about subadvisory changes and enhanced Board oversight to protect the interests of the Funds' shareholders.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or any rule thereunder, if such relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets this standard because, as further explained in the application, the Advisory Agreements will remain subject to shareholder approval while the role of the Subadvisers is substantially similar to that of individual portfolio managers, so that requiring shareholder approval of subadvisory agreements would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Funds. Applicants believe that the requested relief from the Disclosure Requirements meets this standard because it will improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate fees paid to the Subadvisers that are more advantageous for the Funds.

Footnotes

1.
     Applicants request relief with respect to any existing or future series of the Trust or any other registered open-end management company that: (a) Is advised by the Initial Adviser, or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Initial Adviser or its successor (each, an “Adviser”); (b) uses the manager of managers structure described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (any such series, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”). For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.

2.
     The requested relief will not extend to any subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trust, a Fund, or the Adviser, other than solely by reason of serving as a Subadviser to one or more of the Funds, or as an adviser or subadviser to any series of the Trust other than the Funds (“Affiliated Subadviser”).

Series Trust Services




The Investment Managers Series Trusts provide a simple, cost-efficient means of starting and operating a mutual fund - ideal for advisors who wish to offer a mutual fund to enhance their product line.
UMB Fund Services and Mutual Fund Administration, LLC (MFAC) co-sponsor two series trusts. The Investment Managers Series Trust II was established in 2013 due to the success of the original trust and is currently open to new advisors.
The Investment Managers Series Trusts combine UMB’s experience as a fund service provider with the specialized expertise of MFAC in fund formation and series trust administration.
UMB acts as lead service provider, serving as fund accountant, transfer agent and custodian* as well as co-administrator with MFAC.
MFAC takes the lead on general fund oversight, post-trade compliance, handling board and Chief Compliance Officer matters/communication, corporate secretarial services, regulatory compliance, Securities and Exchange Commission registration/reporting, and budgeting.






Benefits and Highlights

Lower overhead due to sharing a board of trustees, fund officers, a CCO, etc.
Shorter start-up time (roughly half the time needed to start an independent fund)
Lower fund break-even points than an independent fund
Board of trustees, fund auditors, legal counsel and other service providers are already in place
A vehicle for multiple types of accounts – retirement accounts, 401(k)s, etc.
Each fund maintains its own branding/identity
Allows advisors to focus their efforts on managing money and growing assets


Key Services

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.
