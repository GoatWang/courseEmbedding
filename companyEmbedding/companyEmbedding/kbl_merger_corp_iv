Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

NEWARK, Del., June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KBL Merger Corp. IV (the "Company"), a blank check company led by Marlene Krauss, M.D., announced today the closing of its initial public offering of 10,000,000 units. The offering was priced at $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $100,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.








The Company's units began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market ("NASDAQ") under the ticker symbol "KBLMU" on June 2, 2017. Each unit consists of one share of the Company's common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock upon the consummation of the Company's initial business combination, and one warrant exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share). Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock, rights and warrants are expected to be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols "KBLM," "KBLMR" and "KBLMW," respectively.
KBL Merger Corp. IV was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company intends to focus its search for a target business in the healthcare and related wellness industry.
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., a subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE MKT: LTS), B. Riley & Co. and FBR acted as joint book-running managers, Chardan acted as lead manager and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. acted as co-manager for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.
Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP acted as counsel to the Company and Holland & Knight LLP acted as counsel to the underwriters.
The public offering was made only by means of a prospectus. Copies of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Attn: Syndicate Department, 277 Park Ave., 26th Floor, New York, NY 10172, telephone number: 1-800-573-2541, e-mail: prospectus@ladenburg.com.
A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 1, 2017. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," including with respect to the initial public offering and the anticipated use of the net proceeds thereof. No assurance can be given that the net proceeds of the offering will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's registration statement and prospectus for the Company's offering filed with the SEC. Copies are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.

NEWARK, Del., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KBL Merger Corp. IV (the "Company") announced today the pricing of its initial public offering of 10,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit. The units will be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market ("NASDAQ") and trade under the ticker symbol "KBLMU" beginning June 2, 2017. Each unit consists of one share of the Company's common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock upon the consummation of the Company's initial business combination, and one warrant exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share). Once the securities comprising the units begin trading separately, the common stock, rights and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols "KBLM," "KBLMR" and "KBLMW," respectively.








KBL Merger Corp. IV was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company intends to focus its search for a target business in the healthcare and related wellness industry.

Riley & Co. and FBR are acting as joint book-running managers, Chardan is acting as lead manager and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. is acting as co-manager for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.
The public offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Attn: Syndicate Department, 277 Park Ave., 26th Floor, New York, NY 10172, telephone number: 1-800-573-2541, e-mail: prospectus@ladenburg.com.
A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 1, 2017. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," including with respect to the proposed initial public offering and the anticipated use of the net proceeds thereof. No assurance can be given that the offering discussed above will be completed on the terms described, or at all, or that the net proceeds of the offering will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the Company's offering filed with the SEC.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of up to $200,000 that we may draw down
    as described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of
    this offering out of the $500,000 of offering proceeds that has been
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, up to $3,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $4,025,000 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less 
    amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account to pay our taxes. Based on the current interest rate environment, we
    would expect approximately $353,500 per year to be available to us from 
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 18 months (or 21
    months, as applicable) following the closing of this offering; however, we
    can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an 
    interest rate of 0.35% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
    which the trust account may be invested.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $101,000,000 (or $116,150,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $3,500,000 (or up
to $4,025,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $353,500 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.35% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes (and $50,000
reserved for liquidation expenses if we do not successfully complete our initial
business combination), until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are
unable to complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering (or 21 months, as applicable) (subject to the requirements of law)
or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with a stockholder
vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation (A) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (or 21 months, as
applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’
rights or pre-business combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $140,000 of up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of June 30, 2017 or
the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans will be convertible into units of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the
holders being issued 110,000 shares of common stock if $1,000,000 of notes were
so converted since the 100,000 rights included in such units would result in the
issuance of 10,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well
as 100,000 warrants to purchase 50,000 shares) at the option of the lender. The
units would be identical to the private placement units. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 18 months (or 21 months, as applicable)
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with
a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (A) that would affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering
(or 21 months, as applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers, directors and the underwriters have entered into letter
agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and
(except for the underwriters) public shares in connection with the completion of
our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor, officers and
directors and the underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and
private placement shares if we fail to complete our business combination within
the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers,
directors or the underwriters or their respective affiliates acquire public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business.

Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public 
stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources
available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding rights
and warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be
viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place
us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business
combination.


Company Description
We are a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
on September 7, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger,
capital stock exchange, stock purchase, asset acquisition or other similar
business combination with one or more operating businesses, which we


 refer
throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We intend to
focus our efforts on acquiring an operating company in the healthcare and
related wellness industry although our efforts in identifying a prospective
target business will not be limited to a particular industry. We have not
identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on
our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with
respect to identifying any business combination target.
