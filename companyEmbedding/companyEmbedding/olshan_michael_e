 Educational Background



Graduate, cum laude 


Harvard University

                  Harvard was established in 1636, and it is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. The University, which is based in Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, has an enrollment of over 20,000 degree candidates, including undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The University has twelve degree-granting Schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.                




Bachelor's Degree in Government, cum laude 


Harvard University - John F. Kennedy School of Government

                  The Women and Public Policy Program of Harvard Kennedy School closes gender gaps in economic opportunity, political participation, health and education by creating knowledge, training leaders and informing public policy and organizational practices.

 

Our research provides evidence-based insights on the role of gender in shaping economic, political and social opportunities available to individuals. We identify successful interventions and measure their impact on women, men, and society, then share recommendations on what policies, organizational practices and leadership techniques help close involuntary gaps.                





 Career History



Co-Founder, Chairman & Managing Partner

                                    2009 - Current                


O-Cap Management LP


                  Founded in 2009, O-Cap Management LP is a hedge fund manager located in New York City                




Co-Manager

                                    2007 - 2009                


OTK Associates LLC






Managing Director

                                    Prior                


JANA Partners LLC


                  JANA Partners primarily employs a long/short “value + catalyst” strategy to identify attractive investment opportunities over the full cycle of market and economic conditions. The firm seeks investments that can be made at discounts to their estimates of intrinsic value as determined by fundamental analysis and where there are one or more identifiable catalysts for recognition of that value within a defined investment timeframe. Such catalysts may include, among other events, a material corporate event (such as a sale of the company, restructuring or recapitalization), a significant change in the business model or a change in management, competitive position, or market recognition. JANA's short strategy typically represents the inverse of their long strategy. Also, in some cases, JANA effects short sales of securities for portfolio balance. Investments span a broad spectrum of industries and geographies, generally focusing on companies with large market capitalizations. Investments include, but aren't necessarily limited to, equity and debt securities of companies, options and other derivatives, and private investments. In certain situations, JANA may seek to bring about change at companies in which they have invested by either working with management to effect change or, where management is unwilling to do so, pursuing a shareholder activist strategy. In addition, a small portion of their strategy is dedicated to trading-driven strategies which may fall outside of their “value + catalyst” strategy, including engaging in opportunistic trading that seeks to capitalize on relative value, price momentum, market dislocations, syndicated offerings and other strategies to identify attractive investment opportunities. JANA Partners often engages in shareholder activism and is included in the SharkWatch50 as one of the most prominent activist investors.
