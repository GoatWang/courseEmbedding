Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays
Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.'s stock  shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp.  fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc.  lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc.  dropped 1.7% after Dahl downgraded them to equal weight from overweight. Shares of KB Home  slipped 0.2%, Meritage Homes Corp.  gave up 0.8% and Realogy Holdings Corp.  lost 0.3% after Dahl reiterated his underweight ratings. "Our June A.G.E.N.T. Survey indicated moderating buyer traffic trends, warning of risk that near-term catalysts for builders will disappoint relative to rising expectations," Dahl wrote in a note to clients. Separately, CalAtlantic Group Inc.'s stock  bucked the sector's trend by rallying 0.8%, after Dahl upgraded it to equal weight from underweight, citing its recent underperformance relative to the group. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF , which was down 0.6% in morning trade, has run up 25% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.4% this year.

Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays
Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.'s stock  shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp.  fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc.  lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc.  dropped 1.7% after Dahl downgraded them to equal weight from overweight. Shares of KB Home  slipped 0.2%, Meritage Homes Corp.  gave up 0.8% and Realogy Holdings Corp.  lost 0.3% after Dahl reiterated his underweight ratings. "Our June A.G.E.N.T. Survey indicated moderating buyer traffic trends, warning of risk that near-term catalysts for builders will disappoint relative to rising expectations," Dahl wrote in a note to clients. Separately, CalAtlantic Group Inc.'s stock  bucked the sector's trend by rallying 0.8%, after Dahl upgraded it to equal weight from underweight, citing its recent underperformance relative to the group. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF , which was down 0.6% in morning trade, has run up 25% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.4% this year.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
