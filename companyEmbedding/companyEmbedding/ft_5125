25 Ft. Magnetic Tape Measure

Enjoy professional results from the Milwaukee® 25 Ft. Magnetic Tape Measure whether you're a contractor or just a handy homeowner. With two magnets on the blade, you can work with one hand free. The best magnetic tape measure anchors the front and bottom of the tape to nearby steel studs and electrical metallic tubing conduit. It also has up to a 9-foot standout. Grab this heavy-duty measuring tool with its five-point reinforced frame if you've lost a few favorites in the past after dropping them from the second or third story of a building. Because of the nylon bonded edges and surface of the blade, there's 10 times less contamination from dust and sticky resins to gum up the retraction mechanism. The Milwaukee magnetic tape measure includes a safety finger stop to protect against injuries from the moving blade. It also includes a blueprint scale to calculate 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch drawings and because its double sided, it's easier to read.

You'd think there's nothing much to say about a tape measure, but this thing is excellent. I really like the finger spot you can use to hold the tape out.

Best tape measure I've ever owned
I work as an hvac installer, and I never found a tape measure that actually helped make my job easier until I bought this one. I do sheet metal work every day, and any tape measure will give me measurements. I don't think Milwaukee intended other uses for the finger stop, but it makes for a phenomenal light metal scribe when cutting metal for duct. The magnet could be stronger, and the belt clip is so tight it's useless, but the two things that make it a joy to use are the tough lock and the bonus of using the finger stop to scribe metal for cutting. I'm tempted to buy extras in case they redesign it and take away my favorite features.

Dropped it 100 ft.
I dropped this tape from the top of a wooden roller coaster and thought for sure I would be collecting broken parts when I went to retrieve it. NOT EVEN A SCRATCH! We spend more on these tape measures because they are worth every penny. They last and last.

25' magnetic tape measure
I really liked the tape, the first one I bought lasted about a year and a half before the blade cracked at 83". I bought another one and in a month the blade broke again at 6".I don't abuse my tools so l won't be spending my money on a third.

Better than any other tape out there
I have had this tape measure for over 4 months now and It works just as well as the day I bought it. It has gotten wet during tile jobs and filled with dust cutting stone and wood. Just pull it out and wipe it down with a rag and it's good to go. I have dropped this tape from two stories without a scratch. It fits into my belt clip on my tool pouches more securely than my old tape, yet it comes off much easier. And finally, being an aesthetics kind of guy, it matches all my other Red tools! Never been more impressed with a tape's durability and ruggedness in my life!
