We  get it! Dealing with safety compliance issues can be a nightmare! With  constant changes to safety standards and your own facility updates, it  seems like a never ending cycle. And to make things worse, OSHA can  impose both civil and criminal penalties on employers who fail to abide  by the legally required safety standards. We know that it is very  important to you and your company to avoid mistakes which can result in  costly fines, injuries, or death. So yes, It’s critical for you to  establish safety guidelines for your employees and visitors. But  Effective communication of these policies is key when fostering a  culture of safety. We know that It’s a trying task to coordinate safety  training for everyone AND you have to Stop pretending that your  receptionist can educate all employees and visitors who enter your facility about the  safety rules for the shop floor or in case of an emergency. So look -  We’ve solved safety communication issues for facilities just like yours.  And we know the Facilities that hold safety records get that general  and generic safety communication tools just don’t work when they don’t  cater to your specific facility. Discover our proven 5 step system that  helps manufacturing facilities stay compliant and systemize custom  safety communications fast and effectively. Gain a peace of mind and  keep everyone in your facility safe by Contacting us today!









Think of that moment you get when seeing something in a video that helps you  understand what pictures and words simply cannot convey.  More  and more, video is becoming the new document in corporate  communications. Video can be an excellent tool for corporate messaging  and I want to talk about why.Why is video such an effective tool when it comes to corporate messaging? Here are three key areas: The Combination of Seeing and Hearing – This might  sound obvious but combining visual and audio interaction has a much  greater impact.  Studies  show that retention rates of information that is both seen and heard is  80% compared with 10% retention for hearing and 20% retention for  seeing. Introducing an Emotional Element – One key aspect of  most company meetings is about safety performance. While everyone wants  the company to comply to safety standards, the details of safety plans and procedures are not always engaging. Sending out an email or doing a conference call  about safety is one thing, but adding a face to those words and  having employees see the excitement (or disappointment) creates an  experience where the employee is more likely to feel a sense of  ownership and responsibility. This is all together what you want to  accomplish, an engaged employee with a strong morale.Easily Update video with new information - Since there are always updates to safety and facility procedures it is very important to use a tool that can be easily and inexpensively updated. With video, you can easily have the outdated footage replaced with the new procedures without going into a brand new production. The Ability to reach your Audience – A video  communication message can be sent anywhere in the world, to any device,  easily and quickly. This allows large diversely located companies to  send effective communications to their employees in a scalable  cost-effective way.


 CREATE CUSTOM CONTENT FOR SAFETY COMMUNICATIONSVague generic safety and health programs will not meet the job-specific requirements of many safety codes.
You've ordered the generic safety videos before. Probably in the 90's. Today those outdated safety films leave so much out. You play the video and then you spend an hour explaining the things that are different in your facility and equipment. Streamline your safety communications and make it right the first time. Your employes will be engaged and entertained when they see your actual location and we can even feature some of your current staff in your custom safety video.

Team - Meet the Media Couple "The Guys"

. 



MARCUS GUY  FOUNDER AND CEO OF ASSET MEDIA GROUP, INC.      Marcus Guy began his professional media career in 1993 on a music   tour  working with event promotions and tour management. There he was    responsible for managing all aspects of event production including venue    and media production planning and execution. He toured the U.S. and    Europe managing production for seven years until he was offered the    opportunity of producing a documentary related to the culture of the    music industry and his experience on the road. One day on the film set,    one of the camera operators was challenged with a shot and Marcus took    the lead. There he was behind the camera and soon became a lead   producer  on the project. This was the spark into his film career. His   knowledge  of media production combined with his new film passion was   proved to be a  combination that produced success as his very first   documentary toured  film festivals and sold nearly a half of a million   copies worldwide. As  his music and entertainment connections gained   knowledge of of his new  passion behind the camera, they began to   solicit his expertise in event  production incorporating videography as   well as live audio and visual  components. For years, he has provided   services for clients such as  Nike, Reebok, LRG, Courvoisier, ACE Cash   Express, and the BET-Centric TV  cable networks. He is highly trusted   knowledgeable of audiovisual  supply and planning as well as the   operation and installation of  audiovisual equipment.

She began her professional career in the sales and marketing   industry  with American Express Financial Group where she honed her   skills as an  effective presenter, marketer and communicator. In 2006   she began  working as an organizational consultant assisting various   large and  local brands with business management and strategic sales and   marketing  planning with teams. For 3 years she has worked with   companies such as  AT&T, Verizon, and Quill where she coached,   trained, and developed  entry-level sales and marketing professionals   into management. This role  also included the task of organizing many   seminars and training  meetings which has helped her with fulfilling the   visions of the clients  she personally assist through Asset Media  Group  today. In 2007, she met  her husband Marcus Guy, who was a  seasoned  media professional and begin  to merge her skills into his  industry. In  2008 the couple met audio  visual professional and graphic  designer  Chris Valcarce while working  with a group of media  professionals for a  local client. His knack for  detail and creativity  was a sure fit for  the team. . By 2009 they could  clearly see the  benefit of collaborating  by offering their shared  expertise to  existing clients. Clients were  so pleased that they could  come to one  source and have all of their  media and production needs met  with such  quality, detail, and  expertise.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for New Media Investment Group (NYSE:NEWM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months.

Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $17.33 (26.43% upside)
