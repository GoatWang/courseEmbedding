Equity










			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Blackstone Enters Nontraded REIT Market With New Fund - Bloomberg






























































  
















Blackstone Enters Nontraded REIT Market With New Fund
By Hui-yong Yu

                Move follows rule changes aimed at reducing conflicts, costs
            



                New REIT to invest in properties with stable rental income
            



Blackstone Group LP is seeking to raise $5 billion for its first nontraded real estate investment trust, targeting individual investors in a market that has been plagued by conflicts of interests, high commissions and poor performance.The move by the world’s biggest alternative-asset manager follows regulatory rule changes aimed at increasing transparency in the industry for nontraded REITs, which aren’t listed on exchanges and are primarily marketed by brokers to individual buyers. The rules include requiring such trusts to follow stricter guidelines on estimating the net asset values of their holdings and disclosing costs.Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust will be a perpetual-life fund and will invest in commercial properties that generate stable rental income, including apartments, shopping centers and hotels, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. The new REIT hasn’t bought any assets yet. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Blackstone, declined to comment beyond the filing.








“Historically, the fee load has been pretty significant for retail investors to get into these vehicles,” said Dirk Aulabaugh, a managing director in the advisory and consulting unit of Green Street Advisors LLC, a Newport Beach, California-based real estate research firm. Blackstone’s new fund appears to be “better aligned than what has historically been the case in the nontraded REIT space, and I think investors are going to welcome that, and they’ll be successful in raising capital along those lines.”‘Large-Scale’The nontraded REIT is Blackstone’s latest push into less-risky real estate investments. The company already has an open-end fund for institutions called Blackstone Property Partners. That fund buys so-called core-plus real estate -- properties that might require light renovation or leasing work to increase values. The core-plus strategy, which includes separately managed accounts for institutional clients, has grown to about $12 billion in assets, Blackstone Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman said in April.“The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” Schwarzman said on the company’s first-quarter earnings conference call, on April 21. “As we move into the retail chain of distribution with this, we should be able to create a really very large-scale business.”




Higher YieldsNontraded REITs have been able to attract investors partly by offering higher dividend yields than publicly traded property owners. More attention was brought to such products in 2014 with the accounting scandal at American Realty Capital Properties Inc. The landlord was part of the real estate empire of Nicholas Schorsch, whose AR Capital LLC was the largest sponsor of nontraded REITs.“The market’s maturing and it is addressing some of the regulatory concerns over increasing the transparency or decreasing the front-end costs associated with these programs,” said Anthony Chereso, president and CEO of the Investment Program Association trade group. “What you’re going to see is a continuing evolution toward a product that’s going to be more broadly received, and you’ll see capital-raising improve as markets adjust to it.”

Sales of nontraded REITs have plunged. They raised $2.79 billion this year through July, down from $6.41 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Robert A. Stanger & Co. The decline followed a 36 percent drop for all of last year, the real estate investment bank said. Nontraded REITs had $90.9 billion of assets under management as of March 31, according to the Investment Program Association, citing figures from the bank.Returns from nontraded REITs generally lagged behind their publicly traded counterparts, shares of which also are easier to buy and sell, Aulabaugh said. Other nontraded REITs are looking at ways to reduce fees, he said. Blackstone’s track record of delivering strong returns in real estate ought to help it raise money for its new REIT, Aulabaugh said.“They’re going to make the business better,” he said. Blackstone’s entry “will force other players in the space to raise their game.”— With assistance by Devin Banerjee(Trade group corrects assets under management in ninth paragraph of story published Aug. 10.)

Blackstone preps nontraded real estate fund for the fee-only crowd
Fund comes with no sales load but 12(b)-1 fee, performance fee and expense ratio






Dec 30, 2013 @ 12:04 pm

	Jason Kephart






















+ Zoom




      Private-equity powerhouse The Blackstone Group Inc. is raising funds for a new nontraded real estate mutual fund designed to appeal to fee-only financial advisers. Blackstone is raising money for the Blackstone Real Estate Income Fund II, which will offer shares that are not subject to a sales load, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sales loads on nontraded real estate investment trusts, which are typically more than 10%, have made the products popular in the independent broker-dealer community, but have also been a major point of criticism from financial adviser channels that are more focused on fees, such as independent registered investment advisers.
				



Instead of a sales load, the Blackstone Real Estate Income Fund II will have an ongoing 12(b)-1 fee of 25 basis points and also have a 1.5% expense ratio and 15% performance fee, similar to a hedge fund. The fund will invest in the usual smorgasbord of real estate investments, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, private real estate debt and loans. Blackstone expects to complete its fundraising by March 31, according to the filing. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment while the fund is in a quiet period. The Blackstone fund is the latest sign of innovation in the booming nontraded real estate fund space. In January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch became the first wirehouse to sell a nontraded REIT through its advisers. The Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust that Merrill chose comes with a 2.5% sales load. Nontraded real estate investment trusts recorded a record $20 billion in sales in 2013, up from $10.3 billion in 2012, and industry watchers expect another strong year of growth in 2014.

Blackstone launches $5B non-traded REIT
New vehicle to focus on low-risk properties



















 August 10, 2016 05:00PM












Stephen Schwarzman (credit: Natalie White)
Blackstone Group launched its first non-traded real estate investment trust and is looking to raise $5 billion from investors.
The new REIT, dubbed Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, will focus on core properties including hotels and multifamily buildings, according to an SEC filing cited by Bloomberg. Blackstone is primarily known as a manager of private investment funds, although it also runs a publicly traded mortgage REIT. The company had $103.2 billion in real estate assets under management as of June 30.
The new REIT appears to be part of Blackstone’s  push into stable, income-producing assets that come with less risk but also offer lower returns. In December, the fund manager bought Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village for $5.3 billion in partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge through a core-plus fund.
“The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on an earnings call in April, speaking of low-risk real estate. “As we move into the retail chain of distribution with this, we should be able to create a really very large-scale business.”

Blackstone Group, the private equity firm that oversees $368.2 billion of investments, has taken the lead in targeting mom-and-pop investors with its first nontraded real estate investment trust, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Nontraded REITs are marketed to people seeking investments in the commercial real estate industry.
As of April, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust Inc. had raised $755.4 million, or about 40 percent of the money raised by nontraded REITs, according to data from investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co.
Nontraded REITs have faced criticism for charging high fees and providing poor disclosure of risks and fees. Investors complained some traditional nontraded REITs didn’t penalize fund managers for making bad investment decisions. That’s not the case for the Blackstone product.
“If things don’t go well, Blackstone won’t make as much,” Phil Owens, managing director of Green Street Advisors’ consulting unit, told the WSJ. “If things go really well, they make more.”
Green Street historically has recommended that investors buy traded REITs, which are listed on public stock exchanges, because of their better fee structure.
Nontraded REITs were popular used to be popular because of the high dividends they paid when interest rates were near historic lows. But upfront fees that be as much as 15 percent and negative headlines about the collapse of American Realty Capital Partners Inc. damped enthusiasm for the investment products.
Blackstone is marketing its nontraded REIT through major financial groups such as UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch brokerage.
Blackstone this week also disclosed plans to raise $40 billion for an infrastructure fund. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund agreed to commit $20 billion to the pool, which may have more than $100 billion of purchasing power when adding debt.
Blackstone was co-founded by Steven Schwarzman, who is chairman of President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy forum made up of business leaders who advise the White House on jobs and growth.

			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
