FMR LLC is pleased to provide you with the information, content, tools, products and services on all Fidelity Sites (the term "Fidelity Sites" refers to all Fidelity web sites, as well as to the content on them). Because these Terms of Use cover multiple web sites, some terms may refer to items that are available only on certain Fidelity sites. These Terms of Use also include some important disclosures and information related to certain products and services. Your use of Fidelity Sites is subject to these Terms of Use ("Terms"). There are many different Fidelity companies ("Fidelity Entities"), and their affiliates, that provide information, content, tools, products and services on and through the Fidelity Sites.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.
The following investments and brokerage products and services are offered through Fidelity Sites by the Fidelity Entity indicated. These four Fidelity Entities are also broker-dealers:

Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through the following Fidelity Investments companies: Strategic Advisers, Inc., Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB ("FPTC"), a federal savings bank, or Fidelity Management Trust Company ("FMTC"). Non-deposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and FMTC and their affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.
Persons outside of the United States should visit Fidelity Institutional, which will direct them to the appropriate overseas web site of Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates. Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates, Fidelity Worldwide Investments (FIL Limited), Fidelity Investments Canada Limited, Fidelity Investments Management (H.K.) Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.
 
 Copyright policy, linking policy and trademarks

Unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise, links from another web site to a Fidelity Site must resolve to the top-level homepage of a Fidelity domain (e.g., www.fidelity.com, www.netbenefits.com). In order to avoid confusion if you do link from another web site to a Fidelity Site top-level homepage, your web site, and the link itself, may not suggest that Fidelity endorses, sponsors or is affiliated with any non-Fidelity web site, entity, service or product, and may not make use of any Fidelity trademarks or service marks other than those contained within the text of the link.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
