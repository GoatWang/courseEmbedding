 Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. (stock symbol – MIHI) is a publically traded company focused on reducing the costs of health care while simultaneously increasing quality of care, improving access to health services for millions, and monetizing assets to bring value to shareholders. MIHI is building a comprehensive telemedicine platform to bring unparalleled access to top-quality healthcare, in real time, to anyone who needs it.
Organized in Colorado, Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. is a conglomerate of companies built around the central theme of delivering quality health care to medically underserved areas. MIHI will bring about its strategic plan for delivering unparalleled access to real-time care through its subsidiaries: 3PointCare and BKare Diagnostics.
3PointCare implements, manages, and supports the delivery of personalized virtual health encounters (i.e. telehealth). Its primary role is to support TeleLifeMD, a multi-disciplinary specialty health care practice with strong experience in telemedicine services. By providing administrative support that ranges from claims processing to software rollout, 3PointCare removes these burdens from TeleLifeMD so that its administration can focus on delivering world-class health care.
BKare is the products and services arm of MIHI and is tasked with delivering medical and health-related services other than medical consults. Offerings, such as laboratory testing and diagnostic services, are designed to support remote health care encounters. BKare also develops remote monitoring services and medical devices that can enhance patient well-being, prevent chronic disease, and enable telehealth providers to monitor patients and their conditions in real time from remote locations.
MIHI firmly believes that the best way to provide access to high-quality medical care is through support and delivery of evidence-based virtual medicine (a.k.a. telemedicine). To that end, MIHI is working to develop software and professional services that allow providers to track not only patient well-being, but the success of their interventions through their own personal care metrics. MIHI makes it possible for its providers to understand the care that they deliver so that they can work to transform the health care industry from the ground up.
Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. is applying cutting-edge technology and time-tested business practices to the health care industry to improve the quality of care delivered to patients. Telemedicine offers the perfect data-rich environment through which to tackle the challenges facing modern health care. By fulfilling its responsibility to deliver world-class health care to all of its patients, MIHI is simultaneously fulfilling its promise to deliver value to its shareholders who are as much a part of the revolution in health care as MIHI and its subsidiaries.

 Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. (stock symbol MIHI) is in the business of delivering a nationwide, state-by-state, multidisciplinary medical specialist provider network. We bring top-quality medical care to underserved areas. We bring equality to patients regardless of their location. We shine light where there is darkness by providing better outcomes to everyone we serve.
In 1962, the television cartoon family The Jettsons introduced the world to the impact that computers and advanced communications could have on our lives. The Jettsons were the harbingers of a world in which services, especially medical services, could be delivered directly from a place of convenience, such as your home. Unfortunately, even with the advancements in communications and computer technology of today, many people do not have access to basic health services, let alone specialty care. That is where Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. comes in.
MIHI is dedicated to shining lighting into the pockets of darkness designated as Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) by the U.S. government. When upwards of 80 million Americans don’t have access to quality medical care, something needs to be done. MIHI has developed the technology to deliver class-leading health care to MUAs because, to MIHI, being healthy means being free.
MIHI is a publicly traded company with strategic holdings in telemedicine, remote diagnostics, health care services, medical device development, and patient services. We set our sights on no less lofty of a goal that brining quality medical care to everyone in the country while simultaneously reducing the costs of accessing health care. We do that through our subsidiaries, 3PointCare and BKare, as well as through a tactical partnership with telemedicine provider TeleLifeMD, which maintains a roster of specialty health care practitioners.
Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. doesn’t just deliver quality health care to the masses though, it provides health care practitioners with the tools and data they need to analyze and optimize their own care giving. By developing software and professional services that make it possible for physicians to track outcome measures, balance measures, and process measures, MIHI is making it easier for doctors to fulfill their commitment to their patients.
By enabling our partners to understand the value of the care they deliver and track outcome measures like mortality, readmission rates, and surgical site infection rates, MIHI makes it possible for care providers to leverage data that can give them insight into their patient’s health. At MIHI, better outcomes matter.

("MIHI" or the "Company") (MIHI) is pleased to provide you with a shareholder update on the progress we made during fiscal year 2016. As we enter our fourth quarter of operations we are excited about our future and what that may bring to our company and our shareholders.  As such, we are ecstatic to present our goals and objectives for the upcoming 2017 fiscal year.By providing all manners of healthcare-related services and products on our various platforms, our goal is to create a comprehensive healthcare-centric business ecosystem unparalled by that of other industry-related companies. Our goal is for our revolutionary Telemedicine business model to become the focus of attention around which all other product and service offerings will revolve. We view our role in this industry as setting the standards and expectations for everyone involved. We seek to separate ourselves from traditional telemedicine competitors in the manner in which we setup, evolve, and expand the model into a national footprint.We consider our supporting organizations to function as feeders of both revenue and patients/consumers from one to the other to contribute to the creation of a diverse and ever-evolving ecosystem. An ecosystem demands, by its nature, a network of organizations that constantly cooperate and compete amongst themselves. We seek to evolve these relationships such that each business is flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of its own business and of the ecosystem to which it belongs.MIHI has elected, through organic and inorganic means, to stand up various subsidiaries that will become part of the ecosystem designed to support the future markets of the company with the intent of driving shareholder and market value. To date, we have created both 3Point Care and BKare Diagnostics. 3Point Care is a management service organization (MSO) with an exclusive contract relationship with TeleLife MD to provide telehealth services to our marketplace. BKare Diagnostics supports our entry into medical lab services, medical devices, and nutraceuticals.MIHI Leadership Team  The company's short lifecycle requires disruptive changes in leadership.  Lifting up a small startup requires a certain skill set different than one required for a stable and mature operating company. Even though MIHI has been operating since 1999, we consider it somewhat of a startup or new venture. This is primarily due to it having various elements that many startups have including a new business plan, new markets, new employees, a new brand, and of course, new leadership.  Expect changes as part of the natural evolutionary process of evolving from a start-up operation to becoming a fully functioning mature organization.  Our Market and Agenda It is estimated that 60-80 million Americans live in rural America where access to quality medical services is extremely limited.  Our government calls these areas Medically Underserved Areas (MUS) which are also known as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). These areas suffer from a shortage of primary care physicians as well as specialty physicians thereby forcing patients to go without continual care. The MUSs are our initial target market areas to roll out our specialty physician telemedicine services teaming with rural primary doctors. Our use of an established ecosystem with known rules, processes, and existing infrastructure allows us to readily connect thus granting us tremendous competitive advantage.To address this marketplace populated in a large diverse geographical area we need an array of products and services to serve the demands.In 2017 we expect to move, or continue to move, into the following areas:Provide remote specialty physician telemedicine services teaming with rural primary doctors in a referral based model providing an evidence base diagnosis enhancing the continuum of care.Develop, and/or acquire, an array of nutraceutical supplements offering a safe and effective alternative to pharma-industry based products.Study, develop, educate, and offer THC-based cannabis and non-THC based CBD products as an alternative to legacy pharma-industry based products. We believe we can provide a cheaper, safer, and better alternative.  There is no secret that drugs (legal) are harmful and many times ineffective where the side effects can be worse than the disease. The market demands a trusted alternative.Combine clinically tested nutraceutical and OTC homeopathic medicines/tinctures with Cannabis and CBD-based products to create a unique new marketplace expanding product diversity while offering new alternatives to a growing market.  Offer MSO (medical service organization) services to existing medical offices through our 3Point Care company.Offer traditional medical services such as lab services and pharmaceutical products to organizations and patients via new digital marketing and harvesting techniques.Move into the medical device market and remote patient monitoring to promote well-being and address the needs of the aging population.  2017 will be a very busy year.  In December 2016,we signed a letter of intent (LOI) to acquire our first business enterprise that will ultimately become our platform for nutraceuticals whereby we expand into additional nutraceutical offerings.  (At the time of this writing the transaction is not fully closed.) This acquisition seeks to provide us with gross and net revenue, a large customer base, and a proprietary product line while also serving to expand our presence into the cannabis and CBD environment.Read MoreWe expect to increase our ability to raise funds to cover the investment required to execute our plan and build out our healthcare-centric ecosystem.  All in all, we believe we are in a great position and we are happy you are with us.  For more information on MIHI, please visit the Company's website at http://www.medicalinnovationholdings.comTo be added to the Company investor email list, please email investor@MedicalInnovationHoldings.com with MIHI in the subject line.To leave a message please call +1-866-883-3793 for Investor RelationsFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined within Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  These statements relate to future events, including our ability to raise capital, or to our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (OTC: MIHI) Breaking News -
July 11, 2017
 

MEDICAL INNOVATION HOLDINGS, INC (“MIHI”) BEGINS MOVING TOWARD POSITIVE REVENUE
 
Enters 
Into a Definitive Purchase Agreement to Acquire Health and Lifestyle Supplements 
Company Designed for Better Living, Healthier and Longer Life
 
Deal 
Solidifies the Letter of Intent signed between the two companies on February 
2017 – the first in line of acquisitions that will help build our portfolio with 
services, medical devices, laboratory testing, nutraceuticals, and other 
services. 



DULUTH, GEORGIA – July 11, 2017 - Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (OTC:
MIHI) ("MIHI" 
or the "Company"), today announced that they have reached a Definitive Agreement 
with Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC (RHP) and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
(http://www.renownhealthproducts.com). Renaissance is a Florida-based 
nutraceutical company and under this agreement, MIHI will acquire 100% of the 
assets of the company in a cash and stock transaction valued between $2.5 to 
$3.5 million dollars. The Company will provide a proprietary product line with 
specialized formulations along with Trademarked product names. Along with the 
acquisition of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, MIHI will receive 
top and bottom-line revenue growth, robust customer base, existing staff and 
management, and certain 
marketing materials designed to promote the Renaissance product line. 

Renaissance is a nationally-known research and development company recognized 
for its portfolio of best-in-class, physician-developed, natural-health 
supplements designed to provide their customers with a better, healthier, and 
longer life. For over 16 years, Renaissance has used, and continues to use, the 
highest quality and concentration of powerful ingredients to create products 
that are naturally safe and proven to be effective. As a socially-responsible 
company, they do not perform any animal testing during any of its research and 
development.

Arturo “Jake” Sanchez, MIHI CEO and Director, stated: “This is the first of many 
more acquisition agreements to come… we will use RHP as a platform company to 
acquire additional supplement-based companies to add additional product lines. 
We are also benefiting our network of physician providers by increasing their 
access to readily available alternative sources to treat their patients while 
increasing the practice’s revenues. Under this agreement, we are giving the 
medical providers the opportunity to provide the best care for their patients by 
incorporating the latest advances in alternative nutraceuticals into their 
practice versus harmful and many times unresponsive pharma developed 
medicines.”***

Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc: 2017 
Shareholder Update
 



DULUTH, GEORGIA – May 10 2017 - Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (OTC:
MIHI) ("MIHI" 
or the "Company"), is pleased to provide you with a shareholder update on the 
progress we made during fiscal year 2016. As we enter our fourth quarter of 
operations we are excited about our future and what that may bring to our 
company and our shareholders. As such, we are ecstatic to present our goals and 
objectives for the upcoming 2017 fiscal year.

By providing all manners of healthcare-related services and products on our 
various platforms, our goal is to create a comprehensive healthcare-centric 
business ecosystem unparalled by that of other industry-related companies. Our 
goal is for our revolutionary Telemedicine business model to become the focus of 
attention around which all other product and service offerings will revolve. We 
view our role in this industry as setting the standards and expectations for 
everyone involved. We seek to separate ourselves from traditional telemedicine 
competitors in the manner in which we setup, evolve, and expand the model into a 
national footprint.

We consider our supporting organizations to function as feeders of both revenue 
and patients/consumers from one to the other to contribute to the creation of a 
diverse and ever-evolving ecosystem. An ecosystem demands, by its nature, a 
network of organizations that constantly cooperate and compete amongst 
themselves. We seek to evolve these relationships such that each business is 
flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of its own business and of the 
ecosystem to which it belongs.

MIHI has elected, through organic and inorganic means, to stand up various 
subsidiaries that will become part of the ecosystem designed to support the 
future markets of the company with the intent of driving shareholder and market 
value. To date, we have created both 3Point Care and BKare Diagnostics. 3Point 
Care is a management service organization (MSO) with an exclusive contract 
relationship with TeleLife MD to provide telehealth services to our marketplace. 
BKare Diagnostics supports our entry into medical lab services, medical devices, 
and nutraceuticals.

MIHI Leadership Team 

The company's short lifecycle requires disruptive changes in leadership. Lifting 
up a small startup requires a certain skill set different than one required for 
a stable and mature operating company. Even though MIHI has been operating since 
1999, we consider it somewhat of a startup or new venture. This is primarily due 
to it having various elements that many startups have including a new business 
plan, new markets, new employees, a new brand, and of course, new leadership. 
Expect changes as part of the natural evolutionary process of evolving from a 
start-up operation to becoming a fully functioning mature organization. 

Our Market and Agenda 

It is estimated that 60-80 million Americans live in rural America where access 
to quality medical services is extremely limited. Our government calls these 
areas Medically Underserved Areas (MUS) which are also known as a Health 
Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). These areas suffer from a shortage of primary 
care physicians as well as specialty physicians thereby forcing patients to go 
without continual care. The MUSs are our initial target market areas to roll out 
our specialty physician telemedicine services teaming with rural primary 
doctors. Our use of an established ecosystem with known rules, processes, and 
existing infrastructure allows us to readily connect thus granting us tremendous 
competitive advantage.

To address this marketplace populated in a large diverse geographical area we 
need an array of products and services to serve the demands.

In 2017 we expect to move, or continue to move, into the following areas:

Provide remote specialty physician telemedicine services teaming with rural 
primary doctors in a referral based model providing an evidence base diagnosis 
enhancing the continuum of care.

Develop, and/or acquire, an array of nutraceutical supplements offering a safe 
and effective alternative to pharma-industry based products.

Study, develop, educate, and offer THC-based cannabis and non-THC based CBD 
products as an alternative to legacy pharma-industry based products. We believe 
we can provide a cheaper, safer, and better alternative. There is no secret that 
drugs (legal) are harmful and many times ineffective where the side effects can 
be worse than the disease. The market demands a trusted alternative.

Combine clinically tested nutraceutical and OTC homeopathic medicines/tinctures 
with Cannabis and CBD-based products to create a unique new marketplace 
expanding product diversity while offering new alternatives to a growing market.


Offer MSO (medical service organization) services to existing medical offices 
through our 3Point Care company.

Offer traditional medical services such as lab services and pharmaceutical 
products to organizations and patients via new digital marketing and harvesting 
techniques.

Move into the medical device market and remote patient monitoring to promote 
well-being and address the needs of the aging population. 

2017 will be a very busy year. In December 2016,we signed a letter of intent (LOI) 
to acquire our first business enterprise that will ultimately become our 
platform for nutraceuticals whereby we expand into additional nutraceutical 
offerings. (At the time of this writing the transaction is not fully closed.) 
This acquisition seeks to provide us with gross and net revenue, a large 
customer base, and a proprietary product line while also serving to expand our 
presence into the cannabis and CBD environment.

We expect to increase our ability to raise funds to cover the investment 
required to execute our plan and build out our healthcare-centric ecosystem. All 
in all, we believe we are in a great position and we are happy you are with us.

MIHI Goes Global Entering New Markets with 
Letter of Intent to Acquire BBVI, an International Marketer and Consultancy
 

BBVI is in the business of 
providing strategic investment support and revenue growth opportunities in 
international markets. BBVI specializes in revenue generation, technology 
consulting, and financial consulting services. They primarily serve the medical 
marketplace.



DULUTH, GEORGIA – April 26, 2017 - Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (OTC:
MIHI) ("MIHI" 
or the "Company"), today announced that on April 26, 2017 it has entered into a 
Letter of Intent (LOI) with a Florida-based international consulting company ("BBVI"). 
Under the agreement MIHI will acquire 100% of the assets of BBVI in a stock 
transaction. BBVI will provide immediate access to its strategic client/customer 
base, share in the sale, ordering, and delivery of products and services to its 
customers. The acquisition insures revenue and profits for MIHI once the 
transaction is complete along with the beginning of building out a global 
footprint for the company. The transaction is contingent on the delivery of 
audited financials.

BBVI has been providing strategic consulting services to MIHI for the last year 
and a half. Through this relationship, it has been working with MIHI to expand 
its presence into international markets. BBVI has been successful in introducing 
MIHI to these markets and has taken the lead in penetrating certain foreign 
markets with high level business professionals and government 
entities/individuals. This has resulted in "winning" government bids that will 
allow MIHI to fulfill the orders and book the resulting revenue.

Arturo "Jake" Sanchez, CEO and Director, stated: "This is the next of many more 
acquisition agreements to come… we will use BBVI to penetrate international 
markets. This transaction will quickly improve both our balance sheet and income 
statement. You will see us be able to remove hundreds of thousands of past 
accruals to support and strengthen our 
balance sheet. You will also start to notice top and bottom-line revenue 
improvement. This acquisition expands our product line and customer base to 
include prescriptive drug sales. We are also benefiting our network of physician 
providers by increasing their access to prescriptive medicines to treat their 
patients. Under this agreement, we are optimistic we can expand our core 
telemedicine services into these countries as we expand pharma sales.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc.:
Medical Innovation Holding, 
Inc. (stock symbol – MIHI) is a publically traded company focused on reducing 
the costs of health care while simultaneously increasing quality of care, 
improving access to health services for millions, and monetizing assets to bring 
value to shareholders. MIHI is building a comprehensive telemedicine platform to 
bring unparalleled access to top-quality healthcare, in real time, to anyone who 
needs it.

Organized in Colorado, Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. is a conglomerate of 
companies built around the central theme of delivering quality health care to 
medically underserved areas. MIHI will bring about its strategic plan for 
delivering unparalleled access to real-time care through its subsidiaries: 
3PointCare and BKare Diagnostics.

3PointCare implements, manages, and supports the delivery of personalized 
virtual health encounters (i.e. telehealth). Its primary role is to support 
TeleLifeMD, a multi-disciplinary specialty health care practice with strong 
experience in telemedicine services. By providing administrative support that 
ranges from claims processing to software rollout, 3PointCare removes these 
burdens from TeleLifeMD so that its administration can focus on delivering 
world-class health care.

BKare is the products and services arm of MIHI and is tasked with delivering 
medical and health-related services other than medical consults. Offerings, such 
as laboratory testing and diagnostic services, are designed to support remote 
health care encounters. BKare also develops remote monitoring services and 
medical devices that can enhance patient well-being, prevent chronic disease, 
and enable telehealth providers to monitor patients and their conditions in real 
time from remote locations.

MIHI firmly believes that the best way to provide access to high-quality medical 
care is through support and delivery of evidence-based virtual medicine (a.k.a. 
telemedicine). To that end, MIHI is working to develop software and professional 
services that allow providers to track not only patient well-being, but the 
success of their interventions through their own personal care metrics. MIHI 
makes it possible for its providers to understand the care that they deliver so 
that they can work to transform the health care industry from the ground up.


Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. is applying cutting-edge technology and 
time-tested business practices to the health care industry to improve the 
quality of care delivered to patients. Telemedicine offers the perfect data-rich 
environment through which to tackle the challenges facing modern health care. By 
fulfilling its responsibility to deliver world-class health care to all of its 
patients, MIHI is simultaneously fulfilling its promise to deliver value to its 
shareholders who are as much a part of the revolution in health care as MIHI and 
its subsidiaries.

Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. (stock symbol MIHI) is in the business of 
delivering a nationwide, state-by-state, multidisciplinary medical specialist 
provider network. We bring top-quality medical care to underserved areas. We 
bring equality to patients regardless of their location. We shine light where 
there is darkness by providing better outcomes to everyone we serve.

In 1962, the television cartoon family The Jettsons introduced the world to the 
impact that computers and advanced communications could have on our lives. The 
Jettsons were the harbingers of a world in which services, especially medical 
services, could be delivered directly from a place of convenience, such as your 
home. Unfortunately, even with the advancements in communications and computer 
technology of today, many people do not have access to basic health services, 
let alone specialty care. That is where Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. comes 
in.

MIHI is dedicated to shining lighting into the pockets of darkness designated as 
Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) by the U.S. government. When upwards of 80 
million Americans don’t have access to quality medical care, something needs to 
be done. MIHI has developed the technology to deliver class-leading health care 
to MUAs because, to MIHI, being healthy means being free.

MIHI is a publicly traded company with strategic holdings in telemedicine, 
remote diagnostics, health care services, medical device development, and 
patient services. We set our sights on no less lofty of a goal that brining 
quality medical care to everyone in the country while simultaneously reducing 
the costs of accessing health care. We do that through our subsidiaries, 
3PointCare and BKare, as well as through a tactical partnership with 
telemedicine provider TeleLifeMD, which maintains a roster of specialty health 
care practitioners.

Medical Innovation Holding, Inc. doesn’t just deliver quality health care to the 
masses though, it provides health care practitioners with the tools and data 
they need to analyze and optimize their own care giving. By developing software 
and professional services that make it possible for physicians to track outcome 
measures, balance measures, and process measures, MIHI is making it easier for 
doctors to fulfill their commitment to their patients.

By enabling our partners to understand the value of the care they deliver and 
track outcome measures like mortality, readmission rates, and surgical site 
infection rates, MIHI makes it possible for care providers to leverage data that 
can give them insight into their patient’s health. At MIHI, better outcomes 
matter.

Many telemedicine providers offer access to subspecialty care, but very few can 
provide their patients and physicians with a completely integrated service that 
coordinates an entire health care encounter from beginning to end. Medical 
Innovation Holdings Inc. is working hard to develop a unique platform that will 
incorporate every aspect of a telemedicine visit into a single, comprehensive 
package. From real-time insurance verification to electronic prescriptions and 
remote diagnostics, MIHI is making it as easy as possible for its subspecialty 
physicians to provide fast, convenient, same-day consultations to every patient 
who needs care.

With the integrated system being developed by MIHI, patients will not have to 
put off getting the care that they need due to geographic constraints, 
limitations on traveling, or long backlogs at physician offices. MIHI’s 
nationwide network of specialty providers will deliver unparalleled access to 
quality healthcare in real time, which can reduce waiting times for specialty 
care and lower the costs associated with handling chronic care conditions. By 
offering outstanding practice management tools, seamless technology, and 
top-notch training to its customers, MIHI ensures that its specialty providers 
can focus on delivering world-class care to every patient. That is why MIHI is 
working to established an end-to-end dynamic telemedicine platform designed to 
meet the needs of both providers and patients. The results of this dedication to 
quality will be enhanced access to specialty medical care, reduced health care 
expenditures, and improved patient and provider satisfaction.

Medical Innovation Holdings Inc. seeks to enhance shareholder value not only 
through exceptional business performance and practices, but also through 
responsible and effective communication with its shareholders.
Feel free to review the latest company information relevant to the individual 
and institutional investor includes stock price and history, upcoming events and 
presentations and financial documents. Medical Innovation Holdings Inc. is 
traded on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol MIHI.

Medina International Holdings Inc. (or upon the effective date of the name 
change to Medical Innovation Holdings Inc.) is establishing a nationwide, state 
by state, multi-disciplinary specialist provider/practice network, staffed by 16 
types of Physician Specialists who serve the rural patient population via a 
seamless, comprehensive, sophisticated telemedicine program. Our platform is 
designed to bring unparalleled access to quality healthcare in real time, as 
needed, and create huge cost savings and efficiencies. Our fully integrated 
practice management system provides EMR/EHR, patient scheduling, real time 
insurance verification, billing, video conferencing and all systems in an end to 
end technology platform coupled with all the components of a dynamic telehealth 
delivery system. Our unique telemedicine platform brings together many different

Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc ("MIHI") Begins Moving Toward Positive Revenue









PR Newswire




Jul 11, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  DULUTH, Georgia, July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  Enters Into a Definitive Purchase Agreement to Acquire Health and Lifestyle Supplements Company Designed for Better Living, Healthier and Longer Life   Deal Solidifies the Letter of Intent signed between the two companies on February 2017  -   the  first in line of acquisitions that will help build our portfolio with services, medical devices, laboratory testing, nutraceuticals, and other services.    Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. ("MIHI" or the "Company") (OTC: MIHI), today announced that they have reached a Definitive Agreement with Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC (RHP) and its wholly owned subsidiaries ( http://www.renownhealthproducts.com). Renaissance is a Florida-based nutraceutical company and under this agreement, MIHI will acquire 100% of the assets of the company in a cash and stock transaction valued between $2.5 to $3.5 million dollars. The Company will provide a proprietary product line with specialized formulations along with Trademarked product names. Along with the acquisition of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, MIHI will receive top and bottom-line revenue growth, robust customer base, existing staff and management, and certain marketing materials designed to promote the Renaissance product line. Renaissance is a nationally-known research and development company recognized for its portfolio of best-in-class, physician-developed, natural-health supplements designed to provide their customers with a better, healthier, and longer life. For over 16 years, Renaissance has used, and continues to use, the highest quality and concentration of powerful ingredients to create products that are naturally safe and proven to be effective. As a socially-responsible company, they do not perform any animal testing during any of its research and development. Arturo "Jake" Sanchez, MIHI CEO and Director, stated: "This is the first of many more acquisition agreements to come… we will use RHP as a platform company to acquire additional  supplement-based companies to add additional product lines. We are also benefiting our network of physician providers by increasing their access to readily available alternative sources to treat their patients while increasing the practice's revenues. Under this agreement, we are giving the medical providers the opportunity to provide the best care for their patients by incorporating the latest advances in alternative nutraceuticals into their practice versus harmful and many times unresponsive pharma developed medicines."  About Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc.  MIHI, a Colorado-based publicly traded company, owns and operates strategically aligned health care service companies focused on the delivery of clinical virtual medicine (health) as a way of bringing quality medical care to all areas of need including rural and underdeveloped areas across the country.

DULUTH, Georgia, July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Enters Into a Definitive Purchase Agreement to Acquire Health and Lifestyle Supplements Company Designed for Better Living, Healthier and Longer Life 
Deal Solidifies the Letter of Intent signed between the two companies on February 2017  -  the  first in line of acquisitions that will help build our portfolio with services, medical devices, laboratory testing, nutraceuticals, and other services.   








Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. ("MIHI" or the "Company") (OTC: MIHI), today announced that they have reached a Definitive Agreement with Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC (RHP) and its wholly owned subsidiaries (http://www.renownhealthproducts.com). Renaissance is a Florida-based nutraceutical company and under this agreement, MIHI will acquire 100% of the assets of the company in a cash and stock transaction valued between $2.5 to $3.5 million dollars. The Company will provide a proprietary product line with specialized formulations along with Trademarked product names. Along with the acquisition of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, MIHI will receive top and bottom-line revenue growth, robust customer base, existing staff and management, and certain marketing materials designed to promote the Renaissance product line.
Renaissance is a nationally-known research and development company recognized for its portfolio of best-in-class, physician-developed, natural-health supplements designed to provide their customers with a better, healthier, and longer life. For over 16 years, Renaissance has used, and continues to use, the highest quality and concentration of powerful ingredients to create products that are naturally safe and proven to be effective. As a socially-responsible company, they do not perform any animal testing during any of its research and development.
Arturo "Jake" Sanchez, MIHI CEO and Director, stated: "This is the first of many more acquisition agreements to come… we will use RHP as a platform company to acquire additional  supplement-based companies to add additional product lines. We are also benefiting our network of physician providers by increasing their access to readily available alternative sources to treat their patients while increasing the practice's revenues. Under this agreement, we are giving the medical providers the opportunity to provide the best care for their patients by incorporating the latest advances in alternative nutraceuticals into their practice versus harmful and many times unresponsive pharma developed medicines."
About Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. 
MIHI, a Colorado-based publicly traded company, owns and operates strategically aligned health care service companies focused on the delivery of clinical virtual medicine (health) as a way of bringing quality medical care to all areas of need including rural and underdeveloped areas across the country. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, 3Point Care, we provide personalized high-tech high-touch telemedicine encounters pairing our virtual health specialty doctors with traditional primary doctors utilizing nextgen virtual health technologies in order to connect a patient with a multi-disciplinary specialty clinical healthcare practice. Through our other companies and relationships, we offer Affordable Care Organization (ACO) support, wellness and prevention, lab analysis and lab services, and remote diagnostic monitoring.
We serve a number of constituents and stakeholders interested in reducing the cost of care, enhancing the quality of care, promoting access to care, and maintaining the continuum of care.

	News Release



	 


	Medical Innovation Holdings,
	Inc: 2017 Shareholder Update




	 




	Duluth, GA – 05/10/17


	 


	Medical Innovation
	Holdings, Inc. (“MIHI” or the “Company”) (OTC: MIHI)

	is pleased to provide
	you with a shareholder update on the progress we made during fiscal year 2016. As we enter our fourth quarter of operations we
	are excited about our future and what that may bring to our company and our shareholders. As such, we are ecstatic to present our
	goals and objectives for the upcoming 2017 fiscal year.



	 


	By
	providing all manners of healthcare-related services and products on our various platforms, our goal is to create a comprehensive
	healthcare-centric business ecosystem unparalled by that of other industry-related companies. Our goal is for our revolutionary
	Telemedicine business model to become the focus of attention around which all other product and service offerings will revolve.
	We view our role in this industry as setting the standards and expectations for everyone involved. We seek to separate ourselves
	from traditional telemedicine competitors in the manner in which we setup, evolve, and expand the model into a national footprint.


	 


	We
	consider our supporting organizations to function as feeders of both revenue and patients/consumers from one to the other to contribute
	to the creation of a diverse and ever-evolving ecosystem. An ecosystem demands, by its nature, a network of organizations that
	constantly cooperate and compete amongst themselves. We seek to evolve these relationships such that each business is flexible
	and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of its own business and of the ecosystem to which it belongs.


	 


	MIHI
	has elected, through organic and inorganic means, to stand up various subsidiaries that will become part of the ecosystem designed
	to support the future markets of the company with the intent of driving shareholder and market value. To date, we have created
	both 3Point Care and BKare Diagnostics. 3Point Care is a management service organization (MSO) with an exclusive contract relationship
	with TeleLife MD to provide telehealth services to our marketplace. BKare Diagnostics supports our entry into medical lab services,
	medical devices, and nutraceuticals.



	 




	MIHI
	Leadership Team



	 


	The
	company’s short lifecycle requires disruptive changes in leadership. Lifting up a small startup requires a certain skill
	set different than one required for a stable and mature operating company. Even though MIHI has been operating since 1999, we consider
	it somewhat of a startup or new venture. This is primarily due to it having various elements that many startups have including
	a new business plan, new markets, new employees, a new brand, and of course, new leadership. Expect changes as part of the natural
	evolutionary process of evolving from a start-up operation to becoming a fully functioning mature organization.



	 







	 









	 







	 




	Our Market and Agenda



	 


	It
	is estimated that 60-80 million Americans live in rural America where access to quality medical services is extremely limited.
	Our government calls these areas Medically Underserved Areas (MUS) which are also known as a Health Professional Shortage Area
	(HPSA). These areas suffer from a shortage of primary care physicians as well as specialty physicians thereby forcing patients
	to go without continual care. The MUSs are our initial target market areas to roll out our specialty physician telemedicine services
	teaming with rural primary doctors. Our use of an established ecosystem with known rules, processes, and existing infrastructure
	allows us to readily connect thus granting us tremendous competitive advantage.


	 


	To
	address this marketplace populated in a large diverse geographical area we need an array of products and services to serve the
	demands.


	 


	In
	2017 we expect to move, or continue to move, into the following areas:



	 








	 




	1.




	Provide
	remote specialty physician telemedicine services teaming with rural primary doctors in a referral based model providing an
	evidence base diagnosis enhancing the continuum of care.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	Develop,
	and/or acquire, an array of nutraceutical supplements offering a safe and effective alternative to pharma-industry based products.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	3.




	Study,
	develop, educate, and offer THC-based cannabis and non-THC based CBD products as an alternative to legacy pharma-industry
	based products. We believe we can provide a cheaper, safer, and better alternative. There is no secret that drugs (legal)
	are harmful and many times ineffective where the side effects can be worse than the disease. The market demands a trusted
	alternative.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	4.




	Combine
	clinically tested nutraceutical and OTC homeopathic medicines/tinctures with Cannabis and CBD-based products to create a unique
	new marketplace expanding product diversity while offering new alternatives to a growing market.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	5.




	Offer
	MSO (medical service organization) services to existing medical offices through our 3Point Care company.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	6.




	Offer
	traditional medical services such as lab services and pharmaceutical products to organizations and patients via new digital
	marketing and harvesting techniques.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	7.




	Move
	into the medical device market and remote patient monitoring to promote well-being and address the needs of the aging population.








	 







	 









	 






	 


	2017
	will be a very busy year. In December 2016,we signed a letter of intent (LOI) to acquire our first business enterprise that will
	ultimately become our platform for nutraceuticals whereby we expand into additional nutraceutical offerings. (At the time of this
	writing the transaction is not fully closed.) This acquisition seeks to provide us with gross and net revenue, a large customer
	base, and a proprietary product line while also serving to expand our presence into the cannabis and CBD environment.


	 


	We
	expect to increase our ability to raise funds to cover the investment required to execute our plan and build out our healthcare-centric
	ecosystem. All in all, we believe we are in a great position and we are happy you are with us.

On June 27, 2017, the Registrant entered into an Asset Acquisition Agreement with Renaissance Health Publishing LLC. a Florida Limited Liability Company.
The consideration of the Asset Acquisition shall be due and payable as follows:
Purchase and Sale of Assets. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller does hereby sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer does hereby purchase from Seller, all of the goodwill and all of the assets used by or in connection with the Business, tangible or intangible, wherever located (the assets being transferred hereunder are collectively referred to as the “Purchased Assets”), including without limitation, all inventory of products and supplies and work in progress owned by Seller, all of Seller’s contracts (including, without limitation, all of Seller’s real property, computer, telephone and equipment leases) (collectively, the “Assigned Contracts”), prepaid expenses, machinery and equipment, manufacturer’s warranties, licenses, consents and permits, customer lists, training materials, trademarks, trade names, servicemarks, copyrights, techniques, know-how, show-how and other intangibles, except for the assets specifically set forth on Schedule 2.1 hereto (the “Excluded Assets”).
Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration to be paid to Seller for the Purchased Assets (the “Purchase Price”) shall consist of:
a) a cash payment at Closing in the amount of One Million and no/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the “Closing Date Payment”), payable via certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account that shall have been designated by Seller to Buyer prior to Closing; and
b) payment of an amount equal to the sum of: (x) four (4) times Seller’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the 12 month period ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the audit is completed (the “Audit Date”), as determined by an audit of Seller’s financial statements conducted by Assurance Dimensions, Inc. (the “Auditor”), plus (y) the value of Seller’s fully-paid inventory (calculated at Seller’s actual cost) of supplements and pre-printed direct mail pieces as of the Closing, minus (z) the Closing Date Payment (the “Formula Payment”). The Formula Payment shall be payable to the Convertible Promissory Note attached as Exhibit “A” hereto (the “Convertible Note”) and the obligations of Buyer under the Convertible Note shall be secured by the Security Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit “B” hereto. Seller shall be required to execute an inter-creditor agreement with the Senior Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Lender to which the Seller shall subordinate the priority of its lien on the collateral described in the Security Agreement to the lien on such collateral arising under the Senior Loan documents.
Allocation of Purchase Price. Within five (5) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (the “Allocation Schedule”). The Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule within five (5) days after delivery of the Allocation Schedule to Buyer. In the event of any such objection, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule to Buyer, such dispute shall be resolved by the Auditor or, if the Auditor is unable to serve, another impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants mutually appointed by Buyer and Seller. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer agree to file their respective IRS Forms 8594 and all federal, state and local tax returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule.
No Assumption of Liabilities. Buyer does not and shall not assume any debts, obligations or liabilities of any nature whatsoever of the Seller arising before or after the date hereof or in connection with any of the Purchased Assets or the Business of Seller (the “Excluded Liabilities”) other than the liabilities of the Seller disclosed on Schedule 2.4 hereto (the “Assumed Liabilities”). Seller agrees to satisfy and discharge the Excluded Liabilities as the same shall become due. Buyer agrees to satisfy and discharge the Assumed Liabilities as the same shall become due.
Non-assignable Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to the provisions of this Section 2.5, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Purchased Asset would result in a violation of applicable Law, or would require the consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (including any Governmental Entity), and such consent, authorization, approval or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof; provided, however, that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in Section 8.1 hereof, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof. Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or waiver. Once such consent, authorization, approval or waiver is obtained, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer the relevant Purchased Asset to which such consent, authorization, approval or waiver relates for no additional consideration.
To the extent that any Purchased Asset cannot be transferred to Buyer following the Closing to this Section 2.5, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such arrangements (such as subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the Parties the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, operational equivalent of the transfer of such Purchased Asset to Buyer as of the Closing and the performance by Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor for Seller pay, perform and discharge fully the liabilities and obligations of Seller thereunder from and after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller shall, at Buyer’s expense, hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, such Purchased Asset and all income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller to the extent related to such Purchased Asset in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.5. Seller shall be permitted to set off against such amounts all direct costs associated with the retention and maintenance of such Purchased Assets.
The Asset Acquisition Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and pre and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties will be subject to customary indemnification provisions, subject to specified aggregate limits of liability. The registrant has not completed the funding of this acquisition, and with the execution of this agreement it allows the Registrant to source funding for this acquisition.

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
