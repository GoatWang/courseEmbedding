Zillow is perfect for searching homes for sale in the United States. By analyzing real estate information on millions of homes for sale across the United States, we calculate home values (Zestimates) and the Zillow Home Value Price Index. Disclaimer: School attendance zone boundaries are supplied by Pitney Bowes and are subject to change. Check with the applicable school district prior to making a decision based on these boundaries.About the ratings: GreatSchools ratings are based on a comparison of test results for all schools in the state. It is designed to be a starting point to help parents make baseline comparisons, not the only factor in selecting the right school for your family.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.

Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]

In April 2011 Zillow acquired Postlets, an online real estate listing creation and distribution platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.[7]
In November 2011, Zillow acquired Diverse Solutions for $7.8 million.[8]
In May 2012, Zillow acquired RentJuice, a software-as-a-service company which allows landlords and property managers to market and lease their rental properties through a set of online tools. RentJuice was acquired for $40 million.[9]
On October 31, 2012, Zillow acquired the real estate shopping and collaboration platform, Buyfolio.[10]
On November 5, 2012, Zillow acquired Lincoln, NE based mortgage technology company Mortech for $17 million.[11]
On November 26, 2012, Zillow acquired HotPads for $16 million. HotPads, founded in 2005, lists real estate and rental listings on a map-based web interface.[12]
On August 19, 2013, Zillow acquired StreetEasy for $50 million.[13]
On July 16, 2014, Zillow acquired Retsly, a Vancouver, B.C.-based startup that helps developers access real-estate data from multiple listing services (MLS).[14]
On July 28, 2014, Zillow announced a deal to buy Trulia for $3.5 billion.[1][15]
On February 17, 2015, Zillow announced the completion of its acquisition of Trulia and the formation of the Zillow Group brand portfolio.[16]
On July 22, 2015, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Dotloop for $108 million.[17]
On January 3, 2016, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Naked Apartments for $13 million.[18]
On August 2, 2016, Zillow Group acquired Bridge Interactive.[19]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]

In April 2011 Zillow acquired Postlets, an online real estate listing creation and distribution platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.[7]
In November 2011, Zillow acquired Diverse Solutions for $7.8 million.[8]
In May 2012, Zillow acquired RentJuice, a software-as-a-service company which allows landlords and property managers to market and lease their rental properties through a set of online tools. RentJuice was acquired for $40 million.[9]
On October 31, 2012, Zillow acquired the real estate shopping and collaboration platform, Buyfolio.[10]
On November 5, 2012, Zillow acquired Lincoln, NE based mortgage technology company Mortech for $17 million.[11]
On November 26, 2012, Zillow acquired HotPads for $16 million. HotPads, founded in 2005, lists real estate and rental listings on a map-based web interface.[12]
On August 19, 2013, Zillow acquired StreetEasy for $50 million.[13]
On July 16, 2014, Zillow acquired Retsly, a Vancouver, B.C.-based startup that helps developers access real-estate data from multiple listing services (MLS).[14]
On July 28, 2014, Zillow announced a deal to buy Trulia for $3.5 billion.[1][15]
On February 17, 2015, Zillow announced the completion of its acquisition of Trulia and the formation of the Zillow Group brand portfolio.[16]
On July 22, 2015, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Dotloop for $108 million.[17]
On January 3, 2016, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Naked Apartments for $13 million.[18]
On August 2, 2016, Zillow Group acquired Bridge Interactive.[19]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]

In April 2011 Zillow acquired Postlets, an online real estate listing creation and distribution platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.[7]
In November 2011, Zillow acquired Diverse Solutions for $7.8 million.[8]
In May 2012, Zillow acquired RentJuice, a software-as-a-service company which allows landlords and property managers to market and lease their rental properties through a set of online tools. RentJuice was acquired for $40 million.[9]
On October 31, 2012, Zillow acquired the real estate shopping and collaboration platform, Buyfolio.[10]
On November 5, 2012, Zillow acquired Lincoln, NE based mortgage technology company Mortech for $17 million.[11]
On November 26, 2012, Zillow acquired HotPads for $16 million. HotPads, founded in 2005, lists real estate and rental listings on a map-based web interface.[12]
On August 19, 2013, Zillow acquired StreetEasy for $50 million.[13]
On July 16, 2014, Zillow acquired Retsly, a Vancouver, B.C.-based startup that helps developers access real-estate data from multiple listing services (MLS).[14]
On July 28, 2014, Zillow announced a deal to buy Trulia for $3.5 billion.[1][15]
On February 17, 2015, Zillow announced the completion of its acquisition of Trulia and the formation of the Zillow Group brand portfolio.[16]
On July 22, 2015, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Dotloop for $108 million.[17]
On January 3, 2016, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Naked Apartments for $13 million.[18]
On August 2, 2016, Zillow Group acquired Bridge Interactive.[19]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]

In April 2011 Zillow acquired Postlets, an online real estate listing creation and distribution platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.[7]
In November 2011, Zillow acquired Diverse Solutions for $7.8 million.[8]
In May 2012, Zillow acquired RentJuice, a software-as-a-service company which allows landlords and property managers to market and lease their rental properties through a set of online tools. RentJuice was acquired for $40 million.[9]
On October 31, 2012, Zillow acquired the real estate shopping and collaboration platform, Buyfolio.[10]
On November 5, 2012, Zillow acquired Lincoln, NE based mortgage technology company Mortech for $17 million.[11]
On November 26, 2012, Zillow acquired HotPads for $16 million. HotPads, founded in 2005, lists real estate and rental listings on a map-based web interface.[12]
On August 19, 2013, Zillow acquired StreetEasy for $50 million.[13]
On July 16, 2014, Zillow acquired Retsly, a Vancouver, B.C.-based startup that helps developers access real-estate data from multiple listing services (MLS).[14]
On July 28, 2014, Zillow announced a deal to buy Trulia for $3.5 billion.[1][15]
On February 17, 2015, Zillow announced the completion of its acquisition of Trulia and the formation of the Zillow Group brand portfolio.[16]
On July 22, 2015, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Dotloop for $108 million.[17]
On January 3, 2016, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Naked Apartments for $13 million.[18]
On August 2, 2016, Zillow Group acquired Bridge Interactive.[19]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]

Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

Before joining Zillow, Spencer was vice president of lodging for Expedia. In 1999, at the age of 24, Spencer co-founded Hotwire.com, a leading Internet travel company, which a few years later he sold to InterActiveCorp (the parent company of Expedia). Before his consumer web career, Spencer was in investment banking and private equity. He worked in the mergers and acquisitions group at Goldman Sachs and as an associate at TPG Capital. Spencer graduated cum laude from Harvard University.
