President

                                    Current                


Verger Capital Management LLC


                  Verger Capital specializes in asset allocation, portfolio construction and manager selection. They take a holistic view of the portfolio and seek to gain a deep understanding of the factors that are driving the portfolio’s risks and returns. Unlike asset classes, risk factors are flexible and allow deeper insight into the portfolio. Using this information, Verger Capital combines risk factors in a way that maximize the portfolio’s chances of success. They believe the result of this process is a well-balanced, diversified, and robust portfolio that is well-positioned to weather market downturns. Verger Capital also employs a factor-based approach to create a customized portfolio hedge to help limit losses and reduce volatility. Verger Capital''s manager selection process focuses on both a qualitative evaluation, as well as, a quantitative analysis. The qualitative evaluation researches the organization (background, structure, depth, and compensation scheme), analyzes its particular edge in sourcing opportunities, and evaluates the rigor of portfolio construction, risk management and strategy implementation. The quantitative analysis helps the firm thoroughly evaluate both return and risk by comparing historical results to both appropriate benchmarks. as well as, to managers with similar investment strategies.

Verger Capital Management






























First and foremost, we seek to protect the assets and viability of our clients.
Ours is a comprehensive vision of investing that weighs many variables and outcomes to help institutions move forward – while simultaneously seeking to mitigate the risks that can negatively affect their ability to succeed at a high level within their fields.










Running risk.
We believe risk is something to be navigated, not avoided. We believe opportunity is hiding everywhere, and our risk management processes designed to provide insight into what drives our portfolio returns.







Wide open and focused.
When it comes to selecting investment opportunities and managers, we believe there is no such thing as too much information. That's why we thoroughly research each manager before we do business, and continue to do so for the life of that relationship.

















Verger Capital Management






















 







We share your view of a bigger picture.
Our success fuels yours and allows our clients to do what they do best: create and capitalize on the opportunities that advance their respective institutions. Financial security creates scholarships, programs, technology, research, resources and facilities - and countless other means of both improving and empowering lives.










Partners in Climb
We carefully select and limit the number of institutions we work with to ensure that we can apply the level of dedication and proactivity required to met our high standards of practice.

















Verger Capital Management






























ProtectPerformProvide


It's more than a mantra.It's our zig to the industry's zag.
Alone, each represents a strategic position of great importance to many firms and their respective clients. Rather than isolating and owning just one, we choose to mold all three into a collective lens from which to view our clients' investments.







A management company that believes in supporting others with a higher purpose, Verger Capital Management, LLC provides investment management services primarily to institutions that serve philanthropic purposes. With over $1 billion under management, our investment team’s direct experience with non-profit institutions offers a deeper understanding of this segment’s unique needs. These needs drive our vision to Protect, Perform and Provide in order to strive to create both advantage and efficiency for our clients.














Verger Capital Management






























Performance means only one thing at Verger: results.
We seek to develop productive and sustainable investment strategies that target performance over inflation to improve the purchasing power of our client institutions.










Play big.
Scale is a smaller fish's best friend. Verger offers smaller not-for-profit institutions experienced talent they often cannot afford, with the distinctive perspective they often cannot find.







The numbers have left the building. Outsourcing may reduce administrative burdens and costs, while providing you with access to top industry talent.







It's a matter of time.
If time is money, we can help you with both. Verger's focus is on the financial health of your institution, leaving you with more time to focus on everything else.














Verger Capital Management





























Our Unique Position
We're not like the others.
We believe talent can thrive in a simple environment that focuses on the goals of our clients. Verger was created with a goal of helping our clients invest in their students, patients and patrons.






We have a flat org chart.
Our org chart is vertically challenged by design - it's how we maintain an interactive and results-driven culture. Not only does this create an environment that attracts top talent and gives them a reason to stay, it provides our clients with direct access to a senior-level team with extensive knowledge of their business.






We act like we own the place.
Verger was structured in a way that will allow team members to be monetarily invested. Creating not only incentive, but stability for the company as well as our clients. We find that to be a powerful motivator.







Generalists specialize in doing more.
Markets fluctuate, situations are not always what they seem and the window of opportunity closes quickly. When you can wear a lot of hats, you don't need as many heads. And we believe that's good for business.
