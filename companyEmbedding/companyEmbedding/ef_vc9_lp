We transform dreams into international opportunities

The future belongs to those who speak multiple languages

At Home
Abroad
Online



An EF language course can help you talk to the world, in English or in 6 other widely spoken languages. We have fully accredited schools in 46 of the world’s most exciting cities, as well as English Live – the world’s largest online English school.

Abroad



EF leads professionally guided tours to the world’s greatest sights and landscapes. Itineraries can be tailored to the needs of teachers and students at any level: elementary, high school, or university. We also handcraft adventures and active vacations for American adults of all ages and interests.

ACADEMIC STUDY
International careers await with a globally recognized degree

At Home
Abroad



We offer degree programs at secondary, university, and post-graduate levels. Students who attend our schools graduate with preferred admission to the world’s best universities. We are also associated with Hult International Business School, renowned for its top-ranked MBA and bachelor programs.

CULTURAL EXCHANGE
Living the American Dream with an exchange year in the US

Abroad



Our exchange programs give young adults the chance to experience America as a native, rather than a tourist. Host families provide safe and secure homes in typical US communities for our high school students choosing to study for a year abroad.

Hi VC++ team,  We are developing a commercial product that requires VC90 re-distributable dlls to work properly (msvcr90.dll, msvcp90.dll, msvcm90.dll).  The LICENSE AGREEMENT states, "You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices ". However it is not properly mentioned whether we can re-distribute these dlls by bundling them with our product.  Please clarify, whether we can bundle the dlls with our product.  regards, Kingsley ReubenKings

Hi Santosh,  Thanks for the URL. It illustrates how to use the re-distributable dlls.   However, the LICENSE clause for bundling the dlls and re-distributing them with the product is not clearly mentioned elsewhere in the document.  regards Kingsley ReubenKings

I will try and get you the link where it has been mentioned that these dependents are redistributable, but I know this for a fact.
Maybe somebody from MS can answer this.«_Superman_»

The files in your c:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 2008\vc\redist (or equivalent) folder should have been updated to the latest versions.  Are these the merge modules you are referring to?  From other threads, it seems MS did also
 update the vc_redist on their website, but after the problems found with this update, they put back the old version.
