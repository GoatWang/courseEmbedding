Infrastructure Debt Fund III


How the fund works
As pioneers in infrastructure debt, we have dedicated specialists with skills and experience investing in the subordinated debt of defensive, non-cyclical infrastructure businesses headquartered in Western Europe, North America and Australia. Our experienced investment team directly structures and arranges subordinated debt using our strong proprietary deal flow through long standing sponsor relationships. We follow a detailed and rigorous due diligence program that has led to a successful track record for over 15 years. This approach delivers our clients lower volatility, strong risk-adjusted returns and consistent cash yields.
The 10 year closed ended Fund is seeking US$ 2 billion in aggregate capital commitments and aims to provide long term long term investors with a target return of 10% with a focus on current cash yield.



Why invest in the fund?






Experienced investment team which has generated consistent returns through economic cyclesThe investment team represents one of the world’s most experienced subordinated debt arrangers, underwriters and investors. Based in London, Sydney and New York, the investment team has more than 127 years of combined experience arranging, investing and monitoring infrastructure debt investments across a range of sectors and geographies.







A successful track record in infrastructure debt investingThe infrastructure debt team has a track record of investing in debt of infrastructure businesses dating back to 2001. In its history, this investment team has invested more than US$2.7 billion in 53 infrastructure debt assets. AMP Capital is one of the longest standing participants in global infrastructure investments, with a prior track record commencing in 1988.







Extensive deal sourcing capabilityWith a key focus on originating and structuring tailored mezzanine solutions for infrastructure assets, the team is able to source attractive investment opportunities which are only available to our investors. These skills allow us to maintain our extensive global network of relationships with issuers, equity providers and financial advisory firms of private infrastructure debt.







Strong deal flowCurrently in the global infrastructure debt market there are strong deal flow opportunities with limited competition from alternative junior lenders. These factors provide the potential to generate attractive risk adjusted returns focused on cash yield and represent a compelling opportunity for infrastructure debt investors.







Market opportunityDemand for infrastructure (including road, rail, power, telecommunications and water) is set to continue to expand significantly over the next few decades, driven largely by global economic growth, changes in public policy and financing, technological progress, climate change, urbanization and growing population and congestion. Many parts of infrastructure systems in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are ageing rapidly, public finances are becoming increasingly unavailable, certain economies are facing increased fiscal deficits, and infrastructure financing has generally become more complex. In particular, as significant additional private and public capital is committed to greenfield infrastructure investment over the coming years, it is expected that opportunities to acquire brownfield infrastructure assets, either from the public sector or from private owners in secondary transactions, will also increase.







Pioneer in infrastructure investmentAMP Capital’s scale, widespread resources and brand provide the investment team with a unique competitive advantage in deal origination and execution. The investment team utilises the broader resources of the AMP Capital global infrastructure team, particularly the experienced industry research specialists. The team also has access to structuring and operating professionals with legal, tax and fund accounting skills.







Focus on rigorous due diligence and risk managementThe investment team represents one of the world’s most experienced subordinated debt arrangers, underwriters and investors. Based in London, Sydney and New York, the investment team has more than 127 years of combined experience arranging, investing and monitoring infrastructure debt investments across a range of sectors and geographies.



What are the key risks associated with the fund?



Prospective investors should refer to the Private Placement Memorandum and consider factors relating to investment risks. As a result of risk factors, as well as other risks inherent in any investment, an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors. There can be no assurance that the fund will meet its investment objective or that investors will receive a return of their capital. Prospective investors should consult with their own advisors before deciding to invest in the fund.

Infrastructure



A fast-growing asset class with a strong global growth profile
Infrastructure is one of the fastest growing asset classes globally, with target infrastructure allocations increasing significantly over recent years1. We expect portfolio allocations to infrastructure assets to rise further in coming years as the benefits of investing in infrastructure are increasingly recognised.
There is a significant need for new infrastructure in both developed and developing economies. It is estimated that approximately US$57 trillion needs to be invested in global infrastructure by 20302. This means there will be a broad and growing range of infrastructure investment opportunities.

Listed infrastructure

Expertise on the ground on four continents
More than 25 years of market leadership




Why infrastructure?


In our view, the benefits of this asset class offer a compelling fit for investors seeking a blend of stability and attractive returns.








Low volatility
Infrastructure assets are often regulated and exhibit strong monopolistic qualities with high barriers to entry. These characteristics mean infrastructure assets can be less volatile than traditional asset classes.










Stable, long-term cash flows
Long-duration asset lives may make for stable, long-term cash flows linked to inflation.










Natural diversification
A range of sub-sectors within infrastructure may offer natural opportunities to build well-diversified portfolios that can perform throughout the economic cycle.




Why AMP Capital? 


AMP Capital is a pioneer in infrastructure investment with more than 25 years of leadership in the asset class. We began investing in direct infrastructure in the late 1980s, through finance participation in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.
Our infrastructure investment team’s capabilities span research, origination and due diligence, transaction execution, asset management and portfolio construction and management.
Be it a petroleum pipeline in Spain, a wind farm in Nebraska or an airport in Australia, AMP Capital clients can access the benefits of infrastructure by investing in listed and unlisted infrastructure equity, providing a gateway into projects that retail investors may typically find difficult to access.
Scale
As one of the leading infrastructure managers, our size, reputation and networks mean we can provide access to innovative investment opportunities across a range of sectors globally. This includes investments in energy, power, transport, utilities, airports, seaports, communications infrastructure and social infrastructure.
Breadth
AMP Capital’s infrastructure team features more than 70 infrastructure investment professionals* across the globe. The infrastructure team has specialist and extensive experience spanning a diverse range of sectors, lifecycles and geographic regions. It also spans the full range of ways to invest in infrastructure, whether it’s through equity or debt, in both listed and unlisted markets.
Information advantage
Our clients may benefit from the information advantage that comes from AMP Capital’s scale and breadth as well as our culture of collaboration across many teams. Our expertise spans infrastructure, real estate, fixed income, equities, multi-asset investing and macro markets. Collaboration between these teams informs our decision-making process.


Why now?


Infrastructure’s low correlation to most other asset classes may help insulate investors from financial market volatility and often offer income streams higher than those typically available in today’s low interest rate environment.
Listed infrastructure securities
Global listed infrastructure companies may offer investors higher dividend or coupon payments than global equities and global bonds, respectively, as operating margins are often high and cash flows are very stable. It may also offer investors a highly liquid way to gain exposure to infrastructure.
Unlisted infrastructure equity 
Direct infrastructure investment may provide diversification benefits and attractive risk-adjusted returns as well as low correlation with most other asset classes.

We focus on ‘core and pure’ infrastructure assets


We only invest in companies we believe provide a sufficient return for the commensurate risk. Our philosophy is centred around an investment approach which focuses on ‘core and pure’ infrastructure assets. These are companies that own and operate infrastructure assets with no or low exposure to commodity, volume and competition risks.  We believe that these assets can provide investors with superior risk-reward characteristics.


What sets us apart


             
        







In-depth understanding of local market conditions
With investment professionals based in Sydney, London and Chicago, our team is close to the major markets and has an in-depth understanding of local market conditions.










Our investment process uses local expertise in a globally integrated approach
Our investment process involves a fundamental bottom-up analysis of both valuation and equity. We use our in-depth knowledge of local markets to apply this analysis, and complement it with an analysis of top-down factors.










Proven history across geographies, lifecycles and sectors
As one of the first infrastructure investors, we have a long history of infrastructure investing across multiple jurisdictions and sectors, and throughout market cycles.










Culture of collaboration provides an information advantage
With more than 70 investment professionals across our infrastructure platform, constant communication and information sharing across the team enable us to capitalise on our depth and breadth of coverage.




Risks


Risks specific to infrastructure investments include the risks of investing in share markets, infrastructure and international markets. In addition, the risks associated with interest rates, gearing and the cost of debt, derivatives, investment management, co-ownership of assets, fluctuations in rental income, rental demand and fund termination risks. Please refer to the relevant fund’s Information Memorandum or Product Disclosure Statement for more information.

Infrastructure


Infrastructure is one of the fastest growing asset classes, globally.
Portfolio allocations to infrastructure have grown significantly in recent years. This trend is expected to heighten in coming years as the benefits of investing in infrastructure are increasingly recognised.
There is a significant need for new infrastructure in both developed and developing economies. It is expected that almost US$78 trillion will be spent globally between 2014 and 2025 on capital projects and infrastructurei. With governments across the globe burdened with high levels of debt, fewer infrastructure projects are likely to be publicly funded. The need for private capital to replace aging infrastructure or fund new projects will consequently persist over the long term and will support a broad and growing range of infrastructure investment opportunities.
At AMP Capital, investors can access the benefits of infrastructure by investing in infrastructure equity, unlisted and listed, as well as private infrastructure debt.
