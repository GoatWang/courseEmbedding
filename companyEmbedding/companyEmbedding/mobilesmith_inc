We noticed that there were a lot of different pregnancy apps, but each had very limited information, so we went through and put an app together that covered all of the things a new mom would need to know.  With the MobileSmith platform, prototyping, testing, and building our new app for multiple mobile platforms proved to be an easy and rewarding experience.
Heather Noack,
Learning Production Manager at Customized Communications

We were impressed with how easy and quick it was to prototype, build and launch our Freeman Everywhere app with the MobileSmith platform. We expect great results from our mobile app strategy, having designed our first app to meet our mobile patients’ needs as another convenience to stay in touch and up-to-date with our health system.
Liz Syer, Director of Marketing
Freeman Health System



August 15, 2016




 




Engaging our customers on mobile is very important to us, so we decided to launch a helpful, targeted mobile app to meet their needs.  The MobileSmith Platform allows us not only to roll out apps for iOS and Android in a matter of weeks, but also to manage them long-term – all that within our marketing team.
Stevie Jo Brown, VP of Marketing
United Regional Health Care System



August 15, 2016




 




This mobile app that we built on the MobileSmith platform is, by far, more impressive than our mobile site – so much so that I believe it is worthy of recognition. I’m excited to share both our mobile app as well as our story with others.

These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
