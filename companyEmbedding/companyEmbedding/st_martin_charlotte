About Us














  [View Printable Page] Home  > About Us


 
             



 

Welcome to St. Martin's Episcopal Church
			 
Saint Martin's is a parish in the Diocese of North Carolina, a part of the Episcopal Church; and the Episcopal Church is a member of the world-wide Anglican Communion (with 70 million members in 163 countries).

			As Episcopalians and Anglicans we are a community of Christians bound together by shared faith and understanding.  This faith comes from our belief that the Bible contains the experience of God's call to restoration ultimately realized through Jesus.  Our understanding of the Bible grows out of reading, studying, and scholarship.  This understanding comes out of the interpretation of the Bible and the Christian faith beginning with the writings from the earliest centures of the Church on down to today.  This is shaped, too, by our God-given ability to think, to question, to explore, to listen, and to know that God's revelation is a living one.

			Scripture - Tradition - Reason are the three components in the process of understanding our call to serve God by serving others.
			Our faith is lived out through:

Worshipping God 
Making prayer a central part of our lives 
Continuing to study in order to grow in the faith 
Serving others both within the parish and out into the community by mission & outreach
Supporting the ministries by giving time, energy, & money

Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.







St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.







St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.







St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.

St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.

Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.







St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.

Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.

Heading to see my church family now, love this place! Friendly, welcoming, Jesus focused and an awesome choir! Love the traditional liturgy and the timely preaching.







St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.







St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.







St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.

St. Martin's is a wonderfully welcoming, family-friendly, and singles-friendly church that makes Charlotte seem like a smaller town because of St. Martin's warm atmosphere. Everyone supports each other and we focus on spirituality and positivity. The church has great music, adult formation, and child formation, and most of all an excellent Pastor. Best of all, there's room for everyone at St. Martin's.

St. Martins is a Jesus focused congregation where we together discern many aspects of our lives and welcome all. We provide christian education for all on Sunday mornings and have many ministries for all to get and be involved. Come at 8:30 or 10:45am Sunday for one of our services.

St. Martin's has been so welcoming to my family.  We are new to North Carolina (less than a year) and feel like we hit the jackpot for fit in a church home. This is a warm, inclusive, happy place to be.  I highly recommend it.
