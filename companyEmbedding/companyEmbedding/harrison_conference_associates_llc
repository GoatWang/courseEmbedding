Welcome to Harrison Training

In a rapidly changing and fast developing world, there is a need to be responsive and adaptable. This is particularly true within the areas of health and social care provision, which are currently undergoing significant change.
At Harrison Training, our overall objective is to provide the ‘stepping stones’ by which our clients, individuals or teams, can acquire and develop the skills needed to respond to these demands effectively, now and in the future. We are not interested in delivering quick and easily forgotten training courses. Instead, we work with our clients to provide high quality training which develops teams for the long term. We do this by providing, either ‘in-service’, or organised events for individuals to attend:


team development/training days
clinical skills development pathways for modular learning
individual courses
advice or consultancy, e.g. service review and development
mentoring or supervision

Our network of highly skilled and experienced Associates enables us to offer a wide range of services, and work with increasing numbers of clients (both public and private sector) in identifying appropriate resources to meet demands for service improvement and Continuous Professional Development (CPD). These include in areas of clinical practice, leadership and professional skill development.

CIMT has gone Russian!
 Read about it in the CSP's Front Line
A book about constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT), written by two British therapists, is gaining global attention and has now been translated into
Russian.
How to do constraint-induced movement therapy:
A practical guide was co-authored by Annie Meharg, a
private physio and associate for course provider at
Harrison Training, and occupational therapist Jill Kings,
the clinical director of Neural Pathways.
It is the only published guide on how to do CIMT,
which is the best-evidenced intervention for recovery
of arm function after stroke.
The book was positively reviewed in Frontline
(18 May 2016 issue) by Adine Adonis, vice-chair of
the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in
Neurology.
Mrs Meharg told Frontline: ‘It’s vital that therapists
have the practical know how to undertake CIMT and
that people with stroke and other neurological disorders
get the opportunity to benefit from this high-intensity,
task-specific intervention.
‘And it’s very rewarding to feel that we’ve
contributed to the use of CIMT, not just in the UK but
beyond.’

How to do Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) for Children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy
25th of March 2017
Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is a treatment technique involving restraint of the less affected upper limb combined with task practice to promote upper limb function in the hemiplegic arm after stroke or brain injury. This course focuses on the use of this technique with children who are neurologically impaired.
It is designed for occupational therapists and physiotherapists and will provide an update of the CIMT evidence base and its application to working with children. It will also facilitate the development of work place CIMT treatment protocols to enable participants to set up their own CIMT service

Participants will:
Gain an understanding of how to identify children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy who may benefit functionally from a constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) approach
Revise current evidence regarding neuroplasticity and how CIMT maximises this for optimum functioning  in children and young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy
Explore current evidence and critically evaluate protocols for constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT), specifically with children
Develop knowledge for the successful implementation of CIMT protocols into practice
Gain practical skills and experience of task specific therapy and shaping techniques used in the CIMT approach. Participate in role-play activities and in the discussion of case scenarios of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy who have received (or may benefit from) a programme of CIMT

CIMT book review
CSP's Frontline Magazine has just reviewed our new CIMT book.

"This book delivers what it says on the tin. It is useful for therapists thinking of setting up a constraint induced therapy (CIMT) programme or those interested in what it may look like but are unsure where to start."

"If you need examples of intensive exercises, patient information leaflets or checklists, I would highly recommend this book."

Adine Adonis - Vice chair of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Neurology.

 CIMT Book Review

How to do Constraint Induced Movement Therapy - a practical guide. Just £28.80 (including VAT)
We are pleased to announce the launch of our new book on CIMT. The book is aimed at any therapist who wants to find out more about CIMT or to implement a CIMT programme into their service. The book is structured to help you understand what CIMT is and is not and is supported throughout by tips and ideas from therapists and clients who have used this technique. It is intended to bridge the gap between the evidence base for CIMT and day-to-day practice. To find out more or to place an order please contact us.

Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)
‘Enormous benefit’ of therapy overlooked.
An innovative and evidence-based treatment for stroke is being underused, says a physio who has developed a training course in the technique.
Constraint Induced Movement Therapy is recommended in the National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke, says Annie Meharg,Physiotherapist, who has 20 years’ NHS experience in neurological rehab units at hospitals such as Homerton and the Royal Free in London.
But physios don’t feel confident about using this challenging treatment, says Annie Meharg, who developed the one-day course with colleague Jill Kings, an occupational therapist.
Aimed at highly motivated patients after hemiplegia, CIMT involves restraining the unaffected arm while giving intensive task practice to promote use of the affected arm.
‘We’re giving people a task on the border between possible and impossible,’ says Annie Meharg. ‘That’s challenging for physios too. But it has the potential to be of enormous benefit for some patients.’
The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists Interested in Neurology says CIMT is an ‘emerging tool’ that is well researched for treating certain stroke patients.
Reference: Frontline Magazine, 21 July 2010, authors Annie Meharg and Jill Kings (Frontline author: Joy Ogden)

CPD Portfolio Online Tool At last! – Harrison Training take the Pain out of CPD...
Harrison Training have developed a long-awaited, easy to use continuing professional development (CPD) tool that really does make it easier to create and maintain a Health Care Professionals’  legally required CPD Portfolio. CPDonLine (CPDoL) can be easily accessed from the Harrison Training website and provides an interactive, online portfolio system in which to organise and record CPD evidence. The facility provides comprehensive and up to date descriptions of CPD terms and requirements; easy to follow guidance as to how to write and maintain your portfolio; and useful links to a wide range of CPD resources.
For me, this beats any of the current CPD tools available to Occupational Therapists because it is electronic and this offers a number of attractive features.  My office space is small with very limited space for filing documents and files. With CPDoL, I no longer need to transport and store paper documents and heavy lever arch files - I can upload certificates and written notes, store them electronically, and then dispose of the paper as necessary. I have the option to request electronic versions of course notes and certificates for the future to upload direct into CPDoL.  I can now dip into my CPD Portfolio from a number of different interface terminals, including my iphone which offers me the opportunity to update quickly after a CPD event from home, office, or train! Finally, CPDoL is visually attractive and fun to use and this is very motivating. Whereas in the past I have worried about being behind with organising my CPD documentation and slow to get on with it, I now feel confident that I will be able to keep my portfolio interesting, accurate and up to date.

Clinical Specialist OT (Older People)
I do not think I am alone when I say that I have attempted, struggled and failed on numerous occasions to find a way of recording and maintaining my CPD activities. However, the CPD online tool has finally provided me with a method of achieving what I once thought was an onerous task. What I like about the tool is that I can access it wherever I am (at work or at home) without having to carry around a huge paper file. The sections provide a step-by-step approach to recording, maintaining and evidencing CPD activities in a reflective and meaningful way. The explanation drop boxes are really helpful as they walk you through what you need to be recording. Not only does the tool provide you with opportunity to record present CPD activities it provides advice on how to develop and plan for your future CPD, so for me the tool feels like it is a living thinking and as it grows I know it will positively influence and support my career development.

Charitable Activity
Part of our Company vision is to support those who are disabled and have limited access to healthcare resources, economic independence, and choices in their lives and occupations. We have found that these people, particularly in developing countries, also tend to be poor, disadvantaged, and marginalised within their communities.
We believe that we reap what we sow. To reflect something of our values, beliefs and purpose, we are committed to giving of our time, skills, knowledge, and profit, to benefit those who have less, particularly where disability is an issue.
Harrison Training has partners in Romania and Tanzania, with whom we collaborate, to provide practical and tangible support that impacts the daily lives of individuals affected by disability, and their caregivers.
