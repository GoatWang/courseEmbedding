Skye212Lafayette, Louisiana54Reviewed July 21, 2016 Beautiful and Woodsy, Affordable CampingThis park is very pretty and natural, which is what I prefer over the typical "resort" setting of most RV parks.

Investment firm dedicated to the single-family rental industry










Our Investment Strategy - Lafayette Real Estate



OUR MISSION 


Our Strategy
Our Ethics





						Founded in 2011 by Thibault Adrien, Lafayette RE LLC is a New York-based private equity firm focused on the single family homes for rent asset class in the U.S.. 

Lafayette's single family homes funds' strategy consists in acquiring, renovating, and renting single family homes that are sold by banks via short sales, foreclosure sales or real estate owned (REO) sales. 

Lafayette uses its longstanding network and relationships with auction, due diligence, renovation and property management teams across its various markets to source below-market deals, build in initial equity returns, achieve healthy net rental yields as well as substantial capital appreciation potential for its investors.

Lafayette has extended the scope of its activities to include a land fund, a property management business and a lending platform.

Brandywine Homes USA is our fully owned property management arm, focused on improving the quality of service provided to our tenants. Brandywine Homes USA enhances investors returns by maximizing renewal rates and allowing a better control over maintenance costs. 

Lafayette currently manages three funds on behalf of its investors, invested across  around 1,400 single family homes and 150 vacant land lots.					



Lafayette relies on the highest ethical standards. 

Vis-a-vis our investors, we strive to provide best-in-class reporting with complete transparency on key performance indicators or managers' compensations. Through our Advisory Committee, we set in place corporate governance tools. 

We treat our tenants with great care, as our clients. Their satisfaction is always our primary goal and we got rewarded by low default rates and highest renewal rates. 

Lafayette also fuels the local economy by creating local jobs through property management and renovation work. We are providing a much needed service for communities in our markets by removing distressed inventory and providing good quality, affordable housing for families. These efforts are, ultimately, stimulating economies in the areas hardest hit by the housing crisis.
