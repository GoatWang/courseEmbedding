November 2016  L3 to Provide Power Distribution and Switchgear Equipment for the U.S. Navy's Stealthiest Submarine Program


March 17, 2016  L3 to Provide Power Node Control Center® for the U.S. Navy Destroyer Program








 








About











With over a hundred years of experience dating back to Henry Cutter's first "inverse time element" circuit breaker in the late nineteenth century, L3 SPD Electrical Systems (L3 SPDES) is the world's leading supplier of innovative shock-hardened circuit breakers and switchgear for harsh environment applications. SPD Electrical Systems has predominantly supplied the U.S. Navy with power distribution systems installed on every surface combatant, submarine and aircraft carrier.

                In addition to decades of providing in-house designs, L3 SPDES has worked in collaboration with commercial circuit breaker suppliers to militarize commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products for application in combatant environments. This approach has yielded advances such as L3 SPDES' air circuit breakers, which allow increased automation and reduced manning through local and remote-state monitoring and control of circuit breaker parameters.

                L3 SPDES continues to support decades of fielded circuit breaker products through a factory-based repair and overhaul center staffed by dedicated personnel and supported by factory resident engineering. L3 SPDES is located in Northeast Philadelphia and is comprised of nearly 200 engineering, program management, production and support professionals.

Surge Protective DevicesSiemens Surge Protection SolutionsIn today's electronic world, electrical systems for the home or business are not complete unless they incorporate surge protection. Surges must be stopped before they enter and cause damage to appliances and equipment, and this is best accomplished by installing hard-wired surge protective devices (SPDs) at key electrical system surge entry points.Siemens is committed to providing high quality surge protective devices for application in residential, commercial, and industrial electrical systems. Our Transient Protection System (TPS) and FirstSurge families of surge protective devices ensure the highest possible electrical system safety, protection, and reliability, while delivering some of the industry's best performance ratings.Explore the tabs below to learn more about the surge protective devices that Siemens has to offer.TPS3 01Type 1 / 2 Surge Protective Device (SPD) for P1, P2 Lighting Panelboards and P3 Power Distribution Panelboards, Motor Control Centers and Busway Systems.Click on the images above to view Siemens' Surge Protective Devices.Internal Surge ProtectionSuppressing surge voltages to harmless levels is the primary means by which hardwired SPDs protect electronics and electrical loads. This function is enhanced or inhibited depending upon the length of the SPD's connecting cables. Siemens' line of factory installed internal TPS3 SPDs (switchgear, switchboards, panelboards, MCCs, busway and more) consistently assures optimal performance through direct bus bar connections or minimal cable connections. This translates to some of the industry's best:Installed Voltage Protection Ratings (VPRs)Across the board Type 1 or Type 4 SPDs intended for use in Type 1 applicationsVoltage codes carrying UL's highest robustness rating, I n of 20kASurge current capacities ranging from 100kA to 1000kAFor mission critical or government applications requiring increased "mode" redundancy, Siemens TPS3's can be configured with directly connected L-L MOVs for "True 10-mode" or "Discrete" protection.Features and BenefitsTPS TranSafe Enabled – Our patented TranSafe fault current protection circuitry provides peace of mind that your electronic loads are protected and that your electrical system will not go down due to SPD fault control operations.Integral or Internally Mounted for Optimized Protection – Internal surge protection dramatically reduces installation impedance allowing for superior installed suppressed voltage capabilities.SAD/MOV Hybrid Suppression – For mission critical applications needing the absolute best suppressed voltage, our hybrid SAD/MOV suppressors combine tight clamping technology with integrated suppression, delivering the strongest installed protection capabilities available.Retrofits – TPS3 01 and TPS3 09 Field retrofit within our P1 and our previous S1 distribution panel boards. When your needs change, Siemens TPS gives you the flexibility to retrofit Siemens panels with internal surge protection replicating factory installation.Low Suppressed Voltage Ratings –

Sized based upon geographical region and corresponding thunderstorm activity, these devices are designed to have long operational lives. When a replacement becomes necessary, FirstSurge is equipped with 3-stage diagnostics to properly notify homeowners. The balanced protection and robustness of our FirstSurge units provide assurance to homeowners that their modern homes and appliances are fully protected.Total Home ProtectionToday's modern home is filled with appliances and electronics that require protection from surges. A surge is a brief burst of energy that can enter through a home's power, cable, and telephone lines, causing damage to dishwashers, refrigerators, TVs, computers, and more. Siemens' FirstSurge devices are designed to stop surges before they enter in order to prevent that damage from happening and protect the whole house.Features and BenefitsSurge Current Capacity – FirstSurge offers three different surge protector sizes based upon geographic location and thunderstorm  activity.
                                        3-Stage Diagnostics – When FirstSurge wears out, the protection status LEDs extinguish, an audible alarm beeps, and a red service light flashes to warn the homeowner.
                                        Modes of Protection – The electrical system's primary paired conductor combinations of L-N, L-G, and N-G are directly surge protected.
                                        Balanced VPR Protection – All primary paired conductors are surge protected in a balanced manner with 600V UL1449 VPRs.
                                        Ground Reference Monitoring – GRM diagnostics monitor the health of a home's neutral to ground bond and alert the homeowner if the bond becomes loose, preventing a potential safety issue.Safety – FirstSurge can achieve UL1449 listed 100kA SCCR, one of the highest ratings for residential surge protection.

PRODUCTSPADMOUNT SWITCHGEAR
Scott Engineering, Inc. designs and manufactures a diverse line of free standing, self-supporting pad-mounted switch cabinets. The Scott Engineering SPM (Live-Front) and SPD (Dead-Front) low profile cabinets offer protection and switching in circuit configurations that meet typical requirements. We offer gang-operated switched ways that allow for easy isolation of distribution feeders for switching, repair and maintenance.
Scott Engineering offers the use of air-break switches in our padmount switch cabinets. A “visible break” viewing window is typically provided to see a physical opening in the switch, allowing for safe access to the interior of the cabinet.

SPM Product Line (Live Front)
SPD Product Line (Dead Front)

Our SPD and SPM switchgear is available in 15kV and 25kV voltage classes with 600 amp load interruption capability and meets the requirements of ANSI/IEEE C37.73 and C37.74.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
