Set forth the amount on which the filing fee is calculated and state how it was determined. 


*
Per unit price or other underlying value of transaction computed pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 0-11: In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 0-11(c), the filing fee of
$2,829,910.77 was determined by multiplying 0.0001364 by the aggregate merger consideration of $20,747,146,376.79. The aggregate merger consideration was calculated as the sum of (i) the product of (a) 1,781,176,938 outstanding shares of
common stock (including shares subject to restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock) as of March 25, 2013 to be acquired in the merger, multiplied by (b) the per share merger consideration of $13.65, plus (ii) the product
of (x) 25,482,624 shares of common stock underlying outstanding employee stock options with an exercise price of $13.65 or less, multiplied by (y) $6.46, representing the difference between the $13.65 per share merger consideration and the
$7.19 weighted average exercise price of such options.
