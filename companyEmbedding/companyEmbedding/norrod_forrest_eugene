 Forrest Norrod Joins AMD as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Business


SubHeadingHTML


					SUNNYVALE, Calif. 
					10/27/2014
				

ContentMain1​AMD (NYSE: AMD) today announced that Forrest Norrod (49) has joined the company as senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (EESC) business group, reporting to President and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. Norrod will be responsible for managing all aspects of strategy, business management, engineering, and sales for AMD’s EESC business. He replaces Dr. Su, who has held the position on an interim basis since July. “Forrest is an industry veteran whose strong track record of establishing and growing businesses strengthens our leadership team,” said Dr. Su. “Forrest’s unique combination of engineering, business management and technical expertise at both the chip and system level make him ideally suited to lead AMD into an expanded set of markets where our differentiated technology assets provide a competitive advantage.” Norrod most recently was vice president and general manager of Dell’s server business, driving the business to market share leadership in several key geographies and markets. Prior to that role, he led the creation of Dell’s first internal startup focused on the hyper-scale datacenter market as the vice president and general manager, Data Center Solutions (DCS). Norrod held several engineering leadership roles previously at Dell, starting as CTO of Client Products before leading Enterprise Engineering and ultimately having responsibility for all of Dell’s global engineering teams. Prior to Dell, he ran the integrated x86 CPU business at Cyrix and National Semiconductor. Norrod has a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Virginia Tech. He holds 11 US patents in computer architecture, graphics and system design. He is based in Austin, Texas. About AMDAMD (NYSE: AMD) designs and integrates technology that powers millions of intelligent devices, including personal computers, tablets, game consoles and cloud servers that define the new era of surround computing. AMD solutions enable people everywhere to realize the full potential of their favorite devices and applications to push the boundaries of what is possible. For more information, visit www.amd.com.
