          Although I had a degree in Biology and was working as a government contractor, in 2008 I started my Arbonne business because I understood what a smart business it was. Where else would I find amazing tax benefits, trips to tropical places, a company that would let me earn a white Mercedes, discounts on amazing health and wellness products, and no glass ceiling???                    But it wasn't until 2013 when my "secure" traditional job was no longer secure that I followed Arbonne's business model, and I never looked back! In just a year I was able to earn a trip to Los Cabos and will my business to my family all while building a second stream of income!! But even more amazing is that I get to pour myself into the lives of other people, helping them get healthy, helping them feel good about themselves, helping them build a second stream of income!                    Arbonne has been the vehicle to help me become the person God has created me to be. This business will change your life! If you would like more information about this opportunity please feel free to contact me! I'm so crazy grateful it is changing my life and I truly believe this journey will change yours too!

BIO

   My name is Karyn Smith and I teach the Opportunity 13 community based instruction transition unit.  I am married with four children, two step children, three grandchidren, and two dogs.  I began my career in special education in Stuttgart, Germany as a classroom aide.  I pursued my education in various schools as my husband was transferred from base to base, including University of Maryland, European Division, Armstrong State College of Savannah, Georgia, and Edison State College.  My family and I returned to Ohio in 1993 and I finished my Bachelors in Education at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  While attending school and raising my children I also worked as a residential caregiver for a young adult with severe behavior maladaptations.  I was trained in the 'Gentle Teaching" method and have used this knowledge to help me gain understanding and empathy for students who use their behavior to communicate their needs and wants.  I also worked for a short time as a Habitation aide in a Intermediate Care Facility for people with mental retardation.  
        I have taught at Tri-Village for 19 years and have furthered my education by earning a Master's Degree in Education from Indiana Wesleyan University.  I continue to strive to stay current in the  special education area and look forward to teaching students how to live their lives as happy and fully engaged adults.
