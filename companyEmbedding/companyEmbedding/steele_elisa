A critical component of leadership is making good decisions—the uncertain environment and velocity of business change create constant pressure for timely and effective decision-making. Jive CEO Elisa Steele will address this topic during a panel at the exclusive G100 Women’s Leadership Acceleration Spring 2017 Forum on Thursday, June 15, from 1:15 – 2:00 p.m. at the Parc 55 Hotel in San Francisco.
Elisa will be joined onstage by Helen Wesley, CFO of ENMAX, and Maggie Wilderotter, the former CEO of Frontier Communications and panel moderator. The session will dig into how to understand hidden biases that influence decisions, the role of judgement when one doesn’t have all the information but needs to make a call, and how to harness the power of an organization to improve the decision-making process.
