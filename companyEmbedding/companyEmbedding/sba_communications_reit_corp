SBA Communications: Data, Towers, And NOLs - SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»SBA Communications: Data, Towers, And NOLsMar.11.17 | About: SBA Communications (SBAC) Long-Short Value Long/short equity, value, special situationsSummarySBA Communications is in the process of converting to a REIT structure.SBA Communications has $1.1B of NOLs that it plans to use to offset REIT taxable income allowing it to eliminate REIT distributions until 2020.SBA Communications is the cheapest Tower REIT with the most upside and is about to lap issues it had with the loss of Sprint revenues in 2016.SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) is a leading wireless communications infrastructure company, often referred to as a Tower REIT or Tower Company because its main assets are Cell Phone Towers. SBA is one of three public Tower REITs that operate mainly in the United States. American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) are the other two which are both structured as REITs. SBA was originally structured as a corporation and is currently converting to a REIT structure like its two peers. The company recently completed an internal merger to allow it to file for REIT status. The CEO discussed the REIT conversation status on the recent earnings call, in which he called the final step of filling the 2016 tax return "a formality," and that it has been "functionally operating as a REIT since prior to 2016." The company has a tremendous amount of NOLs estimated at $1.1B per its latest 10-K. These NOLS are due to years of capital investment and net income losses as it built its tower portfolio. These net income losses are due to high depreciation relative to gross margins. As some of SBA's tower assets are beginning to become fully depreciated, the company has started to post a positive net income. This was the impetus for the REIT conversion, which will help the company reduce taxes like its peers going forward. With this REIT structure change, there are some interesting implications on capital investment and NOLs that I discuss below. Business Segments 


 SBA operates two business segments, Site Leasing and Site Development. Site leasing is the asset based part of the business that leases towers and other locations to the major telecom companies in which they install their cells. Within the Site Leasing segment, the company breaks out its domestic and international businesses. Site Development is a consulting and construction business that helps third parties assess and build towers. Site Development is a services business. The Site Leasing Business is a very attractive business for a few reasons. First, due to zoning restrictions and permitting on Towers in the United States (and most OECD countries) individual towers have a high locational value. This means that within cities there are a limited number of towers that can be built. In a zoning constrained environment, each tower has more value especially in densely populated areas. In mainly foreign countries (i.e. Brazil, India, and Developing Nations) these zoning restrictions are not as stringent, anyone can basically build a tower anywhere they want. This is why towers in the US and most OECD countries have a higher long term moat than towers in many international markets. Towers in developing countries may have better economics now due to the fact that demand for them outpaces supply, but without zoning laws to prevent new tower builds the long term moat is not as great as in OECD countries. Second, Towers are vital to delivering mobile data to the masses. Telecom companies rely on the tower companies to support their networks. Towers are essential to delivering data because of the physics of spectrum signals, limits on cells, and densities required in urban areas. Most cell phones in the US use what is known as 4G/LTE (it stands for 4th Generation/Long Term Equivalent). Before 4G was 3G and before that was 2G. The spectrum used in 2G to 4G falls within the frequency range between 800 mHz and 3600 mHz. These frequencies have roughly all of the same characteristics when it comes to the distance that each Cell serves. Towers can have either Macrocells or Microcells on them depending on a few factors, but both are required for a diverse strong cellular network. 5G, which will be the next generation of spectrum to be rolled out in 2018/2019, will essentially be the same when it comes to the use case for towers. Basically my point is towers have a very significant long term technological moat which makes them essential for supporting mobile networks and future data needs of societies.
 Capital Allocation and NOLs As I highlighted above SBA has a significant amount of NOLs that will last them for the next few years. REITs must distribute to their stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of the REIT taxable income. REIT taxable income can be offset by NOLs per the IRS tax code on REITs. This is an advantage for SBA when comparing them to the other Tower REITs. American Tower and Crown Castle distributed $993m and $1283m in dividends in the last 12 months. These distributions were made basically at a pre-tax or no tax level (as with all REIT structures), but for investors those distributions are taxed on a personal level. Assuming you owned American Tower or Crown Castle and reinvested all of your dividends into the stock, you would have to pay tax on your dividends received largely as ordinary income. As you are probably aware ordinary income is taxed at your individual tax rate which can now be up to 39.6%. While this difference is small, there is still a material impact on the available capital that SBAC will keep tax free and be able to reinvest into new towers, acquisitions, or purchasing land. How does one value these NOLs then in a REIT structure? The traditional way to values NOLs for a normal company is to take the NOLs amount, guess what years NOLs will be used to shield the company from taxes and then take the tax savings as a cashflow. Based on those cashflows you create a Discounted Cashflow Analysis to determine the current value of the NOLs. An easy shortcut for finding the value of NOLs is to take the total NOLs and multiply by the tax rate, although this slightly overstates the value due to timing of cashflows. So how do you value NOLs for a REIT that essentially doesn't have a tax rate? Let's compare SBAC assuming it has the NOLs versus assuming it doesn't have the NOLS and take the difference. SBA has $1.1B of NOLs. REITs are required to distribute 90% of their Net Income. That means SBAC is able to forego distributing roughly $1B of capital that would have been distributed to shareholders in lieu of these NOLs. So the incremental value of the NOLs is equal to $1B x your personal tax rate, which can be different for each investor. If you are in a high tax bracket, the value should be higher to you than someone in a lower tax bracket.
 Outside of the calculation of value of the NOLs saved on taxes, there is an additional source of value. That $1B of capital that is retained inside SBA instead of distributing it to investors will be reinvested into the company's many high ROE opportunities. The money will be used to purchase more towers, more land, and make acquisitions. That $1B will compound within the corporate structure of SBA. For SBA, $1B will go a long way, as its total assets right now is around $7B. Valuation Tower REITs are difficult to value, largely because their assets have incredibly long tails. Due to the way that depreciation of the towers assets work using Net Income to determine value of Tower REITs makes little sense. To value Tower REITs you need to look at either Funds from Operations (FFO) or Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO), which adjusts for rent increases, capital expenditures, and routine maintenance. 

 SBA has both a better growth profile and a higher Shareholder return than its two competitors going into 2017. American Tower has a much stronger track record of growth over the past 5 years than SBAC, which does make the company also very attractive. The leverage profiles of the three companies are also different, with SBAC having the higher net debt/AFFO of the three. If you are comfortable with the business model and believe that towers will be around for many years to come, as I do, I believe SBAC offers the best return of the three. American Tower would be a close second and offers a more international footprint than SBA with a different leverage ratio and a dividend which is likely more attractive to a conservative investor.

	SBA Communications Corporation is a first choice provider and leading owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in North, Central and South America. By “Building Better Wireless,” SBA generates revenue from two primary businesses - site leasing and site development services.

	In our site leasing business, SBA leases antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. SBA owns and operates over 26,000 towers across North, Central and South America. We build our towers at the request of wireless carriers, leveraging our in-house experience in site acquisition, zoning and construction. Our ability to offer carriers a comprehensive portfolio of communication sites is complementary to our tower ownership business. Currently, SBA manages approximately 5,000 communication site locations on behalf of third-party landlords.

	Through our site development services, SBA offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Our services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting for networks representing all technologies. SBA also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. Our extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.

The New #42 Most Shorted Nasdaq 100 Component: SBA Communications
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 09/30/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the Nasdaq 100 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

SBA Communications Completes Merger In Connection With REIT Conversion






GlobeNewswire



Jan 17, 2017 9:00 AM EST













 




























































 BOCA RATON, Fla., Jan. 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) ("SBA") announced today the completion of the previously announced merger of SBA Communications Corporation with and into SBA Communications REIT Corporation ("SBA REIT"), a wholly owned subsidiary of SBA. SBA completed the merger to facilitate its compliance with the rules governing real estate investment trusts ("REITs") by ensuring the effective adoption of certain charter provisions that implement standard REIT ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to its capital stock. As a result of the merger, shareholders of SBA automatically became shareholders of SBA REIT, which changed its name from "SBA Communications REIT Corporation" to "SBA Communications Corporation" as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 13, 2017, the effective time of the Merger, and succeeded to and continued the business and assumed the obligations of SBA immediately prior to the merger. Shares of SBA Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "SBAC," effective January 17, 2017.  About SBA Communications Corporation  SBA Communications Corporation is a first choice provider and leading owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in North, Central and South America. By "Building Better Wireless," SBA generates revenue from two primary businesses—site leasing and site development services. SBA's primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on its multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts.  Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  This press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements concerning SBA's plans regarding the effects of the adoption of certain charter provisions. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in SBA's business. This information is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factor disclosures contained in SBA's SEC filings, including SBA's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, SBA's second quarter Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016, and SBA's third quarter Form 10-Q filed on November 9, 2016.

SBA Communications Corporation Reports 1st Quarter 2014 Results; Provides 2nd Quarter and Updated Full Year 2014 Outlook

BOCA RATON, Fla., May 1, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SBA Communications Corporation (Nasdaq:SBAC) ("SBA" or the "Company") today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Highlights of the results include:

First quarter over year earlier period:


Site leasing revenue growth of 13%

Tower Cash Flow growth of 21%

Net loss decreased from $22 million to net income of $1 million

Adjusted EBITDA growth of 21%

AFFO Per Share growth of 20%



 "We had an excellent first quarter and expect another good year in 2014," commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Among many highlights in our first quarter, we are particularly pleased with our expense performance which produced industry leading Tower Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA margin results. Year-to-date leasing activity and current backlogs evidence very strong customer activity in all of our markets. As a result, we are able to make sizeable increases in our 2014 Outlook, which increases are driven almost entirely by organic activity. With our recently closed acquisition of 2,007 sites from Oi, Brazil now joins our U.S. and other markets as fully scaled and capable operations, well-positioned to continue to participate in the projected growth of wireless in 
their respective regions. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are both sound, and give us plenty of resources to pursue additional quality portfolio growth opportunities. We believe 2014 will be another year of material growth in AFFO per share for SBA."

 Investing Activities


 During the first quarter of 2014, SBA purchased 2,188 communication sites for $900.6 million in cash, net of currency hedging benefits, which included the March 31, 2014 acquisition of 2,007 communication sites from Oi S.A. in Brazil (the "Oi Acquisition"). SBA also built 57 towers during the first quarter of 2014. As of March 31, 2014, SBA owned or operated 22,263 communication sites, 15,034 of which are located in the United States and its territories, and 7,229 of which are located internationally. In addition, the Company spent $9.3 million to purchase land and easements and to extend lease terms with respect to land underlying its towers. Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2014 were 
$947.5 million, consisting of $4.7 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures (tower maintenance and general corporate) and $942.8 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures net of currency hedging benefits (new tower builds, tower augmentations, acquisitions and related earn-outs, purchasing land and easements, and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of a new headquarters building).


 Subsequent to the first quarter of 2014, the Company acquired 12 towers and related assets and liabilities for aggregate consideration of $8.9 million in cash. The Company has agreed to purchase 59 towers for an aggregate amount of $35.5 million. The Company anticipates that these acquisitions will be consummated by the end of the third quarter of 2014.


 Financing Activities and Liquidity


 SBA ended the first quarter with $6.9 billion of total debt, $363.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments, and $6.5 billion of Net Debt (as defined below). SBA's Net Debt and Net Secured Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA Leverage Ratios were 7.2x and 5.0x, respectively.


 During the first quarter of 2014, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II LLC, obtained a new senior secured Term Loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion that was issued at 99.75% of par value and matures on March 24, 2021 ("2014 Term Loan B"). Net proceeds from the 2014 Term Loan B were used to (1) repay in full the remaining $180.5 million balance of the 2011 Term Loan B, (2) repay in full the remaining $110.0 million balance of the 2012-2 Term Loan B, (3) repay the $390.0 million outstanding balance under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, and (4) pay the cash consideration in connection with the Oi Acquisition. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.


 As of the date of this press release, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the $770 million Revolving Credit Facility, and the amount available based on specified covenants under the facility was $675 million.


 Effective March 17, 2014, the Company elected to settle the principal amount of any conversions on its 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 ("4.0% Notes") in cash and any additional conversion consideration at the conversion rate then applicable in shares of its Class A common stock. Concurrently with the settlement of any converted 4.0% Notes, SBA will settle the associated convertible note hedges and receive an equal number of shares to those issued to the noteholders. As a result, SBA's outstanding share count will not be impacted by the early conversion of these notes under the current settlement election. The Company received conversion notices totaling $259,000 of principal during the first quarter of 2014 and conversion notices totaling $121.3 million of principal subsequent to the end of the first quarter, all of which will settle 
in the second quarter of 2014.


 During the first quarter, SBA did not repurchase any shares of its Class A common stock. The Company currently has $150.0 million of repurchase authorization remaining under its existing $300.0 million stock repurchase program.


 Outlook


 The Company is providing its second quarter 2014 Outlook and updating its Full Year 2014 Outlook for anticipated results. The Outlook provided is based on a number of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable at the time of this press release. Information regarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is set forth below and in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


 The Company's Full Year 2014 Outlook assumes approximately $56.7 million of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue. The 2014 Outlook for site leasing revenue, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO includes an assumed negative impact of $16 million associated with iDEN lease terminations, which from a timing perspective have been assumed to occur on the basis least favorable to SBA pursuant to previously negotiated contractual rights. The 2014 Outlook assumes the acquisitions of only those communication sites under contract at the time of this press release. The Company intends to spend additional capital in 2014 on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, the impact of which is not reflected in the 2014 guidance. The Company's Full Year 2014 Outlook includes new tower builds in the U.S. and internationally of 400 to 420 
towers. The Full Year 2014 Outlook also contemplates approximately $1.3 billion of new financing during 2014 at an estimated annual interest rate of 4.0% with proceeds being used to (i) call the Company's 8.25% Senior Notes in August 2014, and (ii) settle for cash all of the obligations under the Company's 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2014 and the related warrants upon maturity. Finally, the Company's Outlook also assumes an average foreign currency exchange rate of 2.30 Brazilian Reais to 1.0 U.S. Dollar for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures


 The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Site Leasing Segment Operating Profit, Site Development Segment Operating Profit, and Segment Operating Profit Margin; (ii) Cash Site Leasing Revenue; (iii) Tower Cash Flow and Tower Cash Flow Margin; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin; (v) Net Debt, Net Secured Debt, Leverage Ratio, and Secured Leverage Ratio (collectively, our "Non-GAAP Debt Measures"); and (vi) Funds from Operations ("FFO"), Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO"), and AFFO per share.


 We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they provide investors additional tools in understanding our financial performance and condition. Specifically, we believe that:


 (1) Segment Operating Profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments;


 (2) Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow are indicators of the performance of our site leasing operations;


 (3) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses; and


 (4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity.


 In addition, Total Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the calculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement, 8.25% Notes, 5.625% Notes, and 5.75% Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance sheet as determined in accordance with GAAP. 


 We believe that FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share, which are also being used by American Tower Corporation and Crown Castle International (our two public company peers in the communication site industry), provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our core business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had we converted to a REIT. In addition, our FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts or by the other communication site companies as the calculation of these non-GAAP measures requires us to estimate the impact had we converted to a REIT, including 
estimates of the tax provision adjustment to reflect our estimate of our cash taxes had we been a REIT.

	SBA Communications Corporation is a first choice provider and leading owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in North, Central and South America. By “Building Better Wireless,” SBA generates revenue from two primary businesses - site leasing and site development services.

	In our site leasing business, SBA leases antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. SBA owns and operates over 26,000 towers across North, Central and South America. We build our towers at the request of wireless carriers, leveraging our in-house experience in site acquisition, zoning and construction. Our ability to offer carriers a comprehensive portfolio of communication sites is complementary to our tower ownership business. Currently, SBA manages approximately 5,000 communication site locations on behalf of third-party landlords.

	Through our site development services, SBA offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Our services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting for networks representing all technologies. SBA also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. Our extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.
