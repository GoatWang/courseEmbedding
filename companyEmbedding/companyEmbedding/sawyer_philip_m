Testimonials
“I highly recommend the Sawyer Squeeze Filter system.  It’s fast and efficient.  No chemicals.”
Jackie McDonnell Yogi’s Hiking Guides, www.pcthandbook.com“For me though, I was a huge fan of chemicals for quite a while, but decided to give the Squeeze a try, and once I did, I have been hooked. Now, the Squeeze is my method of choice when it comes to water treatment; however, it looks like the Squeeze has been knocked out of its place in exchange for the Mini!”
Chad Poindexter Stick’s, www.sticksblog.com“I’ve been using their Squeeze Filter/Personal Water Bottle Filter for over a year now for climbing, summer ski mountaineering, backpacking, and trail running and have been very pleased so far. These have now been the only two filters that have come with me since last summer 2012.”
Nick Traux On The Mountain, www.nicktruax.com“When all things are considered, the Sawyer Mini Water Filtration System is simply the best overall lightweight filter on the market whether for lightweight backpackers or anyone looking for an inexpensive, lightweight and effective water filter in a very reasonably-sized package.”
James Jolly Green Giant, www.jolly-green-giant.blogspot.com View More Testimonials

“A lifetime of water at hand.”
Our most popular filter just got smaller and lighter. The Sawyer MINI Water Filter is rated to 0.1 micron absolute, weighs only 2 ounces, and filters up to 100,000 gallons!  This award winning system is reliable and easy to use.
The MINI can be attached to the included collapsible drinking pouch, inline on a hydration pack, on a standard soda bottle, or simply use the included drinking straw to drink directly from the water source.  How is that for versatility? Like all Sawyer filters, a proper backwashing can restore up to 98.5% of the filter’s flow rate. That means no expensive cartridges to replace, ever.

&plus;How often should I backwash my filter?We recommend backwashing your filter when you flow rate begins to diminish, before prolonged storage, and when you are ready to start using your filter again.  Backwashing your filter after storage is a great way to re-wet the filters and restore the flow rate before use.
&plus;Does the Sawyer filter remove taste, chemicals and heavy metals from water?Taste
The Sawyer filter removes taste that comes from bacteria, dirt, and green matter.
Chemicals
The Sawyer filter does NOT remove iron, sulfur, other chemicals, or simple compounds. Taste can be masked by using flavor additives like Gatorade or crystal light (filter needs to be cleaned immediately after using them).
Heavy Metals
The Sawyer filters are not made with charcoal. While other portable filters have charcoal, they lack in amount of media and adequate dwell time. Therefore, they only remove small amounts of heavy metals, pesticides, etc. (when used in real life applications). Try using better sources of water, if possible.
&plus;Do you have more information about Sawyer’s Label Claims and Warranties?We have independent lab tests using EPA protocols and information about our filters and their warranties available on our Downloads Page.
&plus;Filter CompatibilityThe Sawyer Squeeze Filter
The Sawyer Squeeze Filter can be used in conjunction with a hydration pack. Please see video Sawyer Squeeze with Hydration Pack using Inline Adapter and Sawyer Squeeze with Fast Fill Adapters.
The Sawyer Squeeze Filter with Water Bottles
The Sawyer Squeeze Filter can also be used on water bottles when you are unsure whether or not it is safe to drink the water.
The Sawyer Inline Filter
This convenient filter can be used as an inline filter on a hydration pack, a pre-filter for an existing pump system, with the provided faucet adapter, or with a gravity bag.
&plus;How fast should the water come out of my filter?Flow rates
Flow rates vary depending on how clean the filter is and how well you cleaned the filter. Altitude also affects the flow rates (the higher you go the slower the flow. Also, the PointZEROTWO™ filter flows much slower that the Point ONE.
&plus;How do I care for my filter during freezing weather?Before initial wetting
Filter is safe from freezing temperatures if it has never been wetted.
After initial wetting
While there is no definitive way to tell if a filter has been damaged due to freezing, Sawyer recommends replacing your filter if you suspect that it has been frozen.
During trips
If you are in freezing temperatures, we recommend that you store your filter in your pocket or close to your person so that your body heat can prevent freezing. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR A FROZEN FILTER.

Philip Ayer Sawyer Biography from the Archives of askART
 

A landscape and figure painter who depicted many Southwest subjects and also a muralist, Philip Sawyer was born in Chicago and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, at Purdue University, and the Yale School of Fine Arts. In Paris, he studied with Leon Bonnat, and after 1900 lived much of the time in France.
He was active in Detroit, Michigan as a member of the Society of Independent Artists. He completed a mural titled “Scenes from Chicago History (1915), which is in the restored (1998) auditorium of the Joseph E. Gary School, 3740 West 32st Street in Chicago. An illustration of this mural and biographical material may be found in Mary Lackritz Gray’s, “A Guide to Chicago’s Murals”. The central panel of the mural is titled “Progress”. (Perry)
In the early 1900s, Sawyer traveled in the Southwest, and paintings from these travels include Indian figures and landscapes in Arizona at the Hopi and Navajo reservations.  He also stopped to visit J.L. Hubbell at his trading post at Ganado, Arizona.  His paintings are in the Santa Fe Railway Collection. In the 1930s, he lived in Tiskilwa, Illinois, and in the 1940s in Clearwater, Florida where he died.
