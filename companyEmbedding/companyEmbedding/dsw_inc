About Dsw Inc.

   DSW (short for Designer Shoe Warehouse) sells discounted brand-name footwear. DSW stores sell shoes for style-conscious men, women, and kids through 468 stores in 40-plus US states and Puerto Rico, as well as online at dsw.com. DSW stores average 21,000 square feet and stock about 21,500 pairs of dress, casual, and athletic shoes, as well as a complementary array of handbags, hosiery, and accessories. The company also operates about 385 leased departments inside stores operated by other retailers. The discount footwear giant is dipping its toe in the luxury shoe market. DSW was founded in 1969.
  
Operations

   In addition to its historically-fast-growing retail operation, DSW operates leased departments inside more than 275 stores operated by Stein Mart, 100-plus Gordmans stores, and one Frugal Fannie's Fashion Warehouse store. Leased departments accounted for 6% of DSW's fiscal 2016 (ended January) sales.
  

   The company's reportable segments are DSW (which includes DSW stores and dsw.com), and the Affiliated Business Group (ABG). ABG partners with multi-category retailers to develop strategies and business models for targeted shoe assortments.
  
Geographic Reach

   Fast-growing DSW operates shoe stores in 42 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Its two largest markets are California and Texas, home to about 18% of its stores.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company sells through its stores and online website.
  

   DSW's marketing costs were $70.1 million, $59.9 million, and $56.2 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   The company has seen an upward trend in revenues since 2012.
  

   In fiscal 2016 net sales increased by 5% due to higher DSW and ABG segment sales.
  

   DSW segment sales rose as the result of an increase in digitally demanded sales and non-comparable sales growth attributable to stores opened in fiscal 2014, as well as 37 net new DSW stores in fiscal 2015.
  

   The increase in sales for ABG was primarily the result of comparable sales growth and the net addition of eight new shoe departments in fiscal 2015.
  

   In fiscal 2016 DSW's net income decreased by $17.26 million (11%) compared to 2015 due to increased operating expenses and a loss from town shoes. Higher operating expenses were driven by increased marketing expenses and home office overhead.
  

   Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 23% due to a change in accounts payable and inventories.
  
Strategy

   The historically fast-growing company has returned to a more aggressive growth strategy after a hiatus during the deep recession and its aftermath. (DSW was a relatively-strong performer throughout the recession, which left many other retailers struggling with falling sales.)
  

   DSW targets fashion-focused men and women from wide-ranging socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. It looks to capture these shoppers by offering a broad selection of in-season styles at prices that rival the sales deals found in department stores.
  

   The company's growth strategy is to continue to strengthen its position as a leading footwear and accessories retailer by expanding into new markets with the appropriate banners and store format, extending its customer reach through new categories, and acquiring other companies. It also plans to continue expanding its physical and digital presence in relevant markets through existing and new formats, investing in infrastructure, and using its financial strength to invest in key initiatives.
  

   The company opened 40 DSW stores and closed 3 DSW stores in fiscal 2015. It planned to open 30 to 35 DSW stores in fiscal 2016 and an additional 15 to 20 DSW stores in each of the following three to five years, with the primary focus on power strip centers. It also plans to reposition existing stores as opportunities arise.
  

   In addition to store growth, DSW is enhancing its omni-channel capabilities. It expanded its drop ship program, made previously store-only products available online, and increased availability of its accessories online.
  

   In fiscal 2014 the chain opened 30 new stores, including its first in Canada, with an ultimate goal of 450 to 500 stores. The company entered the Canadian market in spring 2014 with the purchase of a minority stake in that country's largest footwear retailer, Town Shoes, for about $62 million. Under the terms of the deal, DSW has the right to purchase the rest of Town Shoes after four years.
  

   The discount shoe retailer has also tested the luxury area, with a test (characterized by the company as "unsuccessful") of an expanded luxury assortment online. DSW's future approach to luxury sales will depend on its ability to buy products that will allow it to at least break even.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In February 2016 DSW agreed to acquire Ebuys, a leading e-commerce off-price footwear and accessories retailer with a presence in North America, Europe, Australia. and Asia. The deal supports DSW's efforts to grow its market share within footwear and accessories domestically and internationally. The purchase price includes an upfront payment of $62.5 million as well as future payments contingent on the performance of Ebuys, Inc.
  

   In May 2014 DSW entered Canada with the purchase of a 44% stake in that country's largest footwear retailer, Town Shoes, for about $62 million. Under the terms of the deal, DSW has the right to purchase the rest of Town Shoes after four years. Town Shoes operates 182 locations across Canada and reported sales of C$291 million. DSW's initial stake provides 50% voting control and board representation.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DSW Inc. (NYSE:   DSW), a leading branded footwear and accessories retailer, announced financial results for the thirteen week period ended April 29, 2017, compared to the thirteen week period ended April 30, 2016.








Roger Rawlins, Chief Executive Officer stated, "First quarter sales were challenging, but trends improved during the quarter with comps turning positive in April. As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management."
First Quarter Operating Results

Sales increased 1.4% to $691.1 million, including $22.3 million of revenues from Ebuys. 
Comparable sales decreased 3.0% compared to last year's 1.6% decrease. 
Reported gross profit decreased by 180 bps, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favorable sourcing costs. 
Reported operating expenses improved by 40 bps, due to tighter expense management. 
Reported net income was $23.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, including pre-tax charges totaling $4.1 million, or $0.04 per share, related to the acquisition of Ebuys, restructuring costs and foreign exchange loss assumed in the process of pre-funding the upcoming Town Shoes acquisition. 
Adjusted net income was $25.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. 

First Quarter Balance Sheet Highlights

Cash, short-term and long-term investments totaled $254 million compared to $238 million in the first quarter last year. 
Inventories were $575 million compared to $563 million for the same period last year. On a cost per square foot basis, inventories declined by 2.6%.

Fiscal 2017 Annual Outlook
The Company reiterated its full year outlook for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per diluted share.

 (1) 
 Related to the step-up of the value of Ebuys' inventory, which is recorded in gross profit. 






 (2) 
 Related to costs associated with the acquisition of Ebuys and the amortization expense associated with $38.7 million of acquired intangibles, which are recorded within operating expenses. 






 (3) 
 The Company agreed to pay additional amounts to Ebuys contingent upon achievement of certain negotiated goals. The Company has recognized a liability for this contingent consideration based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition-date fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized as an adjustment to income from operations. 






 (4) 
 Relates to the Company's expense management initiative as recorded within operating expenses. 






 (5) 
 Relates to foreign exchange loss on Canadian dollar investments related to the funding of our upcoming Town Shoes acquisition. 




Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to earnings per share and net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), for purposes of evaluating operating performance, the Company uses adjusted earnings per share and net income, which adjust for the effects of acquisition costs and the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets related to the Ebuys acquisition, restructuring costs related to the Company's expense management initiative, as well as foreign currency loss on Canadian dollar investments. The unaudited reconciliation of adjusted results should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that this non-GAAP information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate the Company's operating performance, when reviewed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP statements. These amounts are not determined in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be used exclusively in evaluating the Company's business and operations.

DSW/DSW Inc. is a footwear retailer, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
History[edit]
DSW opened its first store in July 1991, located in Dublin, Ohio. In 1998, Value City Department Stores, Inc. purchased DSW. In December 2004, Retail Ventures consolidated several of the newly-defunct Value City's subsidiary brands. Until July 5, 2005, DSW operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Retail Ventures; afterward, Retail Ventures retained 60% of DSW, Inc.'s outstanding shares.[2]




DSW Shoes, Green Oak Village Place in Brighton, Michigan


Months prior to the initial public offering (IPO), DSW changed its name from Shonac Corporation, to DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse), Incorporated.
In 2005, DSW experienced massive data theft, resulting in the loss of 1.4 million credit card transactions and an unknown amount of customer data.[3]
In 2006, the IT departments of Retail Ventures and DSW were split-off into a separate company called Brand Technology Services (BTS).
In early 2008, DSW launched its e-commerce website.[4]
The Audrey Brooke, Kelly & Katie, Lulu Townsend, and Poppie Jones-branded shoes and purses sold by DSW, are actually private-label brands created by DSW.
DSW announced its merger with Retail Ventures in February 2011.

DSW Coupon: DSW Sale - Up To 60% Off Pumps & Heels | GrouponSearch GrouponZip Code, Neighborhood, City SearchShop dsw.com 17Coupons AvailableFilter byAll Coupons (17)Promo Codes (1)Sales (16)In-Store Offers (3)Coupon AlertsNever miss a great DSW coupon and get our best coupons every week! About DSWBy using these DSW Shoes coupons, you can walk away with new designer pumps, sandals, and flats. Famous brands such as Steve Madden and Dr. Martens mingle with proprietary labels such as Lulu Townsend and Poppie Jones. While ladies pair their new shoes with handbags, men hunt down everything from athletic shoes to dressy wingtips. Start shopping by grabbing a DSW Shoes coupon.Once known as Designer Shoe Warehouse, the footwear emporium now goes simply by its abbreviated moniker, DSW. The first of its stores opened in Ohio, back in the early ‘90s, and has since spread to more than 350 stores across the country. In addition to shopping at DSW’s expansive locations, customers can peruse even more kicks on its website’s ever-changing stock at dsw.com. If you become a member, you can also earn points toward rewards certificates whenever you shop. And now thanks to these DSW Shoes coupons from Groupon Freebies, you can stack the shoe boxes you bring home even higher.In addition to curating designer footwear, DSW also tries to find ways to sell shoes in a more sustainable manner. The company’s code of conduct requires vendors to ensure safe and equitable factory and working conditions for their employees. And to make sure they comply, DSW performs audits of its vendors to rout out any unethical behavior. When it isn’t keeping its house in order, DSW helps its local communities through a program it’s created called Shoe Lovers Care. This initiative had donated thousands of dollars—and volunteered thousands of hours—to support nonprofit organizations.A bad pair of shoes can give you blisters, make your feet ache, and convince you to send money to that Nigerian Prince who emailed you.

DSW/DSW Inc. is a footwear retailer, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
History[edit]
DSW opened its first store in July 1991, located in Dublin, Ohio. In 1998, Value City Department Stores, Inc. purchased DSW. In December 2004, Retail Ventures consolidated several of the newly-defunct Value City's subsidiary brands. Until July 5, 2005, DSW operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Retail Ventures; afterward, Retail Ventures retained 60% of DSW, Inc.'s outstanding shares.[2]




DSW Shoes, Green Oak Village Place in Brighton, Michigan


Months prior to the initial public offering (IPO), DSW changed its name from Shonac Corporation, to DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse), Incorporated.
In 2005, DSW experienced massive data theft, resulting in the loss of 1.4 million credit card transactions and an unknown amount of customer data.[3]
In 2006, the IT departments of Retail Ventures and DSW were split-off into a separate company called Brand Technology Services (BTS).
In early 2008, DSW launched its e-commerce website.[4]
The Audrey Brooke, Kelly & Katie, Lulu Townsend, and Poppie Jones-branded shoes and purses sold by DSW, are actually private-label brands created by DSW.
DSW announced its merger with Retail Ventures in February 2011.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
