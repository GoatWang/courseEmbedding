Two other terraces run the length of the villa.  The ground floor terrace, outside the indoor living area, is covered and has stunning views of the Mediterranean.  The lower, garden floor, terrace is a lovely spot for a beverage and conversation and has access to the garden.The two hundred and seventy square meter villa is tastefully decorated in a subtle beige-pink monochrome throughout creating a sense of peace and tranquility.  High double ceilings in the ground floor rooms and an open concept floor plan offer a feeling of airy spaciousness.  The décor throughout is contemporary with a suggestion of the Provençal style.The living room has comfortable sofas and ottomans centered on a wood slab coffee table and a brick fireplace.  A dining area adjacent to the seating area comfortably holds eight.  The kitchen, large, modern and fully equipped, has a half wall opening on the living/dining area.There are three en-suite bedrooms in Villa Laurie and an additional single bedroom is suitable for staff or a child.Villa Laurie feels like it’s in the country, with its secluded garden and views of the countryside and the sea, but it’s close to all the clubs, restaurants and beaches of St. Tropez. Sit in the sun by the pool at the villa, walk to the beach, or within minutes dine at a favourite beach restaurant in St. Tropez! Read more...About the locationRegionVilla MapRegionSt. TropezReferred to as one of the top five most glamorous vacation spots, St. Tropez has long been known for its beautiful white sand beaches, cultural opportunities, dining venues, nightlife, fashion sense and, of course, as the playground of the rich and famous.The stunning blend of vineyards, pine groves and famed sunshine have inspired works by painters such as Matisse, Bonnard and Seurat.  Cultural opportunities abound and the architecture, history and art are worth a visit in themselves. Provencal cuisine, accompanied by a glass of burgandy or bourdeaux from a local vineyard, makes St. Tropez a gourmands' choice as well.  For families, the laid-back lifestyle, lovely beaches and cultural opportunities make St. Tropez a choice vacation destination.St. Tropez beaches are located along the coast in the Baie de Pampelonne, fronting crystal blue Mediterranean waters. Pampelonne offers several beaches along its five-kilometre shore. Water sports enthusiasts will easily find opportunities for windsurfing, sailing, power boating, jet skiing, water skiing and scuba diving. St. Tropez's harbor is famous for hosting the yachts of the wealthy and celebrated, and St. Tropez is home to several famous regattas. Internationally renowned clubs and hotels abound in the small town. The graceful countryside surrounding St. Tropez hosts a number of luxury villas. Despite its popularity and reputation as a glitzy vacation destination, St. Tropez remains a Provencal village and a wonderful vacation destination for travelers of all stripes. LaCure provides a fabulous selection of private villas to meet the needs of those traveling for romance, for celebrity spotting, for relaxing, for soaking up culture, or for a family vacation.Region Facts:Villa MapView in Google MapsSimilar villas that may interest you Villa Chic 6+1 bedrooms €5,105 - €12,760 /nt Villa Details > Add to wishlist Villa Blanc 6 + 2 bedrooms €3,615 - €7,860 /nt Villa Details > Add to wishlist Villa Sophia 5 bedrooms €3,450 - €4,465 /nt Villa Details > Add to wishlist Villa Chic 6+1 bedrooms €5,105 - €12,760 /nt Villa Details > Add to wishlist Questions?
