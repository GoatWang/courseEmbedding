About Us
Prior to early 2016, Venaxis® was an in vitro diagnostic company that was focused on obtaining clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for and commercializing its blood-based test to serve as an adjunctive test in the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in children, adolescent, and young adults.  The APPY1 Test has not been cleared by the FDA despite our performance of clinical trials, including our pivotal clinical trial for the APPY1 Test, which was completed in early 2014.  The data demonstrated high sensitivity and high negative predictive value (NPV), similar to other adjunctive tests for other conditions currently in use by physicians.
 
The Company is currently evaluating potential strategic alternatives available to it. The Company is in the process of considering the primary criteria it will use as it evaluates a possible strategic path forward. Such criteria will be focused on a path to best enhance shareholder value using all of the Company’s available resources. As a result of the general overall decline in market values over the past several quarters of publicly traded and privately held enterprises, management believes that there may currently be available corporate and product opportunities at potentially attractive terms for an acquirer such as the Company, with its cash and other resources.

AspenBio Pharma
Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results 

AspenBio Advances
Several High Value Late-Stage Human and Animal Bio Pharma Products, Including the First
Blood-based Test for                                                          Human
Appendicitis 

CASTLE ROCK, CO., August 20,
2007  AspenBio Pharma, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: APNB:OB) an
emerging bio-pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel drugs and
diagnostics for animals and humans, reported results for the second quarter ended June 30,
2007. 

Richard Donnelly, AspenBios
president and CEO, said, Recent product development activities demonstrate
substantial progress in the second quarter. We remain confident that 2007 will be a major
inflection point for AspenBio, as we proceed towards achieving key milestones and
delivering on important new products, like our breakthrough appendicitis triage blood
tests, AppyScore and
AppyScreen. 

Mr.
          Donnelly further stated, Following the 2007 second quarter completion of
          the conversion of warrants that increased our cash position to more than $11
          million, we have accelerated development of our key products. This includes making
          important additions to our scientific staff, engaging well known FDA
          consultants, and signing high quality contract manufacturers to advance both the
          appendicitis blood tests and BoviPure FSH products. We continued to see
          positive field trial results for all of our top products. 

Second
          Quarter 2007 Key Highlights 

AppyScore & AppyScreen:
Substantial progress was made in the development of AspenBios breakthrough products;
AppyScore Appendicitis Triage Blood Test for emergency rooms, and its sister product,
AppyScreen (being designed as a point-of-care test for physician offices). Results from
the ongoing 400-patient pre-United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
trials of the AppyScore blood test continue to demonstrate high sensitivity levels of 94%
to 97% in the ability to identify patients with appendicitis. While this pre-FDA trial has
taken longer than originally anticipated to complete, this has allowed us to fine tune
specific aspects of blood collection as well as the practical use of the test in a
hospital clinical setting. The company is currently engaged with multiple hospital sites
for the collection of additional trial samples. 

AspenBio has also commenced initial
steps for the U.S. FDA approval process for AppyScore with the engagement of three widely
recognized FDA device registration consultants to assist with the process. The company
expects an initial meeting with the FDA on the AppyScore Appendicitis Triage Blood Test to
occur within the next thirty to forty-five days. AspenBio has also executed contracts with
FDA-approved diagnostic test manufacturers related to assay development, GMP
manufacturing, and validation of different versions of the first generation AppyScore and
AppyScreen test formats. The on-going 400 patient pre-FDA trial is anticipated to be
completed by the end of September, with an announcement of the data planned shortly after
completion. These activities, if successfully completed, put the first generation of
AppyScore on a timeline for introduction in the United States in 2008. 

BoviPure FSH: AspenBio Pharma
announced in July it had filed and received an INADA file number for BoviPure FSH (bovine
follicle stimulating hormone) to officially start the FDA approval process. Additionally,
in order to facilitate the product advancement, AspenBio also executed a contract with
AppTec Laboratory Services, Inc. (AppTec) for the required GMP manufacturing
and validation of this product. This advancement follows a similar path that commenced in
January for StayBred (a/k/a BoviPure LH, an LH analog for cows),
AspenBios largest market potential, single-chain, reproduction-enhancing drug.

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Venaxis®, Inc. (Nasdaq:   APPY), announced today that it has acquired BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc., ("BiOptix") a Boulder, CO-based privately-held company. BiOptix has developed a proprietary Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance ("E‑SPR") technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions. The technology was developed in conjunction with Dr. John 'Jan' Hall, Adjoint Professor, JILA (University of Colorado), who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2005.








Venaxis acquired as of September 12, 2016, approximately 98% of the voting shares of BiOptix for approximately 14% of the Venaxis post-deal outstanding common shares.
BiOptix offers an affordable and powerful solution for drug discovery scientists that require label-free real-time detection of biomolecular interactions. The BiOptix unique enhanced instrumentation offers precise measurement of kinetics, affinity constants and concentration, proprietary easy-to-use analytical software, and two operating modes for higher throughput and experimental flexibility. 
BiOptix' technology is an ultra-sensitive detection Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) platform which combines high sensitivity with microarray detection capability allowing Pharma and Biotech researchers to understand much earlier in the discovery process whether their target molecules have functionality against the disease targeted. BiOptix' partners with academic research institutions, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and contract research organizations to help make these partners drug development process more effective and productive.
SPR is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chip's gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event. This change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules, kinetic rates and affinity constants.
"We are pleased to announce this acquisition and are excited by the opportunity we believe it represents for shareholders of Venaxis," said Steve Lundy, Chief Executive Officer of Venaxis, Inc. "The newly combined company will benefit from BiOptix technology and market opportunity, combined with Venaxis resources and public listing. The company is expected to initially focus on product improvement initiates and expanding commercialization of BiOptix's 404pi E-SPR product."
Conference Call  Venaxis will host an investor conference call to discuss the transaction on Wednesday, September 14, 2016, at 8:45 a.m. ET. The conference call will be hosted by Steve Lundy, President and CEO of Venaxis, Inc.
A live audio webcast will be accessible via the Investor Relations section of the Venaxis website, www.venaxis.com. Participants and investors may also access the conference call by dialing 1-888-283-6901 (U.S.) or 1-719-457-2506 (Toll – International).
A replay of the call will be available approximately an hour after the end of the conference call on Venaxis' website. To access the webcast, please visit the investor relations section of the Venaxis website at www.venaxis.com.
About Venaxis, Inc.--Venaxis, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostic company which had been focused on the clinical development and commercialization of its CE Marked APPY1 Test, the Company's rapid blood based test for appendicitis.  In 2015, following failure to obtain FDA clearance for the APPY1 Test Venaxis began suspending its limited commercial activities associated with its APPY1 Test and began evaluating strategic alternatives available to the Company, culminating in the acquisition of BiOptix. 
About BiOptix Subsidiary-- BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc., has developed an Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance ("SPR") instrument designed to increase the flexibility and reliability of SPR, in order to address the increasing demand for instruments suitable for a broader range of applications, while offering far greater performance per dollar than other instruments commercially available. BiOptix SPR biosensors shed light on important binding parameters that are crucial for determining whether a biologic or small molecule drug will be efficacious in humans and at what dose a drug should be administered.

(APPY), announced today that following its acquisition of BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc., ("BiOptix") that was announced on September 13, 2016, Venaxis has issued the following letter to its shareholders. The letter is posted on the company's website.Castle Rock, CODear Venaxis Shareholders:On behalf of the Venaxis Board of Directors, I would like to take this opportunity to provide further information regarding our decision to acquire a controlling interest in BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc., including how Venaxis intends to execute on the BiOptix opportunity and return long-term value to all of our shareholders.  I will also take this opportunity to respond to the recent Schedule 13D filings made with the SEC by Mr. Barry Honig. On investor calls over the past twelve to eighteen months, I have described the process employed by the Venaxis Board and management to evaluate potential merger and/or acquisition opportunities.  Our focus has been primarily on companies in the life science space with commercial stage products and services in which we could leverage our assets to maximize long-term value for the Venaxis shareholders. We have further focused on opportunities where the Venaxis capital and public company listing status would also potentially lead to significant value inflection.  Our goal during this process was to evaluate as many high quality opportunities meeting our criteria, as possible while conserving cash.   During this process we extensively interviewed dozens of companies, negotiated with a number of promising targets, and conducted diligence on several companies, including BiOptix.The decision to ultimately acquire BiOptix represented our assessment, after diligence was completed, that the acquisition of BiOptix, including its commercial stage products, represented, in the view of the Board and management, the best opportunity available to Venaxis to create value for our shareholders.  Let me explain why.  First, the market for label-free instrumentation for drug discovery is large and growing, with multiple potential customers, including pharmaceutical companies, life science companies, academic research institutions and contract research organizations.   While we certainly recognize that there are large competitors in this estimated $1 billion market, we believe there is room for BiOptix, which has developed a product with significant performance and cost advantages.  As a smaller company in the space, BiOptix has a significant opportunity to differentiate itself through its science and technical support.   Second, our interviews with BiOptix customers and pipeline prospects, conducted as part of our diligence process, reflected their delight with the BiOptix product, team and approach to the market.   Third, our technical diligence on the BiOptix 404pi product reflected a highly credible team which has developed a solid product platform using technology which is scalable to future high value products.  Finally, the main things BiOptix was missing were the resources needed to fully launch their product and to provide services in the field required to sell and service the 404pi product, and management with proven commercial experience.   It was our assessment of the BiOptix commercial plan that a relatively modest investment in commercialization of the 404pi product could create significant momentum for this commercial stage company.Another major factor the Venaxis Board considered in choosing the BiOptix acquisition was the significant value received for the consideration paid, which was approximately 14% of current Venaxis outstanding stock. No cash was needed to be used in the execution of this transaction.  We believe this provides tremendous value, particularly considering that over $20 million was previously invested to develop the 404pi instrument and bring the product to market.   With no regulatory barriers, such as FDA approval requirements, needed to market the 404pi, our funds will be deployed to grow sales, improve the product and develop next generation systems.  We believe the investment in commercialization will result in a potentially significant return to our shareholders.Read MoreLet me now address the accusations made by Mr. Honig in his recent Schedule 13D filings:Mr. Honig asserts that the BiOptix transaction was an "inside job" which we executed quickly and with limited diligence.     As mentioned earlier, Venaxis evaluated many companies before choosing BiOptix.  Our first significant meeting with BiOptix was in April 2016 and we carefully conducted diligence on BiOptix (and other companies) after that.  While Mr. Jeffrey Peierls, who is a long-term investor in Venaxis with minimal holdings and a larger investor in BiOptix, made the initial introduction, Venaxis evaluated the business and made the decision to acquire BiOptix separate of any influence by Mr. Peierls. As stated in the attached letter, Mr. Peierls fervently objects to the unfounded accusations of Mr. Honig. Mr. Honig asserts that the decision to acquire BiOptix was made to entrench the Venaxis management team and Board.   While many of the opportunities we evaluated did involve potential transactions where the Venaxis management and Board would not have been in control after the transaction, we did not select the BiOptix transaction to entrench the Venaxis Board and management team.  Instead, we believe it is an advantage to the combined company that the skills and experience of our management team and Board provide additional assets to the combined company.  We were willing to, and did, consider potential transactions where such control would not have been present, the Strand transaction (which was announced but ultimately terminated) is an example.  During our evaluation process, Mr. Honig brought to my attention several companies which fell into this category, including some where he owned a stake or had a relationship with the potential target.  As Mr. Honig is well aware, we were open to looking at companies he brought forward and we met with the management teams and conducted preliminary diligence on two of these companies during the process.  After our process, we determined that the BiOptix transaction, which can use the skills of the current management team and Board of Venaxis to complement and enhance the BiOptix team, coupled with the value acquired for the consideration paid, and the ability to deploy our capital and public company experience in a large potential market for a commercial-ready product created potential long-term value for all of our shareholders.  As I mentioned in the investor call on September 14, 2016, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is evaluating the skills, qualifications and experience of one or more of the legacy BiOptix directors, and we may add to our Board to further enhance the experience and background of our Board members in the relevant industries.  Mr. Honig asserts that I withheld "negative information" about BiOptix from the Venaxis Board.  This is not an accurate statement.  My obligation as CEO is to keep our Board informed of all relevant information and I have consistently done so as the CEO of Venaxis.  Mr. Honig has no grounds to impugn my personal integrity and our management team has consistently provided, and our Board has consistently been vigilant in gathering, all relevant facts before making decisions in the exercise of their fiduciary duties for the good of all Venaxis shareholders.I find it unfortunate that Mr. Honig has decided to take an adversarial course of action against Venaxis.  Since he became a significant shareholder in the spring of 2016, I have met with and spoken with him on many occasions and have been open to his thoughts and ideas.  When he determined that he wanted to propose a new slate of directors recently, I told him that any shareholder could, of course, follow the Board-approved process to propose Board candidates.  The Venaxis Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is evaluating the candidates he has proposed.   Again, the Board is committed to serving as fiduciaries for all of the shareholders of Venaxis.In closing, we are excited about moving forward and building value for the Venaxis shareholders through developing and growing the exciting BiOptix opportunity.   I sincerely request your support as we move forward.Very best regards……Stephen LundyStephen Lundy President and Chief Executive Officer Attached letter from E. Jeffrey Peierls, a Venaxis shareholderE. Jeffrey Peierls Golden, CO 80401September 15, 2016Stephen T. Lundy Chief Executive Officer Venaxis, Inc. 1585 South Perry Street Castle Rock, CO 80104Re:       Barry Honig's scurrilous letter of September 14thDear Stephen:A friend spotted Mr. Honig's Schedule 13D/A filing this afternoon. I was shocked to see what I consider defamatory allegations that he made against you and the rest of management. And I strongly resent the implication by him that I somehow colluded with you to protect your jobs.  I'm sure that you are aware that Honig's call for a special meeting was never mentioned to me. During our negotiations over the BiOptix acquisition, I did hear that Honig was acquiring a significant ownership in Venaxis stock, and that he was urging Venaxis to enter into transactions that the Board determined were not in the best interest of the company's shareholders.  I did not realize, however, that he was a person who would launch a personal attack against you when you turned down his proposals.Mr. Honig has implied that my ownership in Venaxis stock created the perception that the BiOptix acquisition was not done on an arms' length basis. To the contrary, my beneficial ownership, including a modest number of out-of-the-money warrants was in the range of 3% to 4% of Venaxis' outstanding shares before the acquisition. That was apparently far less than his ownership when he was pushing his proposals.If Venaxis shareholders contact you, you might wish to mention my strong preference to receive Venaxis shares for my ownership in BiOptix during our negotiations, rather than being cashed out. I strongly disagree with Mr. Honig's allegations regarding the value of BiOptix' business. I feel that the combination of BiOptix' technology and Venaxis' resources has the potential to make the shares of Venaxis that I received considerably more valuable over a reasonable period of time.Please accept my sympathy for being attacked so unfairly. And my best wishes as you build a successful business.Best regards,Jeff Peierls*   *   *   *   *About the Company-- Venaxis, Inc., through its operating subsidiary BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc., has developed an Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance ("SPR") instrument designed to increase the flexibility and reliability of SPR, in order to address the increasing demand for instruments suitable for a broader range of applications, while offering far greater performance per dollar than other instruments commercially available.

Here is what the hayseeds believe Donald Trump is going to do.:

1. Destroy the federal government as we know it.
2. Get rid of a bunch of minorities.
3. Get rid of Obamacare and watch the poor die. My previously unaffordable insurance is down to just $85/month.  My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. Under Trump, healthcare will be $500/month or more.
4. Make the lives of poor kids, the sick, and the elderly worse than they already are.
5. Drop a bunch of bombs on some colored people in some country somewhere.
6. Cut taxes on the rich.

It's not a partisan issue, as he's not really a Republican, it's the person. He's a narcissist who can't abide criticism and has no empathy for others, a petty and vindictive man.

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Jan. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Venaxis®, Inc. (Nasdaq:   APPY), announced today that it has entered into a series of agreements for a transaction with Strand Life Sciences Private Limited (Strand LS) and its shareholders.  Strand LS is a privately-held, global genomics and bioinformatics company. Strand LS operates clinical reference labs in the US through its wholly owned subsidiary Strand Genomics, Inc., (Strand U.S.) and directly in India, providing testing and lab services in India and other world-wide markets.  Strand LS has commercialized a next generation sequencing (NGS) based, targeted, multi-gene, pan-cancer diagnostic panel in select international markets and has engaged in initial commercialization activities in the United States.   
Assuming participation by 100% of the Strand LS shareholders, the effect of the transaction will be that Strand LS shareholders and the employees and directors who are option-holders in Strand LS will own directly and beneficially approximately 68% of the combined enterprise and the current shareholders of Venaxis will own approximately 32%. Due to Indian tax and financial regulations, the transaction is being structured as purchases, by Venaxis, of the Strand LS shares from the Strand LS shareholders, followed by an immediate re-investment of those sale proceeds, by the Strand LS shareholders, into Venaxis Common Stock. 
To comply with certain long-term holding period requirements under Indian tax law, the transaction is expected to be completed in two closings.  The first closing will occur upon receipt of the necessary approvals from the Venaxis shareholders, receipt of all other required approvals and satisfaction of identified closing conditions.  The second closing will occur approximately six months later. At each closing, Venaxis will enter into resale registration rights agreements with the Strand LS shareholders participating in such closing.  The boards of each company have unanimously approved the transaction, however this transaction is subject to Venaxis shareholder approval.
At the first closing, Venaxis will own a majority of the shares of Strand LS, will change its name to Strand Life Sciences, and will change its NASDAQ trading symbol. As part of the first closing, following Venaxis shareholder approval, a Venaxis subsidiary will enter into an asset purchase agreement with Strand U.S. in which it will acquire substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Strand U.S. in exchange for cash consideration paid to Strand U.S.  
Advancing to the execution of the agreements with Strand LS, its shareholders and Strand U.S. represents the outcome of an extensive strategic process initiated by Venaxis in early 2015.  Venaxis has also commenced, and expects to continue to attempt to locate a partner or other third-party interested in advancing development and or commercial activities of the Venaxis appendicitis portfolio. Aligning Strand Life Sciences' proven technological expertise in genomic profiling, bioinformatics and data curation with Venaxis' financial resources, NASDAQ public listing and key management personnel provides an opportunity for Strand Life Sciences to continue to commercialize its global business model towards what is believed to be a valuable enterprise for the combined shareholders.  
Following approval by the Venaxis shareholders and satisfaction of the other closing conditions, at the first closing, Dr. Vijay Chandru, the co-founder and current Executive Chairman of Strand LS, will serve as Executive Chairman of the combined company's Board of Directors, Steve Lundy will become the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and Jeff McGonegal will continue as CFO.
