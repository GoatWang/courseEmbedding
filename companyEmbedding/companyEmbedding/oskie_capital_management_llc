Marcato Capital Management and Oskie Capital Management Outline Potential Value Creation Strategy for Lear Corporation | Business Wire


























































Marcato Capital Management and Oskie Capital Management Outline 
      Potential Value Creation Strategy for Lear Corporation




Send Letter to Board of Directors of Lear Highlighting Potential 
      Value-Creating Initiatives and Concerns about Company’s Valuation






February 12, 2013 08:02 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Marcato Capital Management LLC (“Marcato”) and Oskie Capital Management 
      LLC (“Oskie”) (together with their affiliated investment funds, “the 
      Group”), announced today that they have sent a letter to the Board of 
      Directors of Lear Corporation (NYSE: LEA) (“Lear” or “the Company”) 
      outlining concerns around the Company’s valuation, describing the 
      Group’s ideas for potential value-creating initiatives and reiterating 
      the Group’s interest in meeting with members of the Board.
    

      The full text of the letter follows:

            Telephone Number 646-450-0095
          












           
        



      February 12, 2013
    



          Mr. Henry Wallace, Chairman of the Board
        



          Mr. Matthew J. Simoncini, President, Chief Executive Officer and 
          Director

          Mr. Donald L. Runkle
        



          Mr. Gregory C. Smith, Audit Committee Chairman

          21557 Telegraph Road
        



          Southfield, MI 48033
        



           
        



      Dear Members of the Board of Directors,
    

      Investment funds affiliated with Marcato Capital Management and Oskie 
      Capital Management are significant stockholders of Lear Corporation (the 
      “Company”), with holdings together representing beneficial ownership of 
      approximately 5.6 percent of Lear’s outstanding common equity. We share 
      the view expressed in the Company’s press release of February 7, 2013 
      that the Company is undervalued, and we see what we believe to be a 
      serious discrepancy between Lear’s improved operating performance and 
      business prospects and its current market valuation. It is our view that 
      this discount is directly linked to a questionable capital allocation 
      strategy by the Board. Specifically, we believe the Company’s current 
      undervaluation reflects investors’ distaste for the Company’s practice 
      of stockpiling an increasing net cash balance, along with concern that 
      the Company may be willing to make costly acquisitions or invest in 
      other low-return projects at a time when the repurchase of Lear’s 
      undervalued stock would be far more accretive to the long-term equity 
      value of the Company.
    

      It is therefore no surprise to us that Lear’s stock is trading both at a 
      significant discount to its peers, and well below its long-run 
      historical multiple of 5.5X EBITDA.
    

      It is our contention that the Company’s recent announcement – to 
      accelerate the pace of its existing stock repurchase program and raise 
      its dividend – is insufficient. Simply put, we view Lear as dramatically 
      overcapitalized. With net cash of almost 1x EBITDA, we believe Lear is 
      approximately 2x full turns of leverage below the average of a group of 
      its peers – despite Lear’s lower capital intensity, better pension 
      liability position, favorable tax advantages and higher free cash flow 
      conversion. Further, Lear’s large cash balance has the effect, we 
      believe, of increasing the Company’s equity value, thereby artificially 
      inflating the Company’s P/E multiple and distorting the value of the 
      core enterprise.
    

      The Board’s choices regarding capital allocation appear parsimonious and 
      are even more disappointing in light of the positive operational 
      progress the management team has made during and since emerging from 
      Chapter 11 reorganization. The Company is now more diversified by 
      geographical end-market and customer mix, and with its strong 
      competitive position in its core seating business and a lower fixed cost 
      base, we believe the Company is well positioned to generate 
      significantly improved margins for a given level of production.
    

      We note that the Board has de minimis ownership of the Company’s 
      shares.
    

      All of this gives us serious concerns about the current Board’s sense of 
      urgency and alignment of interests with the Company’s owners. We are 
      aware that our concerns are shared by a number of other large 
      stockholders, and are of the impression that there has been little 
      action taken, despite these concerns having been voiced directly to 
      members of the Board on multiple occasions in the past. Accordingly, we 
      believe that it is important to add new Board members who will bring 
      focus and urgency to the implementation of potential value-creating 
      initiatives, including:
    


        The immediate commencement of a $2 billion share repurchase program to 
        both take advantage of the current valuation discount, and establish a 
        more appropriate capital structure in-line with other prudently 
        capitalized industry participants; and
      

        A review of the Company’s growth capital expenditure budget and 
        acquisition and divestiture strategy, to ensure that stockholder 
        capital is being directed to those areas that offer the highest 
        possible long-term return.
      


      We reiterate that we are interested in having a constructive dialogue 
      with Mr. Wallace, Mr. Simoncini and the other directors regarding this 
      positive program for value creation.
    




            Sincerely,

      It is our contention that the Company’s recent announcement – to 
      accelerate the pace of its existing stock repurchase program and raise 
      its dividend – is insufficient. Simply put, we view Lear as dramatically 
      overcapitalized. With net cash of almost 1x EBITDA, we believe Lear is 
      approximately 2x full turns of leverage below the average of a group of 
      its peers – despite Lear’s lower capital intensity, better pension 
      liability position, favorable tax advantages and higher free cash flow 
      conversion. Further, Lear’s large cash balance has the effect, we 
      believe, of increasing the Company’s equity value, thereby artificially 
      inflating the Company’s P/E multiple and distorting the value of the 
      core enterprise.
    

      The Board’s choices regarding capital allocation appear parsimonious and 
      are even more disappointing in light of the positive operational 
      progress the management team has made during and since emerging from 
      Chapter 11 reorganization. The Company is now more diversified by 
      geographical end-market and customer mix, and with its strong 
      competitive position in its core seating business and a lower fixed cost 
      base, we believe the Company is well positioned to generate 
      significantly improved margins for a given level of production.
    

      We note that the Board has de minimis ownership of the Company’s 
      shares.
    

      All of this gives us serious concerns about the current Board’s sense of 
      urgency and alignment of interests with the Company’s owners. We are 
      aware that our concerns are shared by a number of other large 
      stockholders, and are of the impression that there has been little 
      action taken, despite these concerns having been voiced directly to 
      members of the Board on multiple occasions in the past. Accordingly, we 
      believe that it is important to add new Board members who will bring 
      focus and urgency to the implementation of potential value-creating 
      initiatives, including:
    


        The immediate commencement of a $2 billion share repurchase program to 
        both take advantage of the current valuation discount, and establish a 
        more appropriate capital structure in-line with other prudently 
        capitalized industry participants; and
      

        A review of the Company’s growth capital expenditure budget and 
        acquisition and divestiture strategy, to ensure that stockholder 
        capital is being directed to those areas that offer the highest 
        possible long-term return.
      


      We reiterate that we are interested in having a constructive dialogue 
      with Mr. Wallace, Mr. Simoncini and the other directors regarding this 
      positive program for value creation.
    




            Sincerely,
