Power Integrations Names Radu Barsan Vice President of Technology






March 11, 2013 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Power Integrations (Nasdaq: POWI), 
      the leader in high-voltage integrated circuits for energy-efficient 
      power conversion, today announced that Radu M. Barsan has joined the 
      company as Vice President, Technology, in which role he will lead the 
      company’s technology development, foundry engineering and quality 
      organizations. He assumes responsibilities currently held by Derek J. 
      Bell, who will retire from Power Integrations in May after 12 years with 
      the company.
    

      Dr. Barsan has more than 30 years of experience in engineering 
      management, technology development and manufacturing in silicon and 
      compound-semiconductor technologies. Most recently, he served as 
      president and CEO of Redfern Integrated Optics, Inc., a privately held 
      optoelectronics company. Previously, he served in a succession of 
      engineering-management roles at Phaethon Communications, Cirrus Logic, 
      Advanced Micro Devices and Cypress Semiconductor. Dr. Barsan holds a 
      Ph.D. in microelectronics from Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.
    

      Commented Balu Balakrishnan, president and CEO of Power Integrations: 
      “We are delighted that Radu Barsan is joining our senior management 
      team. Radu has an outstanding track record of commercializing new 
      technologies and leading engineering organizations at companies of all 
      sizes. With both a keen technical mind and a deep understanding of all 
      aspects of a technology business, he will be a tremendous addition to 
      our company.”
    

      Mr. Balakrishnan continued: “On behalf of everyone at Power 
      Integrations, I congratulate Derek Bell on his impending retirement. 
      Derek has played a vital role in the growth and development of our 
      company over the past 12 years, and we would not be where we are today 
      without his leadership. We wish him all the best in his retirement as he 
      concludes a distinguished four-decade career in the technology industry.”
