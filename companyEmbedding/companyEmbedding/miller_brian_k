However, they cannot treat everything, and might refer patients to a specialist for certain conditions like cancer.What is family medicine?Family medicine is a practice that focuses on providing comprehensive health care services to families rather than specializing in one area or focusing on specific populations such as women or children.

I felt like I would never be truly well again; that the best I would ever be able to do is control symptoms and cope the best I could. The doctors I had seen (and I’d seen my share of them) could never really offer me answers. All they could do is order a test or prescribe something. And whatever they prescribed just masked the symptoms – it never got to what was the real problem. I knew I was on the wrong path but didn’t know how to explain it and didn’t know how to find another path. Until I found Dr Kellman.Dr Kellman is an entirely different kind of physician. It’s not just that he is a good listener and truly cares – though he is, and he does. It’s that he sees the underlying patterns to disease in ways other doctors seem to miss. His insights run deeper and his medical/scientific knowledge is broader than any doctor I have ever encountered. Simply put, Dr Kellman is in a class of his own. Not only is he more capable and knowledgeable than anyone I’d ever come across, he is also philosophically unique in that he approaches the patient with a goal of wellness, not just of treating disease. Combine this mind-set with cutting edge medicine and you have someone that transforms lives.   It’s been 2 months, and the results have been dramatic. Dr Kellman has gotten to the bottom of my health issues where so many other physicians failed. I am stronger, healthier and more alive than I have been in many years. It’s hard to put into words just how unique Dr Kellman is, or how much he has changed my life. The term “Miracle-worker” seems cliché, but it’s no exaggeration. He also has a ton of really good information on his website. If you don’t want to treat the disease, but instead want to be truly well, you really should see this amazing man. have always been an optimist. I believe life can be better. Now, thanks to Dr Kellman, mine is.Philip J. Miller, MD, FACSIndi P. ratedBy the time I Found myself in Dr. Miller's office, I had wanted a nose job for over a decade.  I was miserable and depressed.  I hated my nose for so long, and it was the only thing I saw when I looked in the mirror.  For years, I fantasized about getting it done, but I was too scared I would look "fake."  I was scared I wouldn't recognize myself when I looked in the mirror, or that my friends and family would say, "what did you do to your face?" or worse--they wouldn't even recognize me at all.  Despite all these fears, I researched for weeks, looking for the "top cosmetic surgeons" and the "best facial surgeons," etc. until I narrowed it down to a handful of prestigious, renowned doctors--Dr. Philip Miller being one of them, of course.  I set up consultations with all of them, but Dr. Miller was the first and only one I went to.  Within just 30 minutes of the initial consult, I felt at ease.  Dr. Miller and his staff assured me that: 1) it didn't matter what anyone else thought.  What mattered was that I was happy with my nose, and 2) and more importantly--Dr. Miller is an artist who specializes in bringing harmony to the face and giving his patients a natural looking nose.  In that appointment, he also recommended I get a chin implant to create harmony in my facial proportions, and I am SO glad I did.  After the healing process, I felt FINALLY ALIVE, FINALLY MYSELF, AND FINALLY BEAUTIFUL. I felt like the face in the mirror was the one that had been there all along just dying to come out.  I did NOT feel fake or unnatural.  It felt like he found the nose I was meant to have and created a harmonious face I could feel proud of and grateful for.  Since my procedure, I am a NEW woman. My life and world have opened up with so many possibilities.  I have confidence and I feel feminine and powerful.  I couldn't possibly recommend Dr. Miller more.  He will change your life.Philip J. Miller, MD, FACShazel_harbin ratedDr. Miller did my Rhinoplasty and Fat Injections under the eyes a month ago.  It was a pretty nice experience, I mean I met with Dr. Miller a few times and he addressed my concerns, the staff  was pretty helpful.  I kept going back and forth as far as what I wanted to get done and they were very accommodating.  I cancelled twice and kept rescheduling and it was such a very nice experience.  I like the fact that he was and Ear Nose and Throat Specialist.  I researched where he’s initially studied and then after looking at some of the photos online it just looks very natural and I wanted a natural look and I didn't want people to be able to tell that I had it done. After reviewing his portfolio online and meeting him, I went to a couple of different doctors and this was a better experience, he seems to know what he was talking about.  He assured me that it would look more natural, it's going to just enhance the other features on my face and that's exactly what I was looking to hear.  It's only been a month, so already I can see some sort of improvement.  There's still some swelling and stuff, but it takes a year for this thing to heal.  I mean the profile of my face looks a lot better and my face just looks a lot, I don't know what the right word is, it just looks a lot softer, you know.  I don't have my nose overbearing on my face anymore.   I've been having surgeries for not elective, but required surgeries since I was a baby and a doctor with nice bedside manner and stuff is hard to find and he definitely has that.  S. Robert Rozbruch MD.Yesenia N. ratedI consider dr. Rozbruch to be my lifesaver and my mother's as well. I sincerely credit him with saving me from a wheelchair at the tender age of 27 and discovering a congenital knocked kneed deformity "Genu Valgum" that was undiagnosed for the majority of my life that I never thought that could be corrected. What's more, after a careful history he also linked the problem to a gene deformity somewhere along my lineage and was able to correctly my mothers deformity with bilateral knee replacement. His bedside manner is also unmatched by his peers. in my opinion after becoming a physician assistant despite my disability he always encouraged me to be all that I could be! In working along side several medical provides over the years! In my opinion his intelligence and attention to detail is unmatched by many in his peer group! Moreover, he deligently opted not to do a double knee reaplacement do to my age and probable damage to the artificial joint! Instead, opting to staging a gradual external fixation using the Taylor Spacial Frame! Moreover, I consider him to be my role model and the reason why I chose medicine as a field of study! God bless him today and always. I highly recommend him and have recommended him to people with similar congenital and limb length discrepancies in my line of work all have whom have been delighted with his work and bedside manner. Philip J. Miller, MD, FACSjacobj ratedI had a Rhinoplasty in May by Dr. Miller.  I researched online and read reviews from magazines and                 things like that.  This was actually my Revision Rhinoplasty.  It was done in March for the first time, the                  result initially was great and I was very happy with it but as my nose healed, it just healed in a really weird way where the bump was starting to come back a little bit.  So, about a year later, I went back to visit, he saw it and then immediately we came up with a date for him to just revise it and fix it.  I got it done because my nose was really bad.  Its just visibly horrible.  I had a huge bump.  It went a lot smoother than I thought it was going to go especially the second time around, it was definitely            better.  My down time was maybe a couple of days so people shouldnt be that reluctant to get it done.  If they think they should do it, you know, get it done.  Once the cast is off, I could see right away that the bump was completely removed.  I had a pretty big bump right on the bridge of my nose so as soon as it was taken off, you know, it was a little bit swollen but I could see that it was gone.  Im really happy with the result.  Hes very professional.  He let me know everything that was going to happen as far as healing and everything went very smooth.  Philip J. Miller, MD, FACSshaymes ratedI heard from a friend and word...I heard from a friend and word-of-mouth in the city that Dr. Miller was a highly recommended plastic surgeon, and having received a surgery performed by him, I’d do the same. When I went to meet with him at his office, his staff was great from the minute I walked in. Everyone was very nice and welcoming, and they went through some questions with me before I met with the doctor. He went over the Eyes Mini-Lift and the CO2 Laser Peel procedure with me and made sure I understood, which was great. He gave me all the information I needed to make the decision and pretty much covered all my questions. In early April, I went in to receive both procedures. Dr. Miller was amazing, and always there whenever I needed him. I spoke with him late one night and on the weekend because I was nervous and something wasn’t right. He made sure that his assistant came right in and saw me and everything was fine.  The way I healed was amazing, my scars are minimal, and I was back to my regular activities in about three weeks. I like everything about my results.Stifelman Michael DrPatricia M. ratedIn March 2015 I had a CT scan where a renal mass was inadvertently found on my left kidney.  The tumor was thought to be malignant.  My physician immediately suggested I make an appointment to see Dr. Stifelman at NYU.  I thought to see Dr. Stifelman and then make a second appointment with a doctor nearer my home.  After the consultation meeting with Dr. Stifelman my family and I quickly decided there was no need to see anyone else as he was hands down the top of the top.  Not only was he an expert in his field but a compassionate, personable and caring professional.  Dr Stifelman was able to perform a partial nephrectomy saving half of my kidney as the mass originally thought to be malignant turned out to be benign!  I was truly blessed not only for the diagnosis but for finding Dr. Stifelman....the best of the best!!! The entire staff in Dr. Stifelman's office...Enioca, Diane, Leticia and all we encountered were exceptional!  My family and I are forever grateful for this amazing doctor and his entire team!Hershman, Dawn LZina A. ratedThe Divine Dr. Dawn is Distinctly Deluxe!Warning: This review contains graphic descriptions about an oncologist who’s a combo of a dizzying & dazzling tour de force and a tender & humane human.

WooHoo!Ciechorska, Maria, MDZina A. ratedHigh-octane MD’s house call saved life…Gadzooks!'Twas his wife, he said in a vitals.com review, who was visited by Dr. Maria in a NYC storm…she was diagnosed with sepsis just in time...whew!  Natch, I picked this M.D.  A yelp! patient’s entire review: "The best doctor in NYC!"  Ooh-là-là.  I’ve seen this inimitable wizard at work at 11 apptmnts now.  The formidable Dr. Maria is a tsunami of taste.  She welcomes you by sending sunshine into your soul.  Doc’s mythical, miraculous, magical mind is rare & well done.  She ensures that you digest her diagnosis, directions & dosage for Rx’s without hurrying you.  Wisdom is her reward for a lifetime of listening.  Dr. Ciechorska~~soft as a swan, sharp, sublime & splendid~~she does your worrying for you.  You’ll leave her office glowing, glistening, gleaming & renewed.  Perhaps I’ll adopt her. Philip J. Miller, MD, FACSvictorbaumgardner ratedLast Wednesday Dr. Miller perf...Last Wednesday Dr. Miller performed an Upper Blepharoplasty and a Lower Blepharoplasty on my eyelids. He removed extra fat through a surgical cut he stitched closed. I also received a Neck Augmentation through Liposuction, where fat was removed from my neck. Even though it has only been one week since my surgery, I look like I'm wide awake and I don’t look tired or hung over or old.  In my neck, there is an extreme difference. I go to the gym and I work out and exercise but through genetics, I had a very heavy neck. Having had Liposuction and the Neck Lift, I look like I lost 50 pounds. I look and feel healthier. The results are dramatic, yet still natural-looking. I would definitely, without hesitation, come back to this office to see Dr. Miller and Dr. Steinbrech again, and I will highly recommend them to my friends and colleagues.  Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Brian K. Miller













                    
                    Brian K. Miller never intended to become a world traveler, but life has a way of changing things.  He now lives in Wooster, Ohio, while his Japanese wife and their grown children live in Tokyo, Japan.  Brian flies back and forth between the two countries regularly so there is no telling where he will be found on any given day.His globe-trotting life has taken him to Australia, Italy, France, England, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Fiji.  Rich experiences in dozens of cities, countless towns, and a dizzying array of forests and wildlands color his writing with unexpected details and surprising insights into human behavior.  Whether writing fantasy, science fiction, or modern realism, his stories are peppered with real-life experience and lessons learned the hard way.

 The Secret World Legends


The Secret World relaunched as "The Secret World Legends" a couple weeks ago. I have not played an MMO of any kind since City of Heroes Freedom was taken offline in November 2012. At the recommendation of several people in some of the game forums I frequent, I downloaded it and tried it out. After all, this version is free to play (F2P) with all the good and evil that designation implies. I started playing on about June 26th or 27th, I don't remember exactly. My character is now lev

 The Prophecy Game 2017


Back in March of 2005 I wrote a satiric post titled, "The Prophecy Game". There had been an upsurge that winter in internet sites dedicated to psychics, eschatology, and end of the world prophecies. Most of those sites are now gone and most of their predictions never came to pass. The "prophecies" I made in that post were entirely off the cuff with no research, no magic, and no serious intent. I was trying to be funny.

 Shards


Shards is now available worldwide 
My third Kindle book is now available worldwide. Shards is a small collection of poetry. I am even less prolific as a poet than I am as a fiction writer and thus my entire life's work fits into one tiny volume. Nonetheless, it is now available worldwide on the Amazon Kindle. 
American poetry in 2017 is in pitiful shape. Inner city black or hispanic poets have an almost infinite number of venues to publish their work in. Apparently, the rest of us have

 Normalization of aberrant behavior


I'm sure by now most people around the world with access to either the internet, radio, or television are aware that a terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England has claimed the lives of at least 22 people and wounded at least 59 more. Just in case you haven't, here's a link to the most recent Fox News report as of this writing: "Manchester Terror Attack Suspect Identified".

 Reading the writing on the wall


Recently I have begun feeling somewhat aimless and driftless in my writing. I am currently working on two books, a short story collection and a poetry collection, so it's not like I'm totally devoid of goals. However, I am becoming less convinced that even with proper marketing I'll be able to find an audience. Japanese trains are the problem. Once upon a time almost everyone on the trains could be seen reading books or manga. The Japanese were vociferous readers and they had the largest per

 Ship of Heroes


For five years I have been following Heroes and Villains, City of Titans, Valiance Online, and Atlas Park Revival, along with half a dozen more that have now fallen by the wayside. Obsession is a funny thing. Different people have different obsessions. Some people are obsessed with sex, some people are obsessed with vodka, some people are obsessed with robotics, some people are obsessed with classical music, and some people are obsessed with their own self. Everyone has some kind of obsession

 I also write poetry


Shards 

"Shards" is a notebook of poetry I started over a decade ago. I don't often add entries to it, even less frequently than I update this blog, but there it sits collecting virtual dust in a quiet corner of cyberspace. 
I went back Writing.com today to check my mail and look for updates. I don't often go there anymore. Most of the writing I do nowadays is intended either as background material for publishable storytelling or as a piece of publishable story

 Lost in Cyberspace


New MeWe Group: Lost in Cyberspace 
I have been online for a very long time. Longer than most of the internet's most loyal fans have even been alive. The first cyberspace hangout where I became a regular user was back in USENET days. "rec.arts.prose" back in the old days was a wild, rambunctious place where anyone with a USENET reader could post short stories, novel chapters, article drafts, or any other prose composition and receive a wide array of responses.

 Linda Sarsour and Modern American Politics


Let me open today's blog post by saying I was moderately impressed with President Donald Trump's Inauguration Day Speech. I thought he touched on many important points. The point that struck me closest to home was his promise to remove control of the federal government from career politicians and return it the American people. I applaud this idea wholeheartedly. I am not convinced he can actually pull it off, but I am looking forward to watching him try.

 The Real Global Warming Scam


Pay attention, folks. I am about to teach you the difference between science and propaganda. 
The entire climate change campaign was, and remains, a scam designed to enrich the world's elite while impoverishing you and I. Here is how it worked: 
Someone with access to capital and resources would buy two pieces of property. One to use as a site for a new factory while the other would be a hundred acres or so of timberland. They would then pay an official assessor from the Carbon

 Like it or not, Donald Trump is Our President


I have been very patient. It has been three months since the polls closed. The inauguration is in four days. But enough is enough. Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States. Maybe he will eventually go down in history as the worst president of them all. Maybe he will lead us into our first military dictatorship in over 240 years of history as a nation. Maybe this is the dawn of the most glorious golden era in the history of humankind. No one knows. No one can know. At least, not

 Meryl Streep at the 2017 Golden Globes


I woke up this morning to a Facebook feed overflowing with outrage at Meryl Streep's speech during Golden Globe Award Ceremony last night. I didn't watch the Golden Globes. In fact, the only award ceremony I have watched for years is the American Country Music Awards. I am not boycotting the dozens of other award ceremonies broadcast on live television every year, I simply have no interest in them. I enjoy the ACM Awards because I enjoy the way the vast majority of country music performers li

 A Story of Two Maps


Election Results 2016 by County 
Active Sex Slave Cantinas 
Everyone who is important enough to have an official, public opinion is arguing over the Russian hacking of DNC mail servers. This is a very real problem, and a serious one, but it seems to me the most important fact to derive from this debate is the poor personal cybersecurity practices of the people entrusted with running our government. It should surprise no one that Vladimir Putin did everything in his power to stop

 Re-imagining Veteran's Affairs


I've been thinking about Veteran's Affairs quite a bit recently. After all, it has been in the news almost daily as a tiny subset of the many problems President-elect Donald Trump has promised to pro-actively address once he takes office. The current Veteran's Administration is a vast federal bureaucracy that like all government bureaucracies no longer exists to serve veterans. The core problem with any government bureaucracy is that once the bureaucrats develop a taste for power and easy mon

 2016 Christmas Cookie Recipe


There a great deal of chaos in the world this year both politically and economically. I could easily write up a thousand words or so providing my own, unwanted opinion on world affairs. I could go into great detail about how we arrived at this mess and how we might best find our way back out of it again. However, I'm going to stick my head in the sand instead, ignore all of it, and bake some cookies.

 The world is still on the cusp of global war


Apparently only fifty-five people in the entire world read my August 15th post, "War is Coming". I touched on this theme again in October in two posts, "Putin vs Clinton, beating the drums of nuclear war" and, "The countdown to nuclear war has begun". Naturally, when Donald Trump won the election on November 8th I breathed a great sigh of relief because even though I knew that war was still possible, it was no longer certain. However, I did not take into account

 Healthy, whole wheat pancakes from scratch


There are numerous things I could discuss today. The political world is, as always, in turmoil. The U.S. Senate just passed quite possibly the stupidest censorship bill in all of human history. The U.S. House of Representatives has a bill at the committee level that would make a state-issued Concealed Carry Weapon permit applicable in every state in the nation, regardless of which state issued it.

 December 7th, 75 years after the fact


I wrote this poem on June 5, 2012, while sitting at Haneda Airport waiting for a plane. This is poetry, and by definition all poetry is fiction, so naturally some of the "facts" are presented poetically rather than historically. 75 years ago today the Japanese Imperial Navy caught the American military sitting around sipping coffee on a pleasant tropic morning and kicked our ass in a surprise attack on both the Pearl Harbor Naval Base and US Army's Schofield Barracks on the island o

I didn't even bother asking. 
If you know anyone who claims this childish meme is true then remind them that this is America. You are only a pawn if you choose to remain one. 
Get yourself in shape, get some training, and become a first responder. Almost every EMS, Fire Department, and Law Enforcement agency in the nation is constantly hiring. If you have the right training these jobs are not hard to get.

 Hillary's stance on gun control may have helped Trump win


The political lines are drawn on the gun control issue more clearly and unmistakably than at any point since 2000. A Trump victory will no doubt be seen as the political resurgence of disaffected white Americans, mostly men, who see themselves as left behind and ignored by the elites. The triumph of previously disrespected “Second Amendment rights,” as the Trump supporters interpret them, will be part of that Trump victory narrative.

 Congratulations President Trump


It's been a couple days since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 Presidential Campaign. The dust has mostly settled. Most Americans have accepted the result. President-elect Trump and his team have already started the process of gathering some 4000 political appointees they will need to insure a smooth transition of power. A few minutes ago I filled out an application at their recruiting website. I've been retired six years now, and I love being retired, but it would be a great

 The facts about Hillary Clinton's "experience" are damning enough


(This image first appeared in the Los Angeles Times) 
Online rumors are flying as we race down to the wire. There are rumors circulating about drug cartel connections and support for child trafficking rings by Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, or their staffs. These rumors are not helpful and prove nothing. Now more than ever we need to stay focused on the facts. In the case of Hillary Clinton and her much vaunted "experience", the facts are damning enough. There is no need for wild ru

 Hillary Clinton, the Second Amendment, the Future of America


My Ruger American in .308 with Boyd's Custom Stock 
According to Hillary Clinton's own webpage, the United States of America is facing a terrible epidemic of gun violence. The core problem with this analysis is that it fundamentally overlooks one simple reality: violence is violence, regardless of the weapon used. 
According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, Table 12, in 2015 there were 15,192 murders in the United States. This represents an 11.8% increase over 2014. 11,862 of those mu
