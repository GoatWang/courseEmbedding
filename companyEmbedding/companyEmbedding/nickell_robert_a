The Rams are bringing another former USC player back to the Coliseum.Cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who played for the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, signed with the Rams on Friday.

The Rams last month signed free-agent receiver Robert Woods, USC’s all-time receptions leader.Robey-Coleman, 25, left USC after his junior season in 2013 and signed with the Bills as an undrafted free agent.

He was a regular on special teams and started 15 games. Last season against the Rams, Robey-Coleman intercepted two passes.With the score 16-16 late in the third quarter, he picked off a pass by Case Keenum and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown.He also intercepted a pass to seal the victory.The addition of Robey-Coleman, who has performed well as a slot cornerback, is expected to help free the Rams to utilize Lamarcus Joyner at safety.

Robey-Coleman joins a cornerback group that also includes Trumaine Johnson, Kayvon Webster, E.J. Gaines, Mike Jordan, Blake Countess and Troy Hill.
