SAILINGSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS 
The Firm

SailingStone Capital Partners is an employee-owned investment advisory firm focused exclusively on providing investment solutions in the global natural resource space. Based in San Francisco, SailingStone manages concentrated, long-only natural resource equity portfolios for investors.

Focus

We are in business to serve our investment partners. Our singular objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the global natural resource sector. Success is defined by investment results, not assets under management. We believe this focus to be a competitive advantage.

Ownership

We are 100% employee-owned. In addition, the team has significant co-investments in our strategy and we restrict the ability of employees to invest in single stock securities.  Encouraging the team to think and act like owners helps to reinforce the management of investment and non-investment risk and aligns us with our investment partners.

SAILINGSTONE CAPITAL - ABOUT


















Overview
Principles
Philosophy




Principles
PARTNERSHIP

We view the relationship between our clients, portfolio companies and employees as a partnership. We work with management teams that we believe will be good stewards of our clients' capital and we seek to ensure that the objectives of our employees and portfolio companies are consistent with the goals of our investment partners.

ALIGNMENT

We seek to avoid conflicts of interests by aligning the interests of our investment partners with our investment team and our portfolio company management teams. We attempt to do this by identifying management teams that we believe are focused on creating economic value and managing risks. In addition, our own incentives are tied to preserving capital and generating attractive long-term returns. Our alignment is reinforced by our own investments in the strategy.

INTEGRITY

We strive to operate under the highest ethical standards. We expect the same of our portfolio companies, particularly as it relates to corporate governance and their handling of health, safety, and environmental issues. We are not willing to sacrifice the reputation of our partners or our firm for short-term gains.

INTELLECTUAL HONESTY

We let facts drive our decision-making process and embrace opportunities to hear different perspectives as a means to improve as investors and business partners. We work in teams to reduce bias and increase productive tension. We promote a culture of open debate, focused on assumptions, not outcomes or individuals. We are candid, curious and supportive.

ACCOUNTABILITY

We hold ourselves and each other accountable for our areas of responsibility. Anything more, or less, than 100% accountability reduces our effectiveness as individuals and as a team.  We are transparent about our investment results and the drivers of returns, both good and bad.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
