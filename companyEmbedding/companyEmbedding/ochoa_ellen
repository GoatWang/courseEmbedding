Personal life[edit]
Ochoa was born in Los Angeles, California, but considers La Mesa, California her hometown. Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents got divorced when she was in high school and so she lived with her mother, three brothers. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a master of science degree and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1985, respectively. She is married to Coe Fulmer Miles, with whom she has two children. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, receiving the Student Soloist Award.[5]
Research career[edit]
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. She patented an optical system to detect defects in a repeating pattern and is a co-inventor on three patents for an optical inspection system, an optical object recognition method, and a method for noise removal in images. As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised the 35 engineers scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.
NASA career[edit]

Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991. Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office includes serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, and as acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.
Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space[6][4] when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1993. The astronauts were studying the Earth's ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space. She was a mission specialist on STS-56 (1993), was payload commander on STS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-96 and STS-110 in 2002.[7][8] Ochoa was in Mission Control during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showing Columbia's disintegration.[9]
Since 2007, she has served as Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations, and is retired from spacecraft operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.[10]
Recognition[edit]
Ochoa was recognized during Hispanic Heritage Month activities in Cleveland, Ohio on September 14, 2011. [11] The Ochoa Middle School located in Pasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Cudahy, CA and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School in East Los Angeles in 2014 are named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School. Also, Pico Rivera, California has the Ellen Ochoa Prep Academy named after austronaut Ellen Ochoa. A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the Shuttle Atlantis for an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.
Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA's Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993).[1]
Ochoa and Michael Foale are announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[12]

Personal life[edit]
Ochoa was born in Los Angeles, California, but considers La Mesa, California her hometown. Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents got divorced when she was in high school and so she lived with her mother, three brothers. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a master of science degree and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1985, respectively. She is married to Coe Fulmer Miles, with whom she has two children. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, receiving the Student Soloist Award.[5]
Research career[edit]
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. She patented an optical system to detect defects in a repeating pattern and is a co-inventor on three patents for an optical inspection system, an optical object recognition method, and a method for noise removal in images. As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised the 35 engineers scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.
NASA career[edit]

Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991. Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office includes serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, and as acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.
Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space[6][4] when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1993. The astronauts were studying the Earth's ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space. She was a mission specialist on STS-56 (1993), was payload commander on STS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-96 and STS-110 in 2002.[7][8] Ochoa was in Mission Control during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showing Columbia's disintegration.[9]
Since 2007, she has served as Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations, and is retired from spacecraft operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.[10]
Recognition[edit]
Ochoa was recognized during Hispanic Heritage Month activities in Cleveland, Ohio on September 14, 2011. [11] The Ochoa Middle School located in Pasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Cudahy, CA and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School in East Los Angeles in 2014 are named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School. Also, Pico Rivera, California has the Ellen Ochoa Prep Academy named after austronaut Ellen Ochoa. A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the Shuttle Atlantis for an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.
Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA's Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993).[1]
Ochoa and Michael Foale are announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[12]

They have two children. Ochoa mother's name is Rosanne Ochoa, and her father's name is Joseph Ochoa.Ellen OchoaEllen Ochoa          by victoria IfeShe graduated from Grossmount High School, La Mesa, California in 1975; received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics from San Diego State University in 1980, and a Master of Science Degree and Doctorate in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1981  and 1985,respectively.Ochoa's educationOchoa's first flight began on April 8, 1993, on the orbiter discovery. She was a Mission Specialist on STS-56 Atmospheric  Research Flight, which was carrying the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications  and Science know as Atlas-2. She was responsible for their primary payload, the spatan 201 satatlite, and she operated the robotic arm to deploy and retierive it. This  statelite  made forty- eight hours  of independent solar observation to measure  solar output and determine how the solar wind is  produced.Ochoa's Accomplishments.Ochoa is admirable to me because she was the first hispanic woman astronaut. She made her first flight on the Space Shuttle Discovery in April 1993. Ochoa was the lone female member of five- person team which made 148 orbits of  the earth.Ochoa began as a flight software specialist in robotics development, testing, and training in 1991. Ochoa and her crew-mates  conducted research  on solar activity, and she used a Remote Manipulator System (RMS), a 50- foot robotic arm to deploy and captures the spartan satallite that retrieved data about the solar corona and solar winds.Interesting informationOchoa graduated from Grossmont High School,La Mesa, California.Ochoa's timelineOchoa's first began April 8 on the orbiter discovery.Contunining of Ochoa's timeline.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Ochoahttp://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ochoa.htmlhttp://biography.yourdictionary.com/ellen-ochoaWork citedWhy  Ochoa is admirable.1958Ellen Ochoa was born19751980She received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics fromSan Diego State University.1981She recieved a Master of science Degree and Doctorate in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.19851993Ochoa's challenges in life.When she is about to launch, she says the riskiest part of the flight is the launch becauseits the phase of the flight when things are mostly likely to go wrong.Full transcriptMore presentations by

This wonderfully rich, detailed biography of the first Hispanic woman astronaut was written to engage and inspire, as well as inform. When children read about the life of a distinguished historical figures, they begin to see that famous people are not much different: they were children, they had families, they learned, and they worked toward a goal. Discovering connections between themselves and a real astronaut is an insightful moment for young readers!  Paperback, 32 pages.

Personal life[edit]
Ochoa was born in Los Angeles, California, but considers La Mesa, California her hometown. Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents got divorced when she was in high school and so she lived with her mother, three brothers. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a master of science degree and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1985, respectively. She is married to Coe Fulmer Miles, with whom she has two children. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, receiving the Student Soloist Award.[5]
Research career[edit]
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. She patented an optical system to detect defects in a repeating pattern and is a co-inventor on three patents for an optical inspection system, an optical object recognition method, and a method for noise removal in images. As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised the 35 engineers scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.

Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991. Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office includes serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, and as acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.
Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space[6][4] when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1993. The astronauts were studying the Earth's ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space. She was a mission specialist on STS-56 (1993), was payload commander on STS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-96 and STS-110 in 2002.[7][8] Ochoa was in Mission Control during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showing Columbia's disintegration.[9]
Since 2007, she has served as Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations, and is retired from spacecraft operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.[10]
Recognition[edit]
Ochoa was recognized during Hispanic Heritage Month activities in Cleveland, Ohio on September 14, 2011. [11] The Ochoa Middle School located in Pasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Cudahy, CA and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School in East Los Angeles in 2014 are named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School. Also, Pico Rivera, California has the Ellen Ochoa Prep Academy named after austronaut Ellen Ochoa. A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the Shuttle Atlantis for an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.
Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA's Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993).[1]
Ochoa and Michael Foale are announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[12]

Personal life[edit]
Ochoa was born in Los Angeles, California, but considers La Mesa, California her hometown. Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents got divorced when she was in high school and so she lived with her mother, three brothers. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a master of science degree and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1985, respectively. She is married to Coe Fulmer Miles, with whom she has two children. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, receiving the Student Soloist Award.[5]
Research career[edit]
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration.

Personal life[edit]
Ochoa was born in Los Angeles, California, but considers La Mesa, California her hometown. Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents got divorced when she was in high school and so she lived with her mother, three brothers. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a master of science degree and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1985, respectively. She is married to Coe Fulmer Miles, with whom she has two children. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, receiving the Student Soloist Award.[5]
Research career[edit]
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. She patented an optical system to detect defects in a repeating pattern and is a co-inventor on three patents for an optical inspection system, an optical object recognition method, and a method for noise removal in images. As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised the 35 engineers scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.
NASA career[edit]

Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991. Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office includes serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, and as acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.
Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space[6][4] when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1993. The astronauts were studying the Earth's ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space. She was a mission specialist on STS-56 (1993), was payload commander on STS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-96 and STS-110 in 2002.[7][8] Ochoa was in Mission Control during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showing Columbia's disintegration.[9]
Since 2007, she has served as Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations, and is retired from spacecraft operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.[10]
Recognition[edit]
Ochoa was recognized during Hispanic Heritage Month activities in Cleveland, Ohio on September 14, 2011. [11] The Ochoa Middle School located in Pasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Cudahy, CA and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School in East Los Angeles in 2014 are named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School. Also, Pico Rivera, California has the Ellen Ochoa Prep Academy named after austronaut Ellen Ochoa. A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the Shuttle Atlantis for an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.
Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA's Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993).[1]
Ochoa and Michael Foale are announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
