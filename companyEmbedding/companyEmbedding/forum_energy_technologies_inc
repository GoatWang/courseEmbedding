Forum Energy Technologies Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results | Business Wire


























































Forum Energy Technologies Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results






July 27, 2017 08:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FET) today announced second 
      quarter 2017 revenue of $201 million, an increase of $30 million, or 
      18%, from the first quarter 2017. Net loss for the quarter was $78 
      million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $16 
      million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017. 
      Excluding $69 million or $0.71 per share of special items, the adjusted 
      net loss was $0.10 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017 
      compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.14 per diluted share in the first 
      quarter 2017.
    


      Special items in the second quarter of 2017 included pre-tax charges of 
      $68 million for goodwill impairment, $3 million for restructuring 
      charges, and $3 million of foreign exchange losses. See Tables 1-5 for a 
      reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.
    

      During the quarter, we reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill in 
      our Subsea product line, which represents less than 10% of our revenues. 
      The review was triggered by the softening of oil prices and the 
      developing consensus that production from low cost oil basins would be 
      sufficient to meet anticipated demand for a longer period. This is 
      expected to delay the need for production from higher cost basins and 
      delay the recovery in offshore activity. As a result, we determined that 
      the carrying value of the goodwill in our Subsea product line was 
      impaired.
    

Segment Results


      Completions segment revenue was $55 million, a 29% increase 
      sequentially, primarily due to customer spending on pressure pumping 
      equipment. New inbound orders in the second quarter were $67 million, a 
      31% increase from the first quarter 2017, resulting in a book to bill 
      ratio of 123%. The Completions segment designs and manufactures products 
      for the well construction, completion, stimulation and intervention 
      markets primarily in North America.
    

      Production & Infrastructure segment revenue was $83 million, a 23% 
      increase from the first quarter 2017, due to improved revenue from both 
      well site production equipment and valve products. New inbound orders in 
      the second quarter were $93 million, a 24% increase from the first 
      quarter 2017, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 112%. During the 
      quarter, orders for valves reached a record level on strong demand in 
      North America. The Production & Infrastructure segment manufactures U.S. 
      land well site production equipment, desalination refinery equipment, 
      and a wide range of valves for energy, industrial and mining customers.
    

      Drilling and Subsea segment revenue was $64 million, a 4% increase from 
      the first quarter 2017. Subsea equipment revenue was flat with the 
      previous quarter. New inbound orders for the Drilling & Subsea segment 
      in the second quarter were $54 million, resulting in a book to bill 
      ratio of 84%. Drilling & Subsea operations focus primarily on 
      manufactured equipment and consumable products for global drilling and 
      subsea contractors.
    

Review and Outlook


      Prady Iyyanki, Forum’s President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, 
      "We are pleased with our strong growth in orders and revenue, especially 
      within our Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments, as both 
      are highly levered to North America activity. We generated 18% growth in 
      revenue and returned to positive adjusted EBITDA for the company, with 
      improvement in each of our three segments.
    

      "Forum is benefiting from the recovery in the U.S. land drilling and 
      completions activity. Our U.S. revenue in the second quarter increased 
      23% sequentially and represented 78% of total company revenue. We expect 
      continued strong demand for our Completions and Production & 
      Infrastructure products because of their exposure to North American 
      completions activity, even if the rig count flattens or declines.
    

      "Our financial liquidity remains strong. We ended the quarter with $221 
      million of cash on hand and nothing drawn on our bank credit facility. 
      During the quarter, working capital expanded as we ramped up our 
      manufacturing volumes to respond to customer demand.
    

      "We are pleased with the acquisition of Multilift, which we closed in 
      July. Multilift’s innovative products extend the useful life of an 
      electrical submersible pump by protecting it against sand and other 
      solids. The acquisition fits with our strategy of expanding our product 
      offering in Completions.
    

      "Forum expects diluted loss per share for the third quarter 2017 of 
      $0.07 to $0.04 and sequential revenue growth of 8% to 12%."
    

Recent Events


      Forum acquired Multilift for approximately $40 million. Based in 
      Houston, Texas, Multilift manufactures the patented SandGuardTM 
      and the CycloneTM completion tools.
    

      Forum has received orders thus far in 2017 for over 480,000 horsepower 
      of J-Mac hydraulic fracturing power ends and for eight of its new 
      innovative manifold trailers, the "ICBM."

(1) Includes earnings from equity investment.
        



(2) Includes transaction expenses, gain/(loss) on sale of 
          assets, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
        



(3) The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA 
          is useful to the Company's investors because EBITDA is an 
          appropriate measure of evaluating the company's operating 
          performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for 
          strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the 
          business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the 
          Company's securities and making strategic acquisitions. In addition, 
          EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community. See 
          the attached separate schedule for the reconciliation of GAAP to 
          non-GAAP financial information.
        



(4) Includes transaction expenses.
        



(5) Refer to Table 1 for schedule of adjusting items.
        



(6) In order to better align with the predominant 
          customer base of the segment, we have moved management and financial 
          reporting of our fully rotational torque machine operations, which 
          operates under the AMC brand, from the Drilling and Subsea segment 
          to the Completions segment. Prior period financial information has 
          been revised to conform with current period presentation with no 
          impact to total segment operating results.

(1) Includes earnings from equity investment.
        



(2) Includes transaction expenses, loss on sale of 
          business, gain/(loss) on sale of assets, and impairment of goodwill 
          and intangible assets.
        



(3) The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA 
          is useful to the Company's investors because EBITDA is an 
          appropriate measure of evaluating the company's operating 
          performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for 
          strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the 
          business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the 
          Company's securities and making strategic acquisitions. In addition, 
          EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community. See 
          the attached separate schedule for the reconciliation of GAAP to 
          non-GAAP financial information.
        



(4) Includes transaction expenses and loss on sale of 
          business.
        



(5) Refer to Table 2 for schedule of adjusting items.
        



(6) In order to better align with the predominant 
          customer base of the segment, we have moved management and financial 
          reporting of our fully rotational torque machine operations, which 
          operates under the AMC brand, from the Drilling and Subsea segment 
          to the Completions segment. Prior period financial information has 
          been revised to conform with current period presentation with no 
          impact to total segment operating results.

(1) The book-to-bill ratio is calculated by dividing the 
          dollar value of orders received in a given period by the revenue 
          earned in that same period. We believe that this ratio is useful to 
          the Company’s investors because it provides an indication of whether 
          the demand for our products, in the markets in which we operate, is 
          strengthening or declining. A ratio of greater than one is 
          indicative of improving market demand, while a ratio of less than 
          one would suggest weakening demand. In addition, we believe the 
          book-to-bill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future 
          revenues for our business than other measures, such as order 
          backlog, because the majority of our products are activity based 
          consumable items or shorter cycle capital equipment, neither of 
          which are typically ordered by customers far in advance.
        



(2) In order to better align with the predominant 
          customer base of the segment, we have moved management and financial 
          reporting of our fully rotational torque machine operations, which 
          operates under the AMC brand, from the Drilling and Subsea segment 
          to the Completions segment. Prior period financial information has 
          been revised to conform with current period presentation with no 
          impact to total segment operating results.

          (1) The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted 
          EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted Diluted EPS is useful 
          to the Company's investors because (i) EBITDA is an appropriate 
          measure of evaluating the Company's operating performance and 
          liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic 
          opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, 
          strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Company's 
          securities and making strategic acquisitions and (ii) each of 
          adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted Diluted EPS 
          is useful to investors to assess and understand operating 
          performance, especially when comparing those results with previous 
          and subsequent periods or forecasting performance for future 
          periods, primarily because management views the excluded items to be 
          outside of the Company's normal operating results. In addition, 
          EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community. See 
          the attached separate schedule for the reconciliation of GAAP to 
          non-GAAP financial information.
        



          (2) Foreign exchange, net primarily relates to cash and receivables 
          denominated in U.S. dollars by some of our non-U.S. subsidiaries 
          that report in a local currency, and therefore the loss has no 
          economic impact in dollar terms.

 FORUM ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (NYSE:FET) Files An 8-K Results of Operations and Financial ConditionItem 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 27, 2017, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. A copy of the release is furnished herewith as Exhibit99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (“EBITDA”) and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share (“Adjusted Diluted EPS”) and free cash flow, before acquisitions (“free cash flow”). A reconciliation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”) is included as an attachment to the press release. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and free cash flow is useful to the Company's investors because (i) EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the Company's operating performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Company's securities and making strategic acquisitions and (ii) each of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and free cash flow is useful to investors to assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing those results with previous and subsequent periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management views the excluded items to be outside of the Company's normal operating results. In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community.
The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 
Item 2.02 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K:

We are a global oilfield products company, serving the drilling, subsea, completion, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. Our products include highly engineered capital equipment as well as products that are consumed in the drilling, well construction, production and transportation of oil and natural gas.Forum is headquartered in Houston, Texas with manufacturing and distribution facilities strategically located around the globe.
Our legacy brands represent some of the best known in the business. The most recognizable include Perry™ and Sub-Atlantic™ (ROVs); B + V Oil Tools, P-Quip, Pipe Wranglers and Vanoil (tubular handling); Dynacon (LARS and winches); and Davis-Lynch, Cannon and Merrimac (downhole products).
 
 





 
Forum is proud to bring together a multitude of well-known, trusted brands in our industry.  Diverse in their product lines, geography and the sector of the energy industry they serve but united by one common element.
