For most print service providers, their biggest challenge is identifying and capturing new clients--especially in this highly competitive marketplace. One often overlooked strategy is looking to vertical markets for new revenue opportunities. To better assess your capabilities to serve vertical markets, you need to first understand their behaviors and service needs.This presentation on the Casino and Gaming Market is part of a series of Presentationscreated to help you better understand, and target, manyof the highest value verticals according to InfoTrends.Let’s get started. Do you have any casino and gaming clients in your portfolio? If not, you may be missing out. 48 states have some form of legal gaming, and according to the 2010 US Census, the commercial casino sector comprises nearly 500 casino firms, employing more than 300,000 employees. This is a vastly growing industry, with 2012 marking three consecutive years of increased revenue growth, as well as the second-highest revenue year in casino history. 15 of the 22 states that had commercial casinos operating in 2011 experienced gross gaming revenue increases in 2012. The largest increases (Kansas, +603.7%; Maryland, +142.6%; Maine, +66.9%; and New York, +43.1%) can be attributed to the opening of new casinos. The perception of casino gambling is also becoming more acceptable in the eyes of the American public, as a 2013 public opinion polling found that 85% believe gambling to be acceptable for themselves or others. Overall acceptability was over 80% for all age groups.Brought to you by Mohawk MakeReady, this presentation can be used for your internal training purposes.
The commercial casino and gaming market comprises establishments that house gambling facilities, that typically include banked games, table wagering games, slot machines and sports betting. Some establishments, such as hotels, provide lodging and other amenities:Industry Segments (NAICS 713200)Gambling Industry (Casinos, except Casino Hotels)Industry Segments (NAICS 721120)Casino HotelsMakeReady Tip: Take a look in your local area and see if there is a casino and gaming establishment to approach with your services. 
Understanding the current and upcoming trends for a particular market can help give you insight on activities that may influence their decision to bring on a new vendor. According to 2013 Survey of Casino Entertainment, 48 states have some form of legalized gambling and gaming, with 22 states having commercial casinos in place. Opportunities to bring solutions to the table are available.A study by InfoTrends reports that while stand-alone, printed direct mail is on the decline, integrated cross-media campaigns are more important than ever before. However, print still plays a key role as campaigns helps drive mobile and social traffic. Studies by Global Gaming Expo show that 95% of casino marketers believe marketing programs will change and develop in the coming 10-15 years, especially in regards to better understanding player behavior and tendencies and using that data in digital marketing communications. MakeReady Tip: Take time to understand where that market is going. It will help you be perceived as intelligent and cognizant of shifts in the market, ultimately providing you with new opportunities to better serve your clients. 
National public survey was conducted on Americans who had visited a casino within the past year (notable results displayed in slide above).MakeReady Tip: Take time to understand your target market. It will help you be perceived as intelligent and cognizant of shifts in the market, ultimately providing you with new opportunities to better serve your clients. 
Like any other organizations, the casino and gaming segment faces many challenges that ultimately provide opportunities for print service providers. One of these challenges include reaching and connecting with prospective and current visitors in a world with more channels than ever before. Multi-channel marketing methods represent an opportunity for print and marketing service providers to help the gaming industry extend its communication strategy across multiple channels. Service providers can assist the gaming industry by offering a variety of services, ranging from creation and execution of cross-channel campaigns, to promotion and results tracking. Analyzing and leveraging customer data to create marketing loyalty programs is also a key growth area. InfoTrends found that 67% of surveyed casinos capture and store this data, making it readily available. Additionally, driving non-gambling revenue is also a key area of consideration.
Studies by Global Gaming Expo show that 77% of casino marketers feel advancements in the past 10-15 years have dramatically altered the way they interact with customers, and 95% believe marketing programs will change and develop in the coming 10-15 years, especially in regards to better understanding player behavior and tendencies and using that data in digital marketing communications. MakeReady Tip: Sell the value of personalization while focusing on promotional and data-acquisition applications.
Casino and gaming establishments have a wide variety of marketing communications needs. All of these needs provide a tangible opportunity for your company’s services. Here is a list of some of the most common uses as determined by a recent InfoTrends study.Top 5 Marketing Channel ImportanceWebsite (84%)Kiosks displaying players’ club services (80%)Direct mail (69%)New media advertising (via mobile) (57%)Traditional advertisements (53%)
When developing cross-channel marketing campaigns, it’s important to think outside the slots…or box!In this industry, data is readily available. Player history is typically tracked through player club cards, making it possible for campaigns to be created to specifically segment and target individuals. These personalized communications can be extremely valuable in driving revenue for casinos.It’s also important to look at the other activities casino visitors participate in. Not everyone gambles! In fact, over a quarter of casino visitors never or rarely ever gamble. However, many visit nearby attractions, dine in restaurants, and see live entertainment. Even if your recipient isn’t spending money on the slots, there are plenty of opportunities to entice them to spend elsewhere. 
How can your printing business capture some of this business? You need to bring something more than just your capabilities. You need to bring value. One way to differentiate your company is to provide unique materials that enable higher value printed products to be created. Let’s take a look at how Mohawk Specialty Digital Substrates can help you provide this value to your education customers.We discussed printed direct mail and signage as a type of print collateral being produced by some gaming organizations. Here are some specific examples of how new Mohawk Specialty Digital Substrates can be used for this type of application and environment.Synthetic Materials	- Choose any of the moisture, wear resistant RigidViynlor Alcohol Resistant Premium Polyester sheets for durable menus at casino restaurants.Pressure Sensitive Materials	- Use Pressure Sensitive materials to create attention-grabbing campaign mailers and luggage tags enticing recipients to envision their next trip to your gaming facility.Magnetic Materials	- Score big points with magnetic materials! Create promotional magnets encouraging recipients to display free gaming plays or the latest deals on their refrigerator at home. Embedded Card Materials	-  Use these materials for player club card campaigns, discount cards or membership incentives.Mohawk Synthetic Materials are designed for the entire range of digital color production presses including those using high heat to fuse toner as well as HP Indigo ElectroInk.For more information, visit www.mohawkconnects.com
Now that we’ve discussed tangible applications to sell into this market, let’s take a look at two specific customer case studies.Wynn Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada was looking to engage a guest’s sense of touch by elevating in-room menus to a premium textured paper. They understand the association between touch and materials and the message premium materials conveys to guests.Prairie Band Casino &amp; Resort in Mayetta, Kansas was looking to target customers that had not visited the casino in the past three months. 
The gaming/hospitality vertical often engages in a form of marketing called sensory branding. This is where senses are engaged, including the sense of touch referred to in the scientific community as “haptics”. Guests find the lobby with music &amp; scents in the air. Rooms with linens and products. Think of all the materials that direct and support a guest’s experience while dining, in-room or using services like the spa.The Wynn Resorts is a long time Mohawk customer who understands this association to touch and the materials they use to support this experience. Legendary Mohawk Superfine is key element in their brand standard guidelines. But don’t take our word for it (read quote from Doris Young).The Wynn utilizes many online and offline marketing channels – but it is print that they use to drive action across all platforms. The Wynn knows that better materials equal better results due to the constant testing that is done with all marketing materials (Smooth vs. eggshell finish, etc. Rounded corners, etc.). A dramatic menu redesign for their in-room dining had to elicit touch and convey the luxurious dining experience the guest was about to experience. It is all about integration and effectiveness.
To target their audience and drive revenue among past visitors who hadn’t been to the casino in at least 3 months, Prairie Band Casino &amp; Resort worked with a print service provider to create a direct mail piece. Included was a promotion for a free night’s stay and a free play offer at the casino. Also incorporated into the mailer was a luggage tag, allowing the recipient to move one step closer to envisioning their retreat. As a result, the campaign generated a 19% response rate with an 80% increase in incremental guests, which resulted in a ROI of 670%.
The casino and gaming market provides numerous revenue opportunities for you to capture. It really boils down to your ability to develop data-driven marketing solutions that help casinos market gaming and non-gaming services. This can take the form of: Database management Data-driven personalization Campaign management Cross-Media services High-quality digital print Printed Direct Mail helps drive traffic to mobile and social platforms, but it is critical for solutions to be highly interactive and creative. Helping bridge the gap between print and digital is a trend gaming facilities will continue to look to, especially as spending for mobile and social is on the rise.

“Choosing the right paper accentuates your messages to the guest. It
says you care.
Having something tangible in your hand that feels good, from the gift
card, letter, invitation or marketing offer we send, holding it and
touching it has a more lasting impression.
Print is not deleted from their mind as easily as a „click‟.”

                              I usually play when the kids have gone to bed or at school, but I always had to sit at the computer. Now I play on my mobile 99% of the time. It was my first time playing slots on my mobile so I had a few questions but the customer service lady got back to me very quickly.

                  Casino and hospitality marketing
              


      1.
    Casino MarketingExcerpts from Chapter Three 
  


        2.
      
    Predictive Analytics for the Gaming Industry“However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionallylook at the results.”                                     ~Winston Churchill 
  


        3.
      
    Casino MarketingOften referred to as the heartbeat of a casinos operations,marketing affects almost every single function at a modern casinoproperty yet it is often taken for granted. Casino marketinginvolves not only providing the right offer to the right patron at theright time, but also includes retaining existing patrons, as well asacquiring new ones. To perform these marketing tasks, the casinomarketer needs to not only fully understand the patrons in itsdatabase but also figure out how to get new patrons onto itsproperty and into its databases as well. 
  


        4.
      
    To both allocate resources properly and attract and retain the mostprofitable customer segments, the casino marketing department needs tounderstand which segments “pay the bills.” Some of the questions theymust ask are:-- Who are the casinos current customers?-- Which customer segments contribute the most or the least to theproperty’s revenue?-- Does it make more sense to design promotions that attract playersegments with low theoretical win levels but high frequency of visitation, orshould the casino allocate promotional dollars to player segments withhigher theoretical win rates but less frequent visitations?-- Where do the casino’s customers live?-- What is the overall contribution of each zip code, country or province? 
  


        5.
      
    Market SegmentationIn their article How a professional casino consultant canhelp ‘optimize’ your casino’s marketing, Steve Karoul andDean Macomber advise casino marketers to think of theirpotential market as a series of interconnecting circles ofdiffering categories within which there is an endlessvariety of options. They state that the segments caninclude, but are not limited to, the following:•   Geographic•   Demographic•   Psychological•   Cultural•   Age•   Activities 
  


        6.
      
    When broken down this way, one person would obviouslybe included in many different categories and eachsegment could be broken down into smaller segments.For geography, there would be three segments; Nearby or“convenience” gaming customers, to whom distancematters a lot; Middle distances or “excursion” gamingcustomers, to whom distance is somewhat of an issue;and Large distances or the “destination” gamingcustomers, to whom distance matters little (Karoul andMacomber). 
  


        7.
      
    When creating their marketing strategies, casinooperators must think in terms of the Market Cycle ofDemand Creation, which contains the following threephases:• Awareness,• Trial offer, and• Repeated visitation. 
  


        8.
      
    For starters, consumers must know that the product – thecasino – exists. Once patrons arrive, they must be turnedinto loyal customers who will repeatedly return soattempts must be made to have then enroll into a playerclub. Once enrolled, the casino marketers can track thepatrons spend very accurately. Armed with this importantinformation, a casino marketer can determine the patronslikes and dislikes and then target market to themspecifically. At this point, casino marketers should developa range of programs and offers that will generaterepeated visitations (Karoul and Macomber). 
  


        9.
      
    Marketing campaigns are where the rubber meetsthe road. Whether the campaigns are monthly directmails campaigns, birthday or other promotions, amarketing automation tool can provide a user-friendly mechanism for assigning the data-specificrequirements to identify customer segments. 
  


        10.
      
    Once the marketing campaign criteria are established, allfuture campaigns can be assured of having the samecriteria. Scheduling campaigns will allow the marketingteam to set-up recurring campaigns weeks in advanceversus setting up individual campaigns one at a time. Thegoal is to automate routine processes into regularlyscheduled jobs. The main advantage of an automationtool is that every campaign, communication and responsecan be attributed to a specific event. 
  


        11.
      
    Customer-focused marketing campaignsBy taking advantage of the more powerful, statistically basedsegmentation methods, customers can be segmented not only bydollar value, but also on all known information, which can includebehavioral information gleaned from a customer’s resort activities,as well as his or her simple patron demographic information. Thismore detailed segmentation allows for more targeted andcustomer-focused marketing campaigns. 
  


        12.
      
    Predictive Analytics can help to:– Identify the casinos most valuable patrons.– Predict a patrons future worth and/or his or her future behavior.– Plan the timing and placement of advertising campaigns.– Create personalized advertisements.– Define which market segments are growing most rapidly.– Segment patrons into groups based on their behaviors and thencreate marketing campaigns to exploit those behaviors. 
  


        13.

    Predictive AnalyticsIn their article “Knowing What to Sell, When, and to Whom,”authors V. Kumar, R. Venkatesan, and W. Reinartz (2006)showed how, by simply understanding and tweaking behavioralpatterns, they could increase the hit rate for offers andpromotions to consumers, which then had an immediate – andsubstantial – impact on revenues.By applying statistical models based on the work of Nobel prize-winning economist Daniel McFadden, researchers accuratelypredicted not only a specific person’s purchasing habits, but alsothe specific time of the purchase to an accuracy of 80%(Venkatesan and Reinartz, 2006).

    Manipulating Customer BehaviorSuccessful marketing is about reaching a consumer with aninteresting offer when he or she is primed to accept it.Knowing what might interest a patron is half the battle to makinga sale and this is where customer intelligence and predictiveanalytics comes in.Customer analytics has evolved from simply reporting customerbehavior to segmenting customers based on their profitability topredicting that profitability, to improving those predictions, toactually manipulating customer behavior with target-specificpromotional offers and marketing campaigns.

    Campaign Effectiveness: Capturing Response Data To truly understand the success or failure of a marketing campaign, casino and hotel operators must have an effective response tracking system. Costs and revenues can be combined with promotional contact and response information, which will provide a complete picture of response rates and ROI. Because this information is stored at the individual customer level, various levels of modeling, segmentation and analysis can be performed for strategic targeting of a campaign.

    Predictive Analytics – Regression Analysis:Regression analysis is the process of predicting the continuousdependent variable from a number of independent variables. Itattempts to find a function which models the data with the leasterror. Regression analysis can be used on data which is eithercontinuous or dichotomous, but cannot be used to determine acausal relationship. Regression analysis focuses on establishinga mathematical equation as a model to represent the interactionsbetween the different variables under consideration. Regressionmodels are particularly effective to find patron worth because themodel can be used to score historical data to predict an unknownoutcome.
