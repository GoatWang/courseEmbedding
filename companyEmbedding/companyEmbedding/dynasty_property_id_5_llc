The Dynasty was founded in 2007 on the blood sweat and tears of two men 
who loved professional wrestling, but hated what the current Independent 
scene was offering. 
In 2007, two friends (Tom “Ugly” Burnell & Chris Envy were professional 
wrestlers traveling the roads together, working where ever they could to get 
their names out there. They worked some well run promotions, as well as 
some really, really bad ones. Both as life long wrestling fans, felt the fans 
deserved more than the current product.
Together, they decided they wanted to see if they could do better. They 
decided to rent a ring from a promoter they had both worked for in NJ, and 
found a venue willing to donate the property in exchange for a donation. 
Envy contacted wrestlers he was familiar with locally and Tom took care of 
the local promotional side of things as well as sponsorships. On August 11, 
2007, they founded The Xyreme Wrestling Alliance (XWA). 
“An Alliance of the most extreme wrestlers int he area...” Envy deemed the 
promotion in the opening monologue (Promo)  (Highlights). The event was 
a rousing success as over 300-local fans filled the parking lot of the D.M. 
Hamilton Steamer company in Coxsackie, NY. All total, over $1500 was 
donated on behalf of the XWA and the two were off and running 
(RegisterStar post). Or so they thought.
They began planning a follow-up event in October of 2007, until Envy 
received a notfication from the New York State Athletic Commission 
stating that running a pro-wrestling event in NY without a promoter’s 
license was a Misdemeanor. Alas, the XWA once promising future met an 
early demise to the dismay of many of the local wrestlers who desperately 
sought a home to wrestle away from another local promotion.
That is until May 2013. Envy and Ugly had once again got bitten by the 
promotional bug and decided to try their hand at running shows again. 
This time, in a more legitimate way. They partnered with another promoter 
and co-promoted the event under their license and again rented a ring to 
showcase better talent, better production value, better awareness of the 
business side of things. On August 24, 2013 Tom and Chris debuted The 
Dynasty before 200 fans in Cobleskill, NY with an event dubbed 
“Diamonds are Forever”. 
The event featured former WWE Champoion and future TNA Champoion 
Bobby Lashley ad WWE Hall of Famer, “Mr. USA” Tony Atlas. Also on the 
card were Ring of Honor TV Champion Matt Taven, Kasey Ray, Veda Scott, 
Kekoa, M.P.G. Fenris Fortune and Furio Falcone among others. Local talents 
Pure Dynamite (Bad Brad Wesley and Chuck Deep) and “Too Rad” Kyle 
Brad made their return (match) as they were also on the original 2007 event.
Too be continued...
