About Us - Quotient





































About Us

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Who we are
Quotient is a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets. With an initial focus on blood grouping and serological disease screening, Quotient is developing its proprietary MosaiQ™ technology platform to offer a breadth of tests that is unmatched by existing commercially available transfusion diagnostic instrument platforms. The company's operations are based in Edinburgh, Scotland; Eysins, Switzerland; and Newtown, Pennsylvania.
How it all began
Quotient's research & manufacturing subsidiary formerly traded under the name Alba Bioscience. Alba was originally established in Scotland in the 1940s to manufacture blood typing reagents as part of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service. In addition to supplying its products throughout the Scottish National Health System, the company grew and expanded its offerings as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) supplier to the world’s leading transfusion diagnostics companies. In 2007, it was privatized and became part of what is now Quotient.
Our Values:
Customer Focused
The customer is the focus of our daily work—being responsive to their needs and delivering what we promise, when we promise.
Making a difference
As individuals, we will make a positive contribution to our organization and our customers.
Responsible
We will support and encourage our employees to be accountable, productive, and collaborative.
Investing in our people
We will empower our employees to fulfill their potential through collaboration, quality training, and personal development.
Innovative
We will collectively lead the industry in innovation and advance new developments in our field.
Committed to quality
We will focus on quality in an environment of continuous improvement.

	We are an established, commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the development and commercialization of innovative tests for blood grouping and serological disease screening, commonly referred to as transfusion diagnostics. Blood grouping involves specific procedures performed at donor or patient testing laboratories to characterize blood, which includes antigen typing and antibody identification. We have over 30 years experience manufacturing and supplying conventional reagent products used for blood grouping within the $2.8 billion global transfusion diagnostics market. We are developing MosaiQTM, our proprietary technology platform, to better address the comprehensive needs of this large and established market. We believe MosaiQTM has the potential to be a transformative technology, significantly reducing the cost of blood grouping in the donor and patient testing environments, while improving patient outcomes.
