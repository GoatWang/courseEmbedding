Maine Woods Biomass Exports proposes Prospect wood chip project
By Katie Fletcher | January 13, 2015

A phytosanitation heat-treatment operation for processing wood chips is proposed for construction in Prospect, Maine, by Searsport-based developer Maine Woods Biomass Exports LLC. The anticipated $20 million project has a time frame of around March 31 to commence with preliminary drawings, architectural design and engineering, and to begin with preliminary permitting, entitlement and zoning work. Project construction is predicted to begin around August of this year, and once completed would provide wood chips to European markets by exporting from the Port of Searsport. Searsport was selected for its rail line, fiber supply and ship loading system.
News about the proposed project is already trickling out because MWBE President Arthur House hopes to employ workers as early as this month from Maine’s forest products industry to start logging and debarking for shipment to a potential buyer, a Turkish manufacturing company.
The reason House is looking to employ workers early is in response to a nearby Verso Paper Corp. paper mill closing its doors. House has the potential to employ laid-off workers now, prior to the wood chip facility’s construction. “I was trying to address the fact that 570 people are laid off right now at Verso, and that I could right now, today, start buying logs, and I could start debarking, chipping and processing logs for future work and future sales to a country that doesn’t require heat-treating just yet,” House said. “I’m just trying to put some people back to work.”
An invitational meeting was held Jan. 6 for the involved project entities. The meeting introduced the project’s interested loggers to the buyers. MWBE’s potential customers also had the opportunity on their visit to meet rail line personnel, port authorities, state authorities, town officials and others important to the success of the project. House hopes, that if supported, the opportunity to employ workers early can move forward, and buyers can redirect their vessel to Searsport earlier than planned.
The proposed wood chip facility, once completed, could potentially use a portion of the fiber originally sourced for the paper mill. Initial construction plans for the facility include one production line of approximately 300,000 metric tons annually of heat-treated wood chips. This material would be sourced within a 50 to 60 mile radius of the central location in Prospect, and then within a similar radius to sidings along the project’s railroad. “Now people who are not within 50 to 60 miles of Prospect, will probably be within 20 to 30 miles of any single siding we would give them to be able to operate at,” House said. “That opens it up to the whole state to be able to provide fiber.”
Phase one of the project is the refurbishment of an existing rail siding and the new construction of a rail siding along the Central Maine and Quebec Railway property boundary, formerly the Lane Sand and Gravel Pit. This rail portion of the project is estimated to cost about $2 million. “We’ll be picking up a lot of the unused fiber from the underutilized logging industry along the rail, who without this rail in their backyard may not have been able to participate in the whole operation,” House said.
Phase two is constructing the wood chip facility. Construction is tentatively slated for August of 2015 with a six to ten month building period. This phase is budgeted for $18 million and could employ 40 to 50 full-time workers on a three-shift basis. The facility uses phytosanitation or fumigation to treat the fiber to European standards. The phytosanitation system design would be done by Thompson Dehydrating Company Inc. “We’re using the only internationally-recognized heat treatment and sanitation or pasteurization process,” House said. “It’s approved by all ship owners and handlers, it’s approved by all of the EU countries, and we’re addressing a need in the EU.”
The third phase of the project contemplates overall project expansion. “My process works,” House said. “I’ve worked on it for three and a half years. I’ve already achieved a USDA approval on my heat-treatment process, and I’ve already shipped heat-treated material to Germany successfully.”
House adds, “We consider Prospect to be the emerging fiber hub to the EU with Searsport becoming the preeminent Port of Origination to Europe.”

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/19/2017
            

                BBB has determined that Maine Biomass Exports, LLC. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
