History[edit]




The Shansby Group logo in use prior to 2005


The firm was founded in 1987 as the Montgomery Consumer Fund, a partnership with an initial equity interest from Montgomery Securities. In 1988 the firm's founders, J. Gary Shansby and Charles H. Esserman, repurchased Montgomery Securities' interest and renamed the company The Shansby Group. [10] The firm changed its name to TSG Consumer Partners in 2005 when Esserman became CEO. Shansby left the firm in 2005 to focus on philanthropic projects as well as health issues.[8]
The firm has been noted as an anomaly in the private equity industry for its high percentage of female employees – 50 percent of the firm’s employees are women, compared to 13.7% of private equity professionals in North America.[11] In its most recent fund, TSG reported a net return of 50 percent, more than double the industry average. [12]
Funds[edit]
TSG closed its sixth fund, TSG6, in November 2011 with $1.3 billion. The seventh fund in the sequence, TSG7A and TSG7B, closed in November 2015 with $2.5 billion.[13][14] The firm has approximately $5 billion in equity capital under management as of December 2015.[7]

About
CESSERMAN@TSGCONSUMER.COM 415.217.2340






Chuck has over 25 years of private equity investment experience and, together with the partners of TSG, built the first and most experienced consumer focused equity fund in the United States. Chuck oversees current and prospective portfolio investments for the firm and is Chair of the Investment Committee.Prior to TSG, Chuck was with Bain & Company, a leading management consulting company. Chuck received his BS, with top honors, in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an MBA from Stanford, where he was an Arjay Miller Scholar. He is a member of the Board of Trust of Vanderbilt University.




What inspired you to found TSG?The idea of a consumer-focused private fund was novel in 1987 when I started TSG, yet it made perfect sense to me to build a firm that had the skills and experience to bring a lot more than capital to the table.The idea of building a firm with a gender balance across all levels of the organization also made perfect sense to me based upon the varied perspectives of the team (and the fact that women make many of the buying decisions for our companies and products). I enjoy working with exceptionally smart, exceptionally creative, and exceptionally driven teams. I have my family and my work and I love both as well as the many professional and personal relationships that have been created through TSG.How has TSG’s culture helped drive the firm’s success?  Our culture is based upon applying the golden rule in every relationship. That needs to be the basis for any real partnership, internally and externally, and it is fundamental to building trust. We are very focused on working with entrepreneurs and teams that share these same values.What are the keys to building a successful brand?We invest in brands that have a clear purpose and values—which results in both meaning and authenticity for their consumers. Planet Fitness, for example, has an exceptional value position for its members because it provides a high-quality yet very affordable health club experience. The company is very focused on ensuring every member feels accepted and respected in a safe and energetic environment—and there are no hidden fees or long-term contracts. It’s everything that the health club industry was not.

Kellogg Conference Notebook: Keynote by Chuck Esserman, TSG Consumer Partners

The following was written by Joel Stanwood, a 2nd year MBA at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management. Joel has worked with two private equity growth-oriented funds, focusing on consumer products and healthcare/financial/business services. Prior to Kellogg, Joel served in strategic, operational, and general management roles at Siemens, was recruited into the firm’s international management development program and is certified as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt.
Keynote: Chuck Esserman, co-founder and CEO of TSG Consumer Partners
The 2010 Kellogg Private Equity and Venture Capital Conference was pleased to welcome Chuck Esserman, head of TSG Consumer Partners, to deliver the Private Equity Keynote Speech. TSG was founded in 1986 as the first PE fund solely focused on investing in middle-market, branded consumer product companies. The firm has raised five funds, and currently has $1.4 billion in capital under management. Given the overall theme of the conference, “Partnering Through Uncertainty: Unlocking Value in a Changing Landscape,” Esserman explained the unique TSG approach to unlock value.
He began by suggesting that TSG’s investment approach appears to look like a primer on how NOT do to private equity deals. However, the strategy has performed consistently well through multiple economic cycles. For example, the usual private equity investment philosophy is to seek firms with attractive purchase valuations (the lower the better), exchange downside protection for upside potential, avoid companies with low market share and seek a controlling ownership block. 





In contrast, TSG will pay top dollar for great companies, will exchange upside opportunity for downside protection to avoid negative investment returns, maintains focus on small and medium size companies that may have negligible market share (but always clear, differentiated consumer benefits), and is indifferent between purchasing a majority or a minority ownership stake. Furthermore, TSG uses little or no leverage, invests all company profits (or more) in growth, and will patiently court companies for years, if necessary. TSG will even provide interim marketing counsel and operational assistance….for free.
Somehow doing everything “wrong” has worked out quite well for TSG and its investors. On average, TSG portfolio companies increase annual operating income by 35% annually during the investment period, and portfolio operating income grew by 18% and 19% during the “Great Recession” years of 2008 and 2009, respectively. As a result, the cumulative enterprise value for recent investment exits was $3 billion, compared to only $300 million when purchased. Furthermore, TSG’s funds are oversubscribed: the firm turned down over $1 billion in LP commitments during its latest fund-raise.
The TSG team likes to find products that many would-be suitors dismiss as fads. Examples include Vitamin Water beverages, Smart Balance “better-for-you” foods and PureOlogy premium hair care products.
Esserman concluded by sharing some more general private equity insights. First, specialized operational expertise matters more than financial expertise, and that is true now more than ever. Second, restricted access to bank debt should be viewed as a positive thing, since it encourages reinvestment into company growth and reduces investment risk. Third, private equity fund returns will be increasingly correlated with growth rates of portfolio companies, and capital structures will need to change significantly. Finally, structured equity investments versus leveraged buyouts will become increasingly common for the foreseeable future. 





As for TSG, expect the firm to stick to its knitting: Continued focus on strong brands in the lower and middle market, cautious approach to leverage, and hands-on partnership with the best management teams in the industry.
