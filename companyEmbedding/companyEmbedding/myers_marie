Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

We enrolled our son in Aloha Angels Children Center when he was only 3 years old. Since then he has grown and matured into an amazing intelligent young man. Aloha Angel Director and teachers look at each child as an individual, with their own strengths and needs. My son has been blessed with awesome teachers who would understand his challenges, and handle him with grace. What my son has learned at Aloha Angels, as well as the warmth and respect towards others. Thank you so much for the attention and support that you have given my son over the years. As we are sad to say goodbye, because our son is going off to Middle School. I truly recommend Aloha Angels Children Center to all my friends and family and to all of you reading this post : )  Team Aloha Angels!!!Michelina Salon & SpaMichelle A. ratedresponding to Alex rI realize that having a autism child is difficult and only you and other parents realizes this but did you forget how long it took you to get patients for this behavior?  How can you expect a business to understand with a few hours of your child's behavior and get it. Slandering them is unexcepeabl and unfair for you to take out your fustrations  before you slander people step back and think how it was in the beginning for you learning how to deal with this  it takes a saint and you are one of them it's not easy!  But not every one knows how to cope with it  this place has heart and you are making it out to be a bad place because of your child that has very special needs not everyone knows how to handle am autism child it's very difficult and you should be the last person to judge  remember you hate people that judge your child at first so what gives you the right to judge someone else so quickly without knowing your child's conditions Brink Results IncMelanie M. ratedMelanie Marino, HR Manager for Sonny’s Enterprises (Manufacturing Industry).  Jackie Bridge from Brink Results has been instrumental in working with our Executive Managers and Supervisors in a coaching capacity.  Jackie works with our managers in utilizing PDP ProScans to aid us in recruiting and employee development.  PDP is a great tool that quickly enables us to match applicants to the job model we create in the PDP system.  We also utilize PDP to develop current employees within their current roles; it provides our managers with information regarding employees’ communication styles, motivators and natural behavior styles.  This helps them to understand their team, ultimately increasing employee satisfaction.Miracle EyebrowsMariam G. ratedHello Kim W. and napleskitty, Just responding to your reviews I apologize for your bad experiences. Usually our environment is very friendly and professional , we try to work with everyone's needs and ensure all customers leave happy and satisfied . Though on busy days it can get a little hectic we try to remain calm and collected. For that reason we do not schedule appointments, we are strictly walk in to keep everything fair. I'm hoping to meet you to change your prospective on this company. I hope you decide to give us a try again. If you come back remind us who you are so we can take extra care of you both. Thank you                                           Best regards, MariamMichelina Salon & SpaSherry Y. ratedI have been going to Michelina’s since 2012 after being referred by a neighbor.  I have been extremely happy with my hair color, cuts, and styles.  In addition, Gene provides excellent hair care advice and  shows sincere interest in his clients.  Michelina’s has recently expanded  adding a boutique and gift items and nail salon. These features are a welcome addition in an area still needing many more retail services.  Michelina’s is located at the north end of a strip mall around the corner from the section facing Gateway Blvd.  Currently a sandwich board on Gateway directs clients to the somewhat hidden location.Brink Results IncLorens A. ratedI have worked with the principals and several associates of Brinks Results since 2015. They have helped us develop our internal executive team as well as mangers in the field and this has allowed us to expand our business dramatically. One of the key tools that we have used to make better new hire selections as well as improve the performance of our key people is the Pro Scan surveys. We are much clearer today on what we are looking for from every new hire as well as existing staff. I recommend Brinks Results to any organization that is looking to grow their business.Head Gamesdroses72 ratedI went to this Salon on a last minute decision and I was so glad I did!!! My hairstylist was Ashley and she was awesome, she really knows what she is doing.  She corrected my brassy orange hair color and made it look so natural and beautiful.  The cut was very nice too, she cut it the way I asked her too without being talked out of it! Everyone there was very nice and pleasant; not once did I feel that the stylist were better than I! The prices were just right considering other salon prices. I will definitely be going back!!True Salongoatwomyn ratedI had an incredible European f...I had an incredible European facial with Kristina--incredibly relaxing, yet did not slack on the extractions and sound skin care. The facial also included a hand, neck and foot massage. Total bliss from a complete professional. I came to this salon because another business with which I had a Groupon, unfortunately, went out of business, and Groupon arranged for True Salon to honor the Groupon with the other business. True Salon was first class all the way, throughout the entire experience.Hair By Carlosgirl4u ratedI would disagree with the bad ...I would disagree with the bad review given by the client.  I had a wonderful experience there and Carlos had the know of what cut and style I needed.  His salon was at that time a bit torn up but has gone under a complete revamp.  His staff was cordial and I would compare him to the type of artist that are only found in NYC or Miami.  The salon looks great.Michelina Salon & SpaPatricia B. ratedI was very very pleased with the color and cut I received from MariEllis. I thought the price was a bit high but I guess you get what you pay for. i also liked the gift boutique area they have. Several rooms with a nice variety of well-priced jewelry and gift items. I will be going back. More expensive than my stylist up north but a good job.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
