 PRESS RELEASE 
SOLAR CAPITAL LTD. AND SOLAR SENIOR CAPITAL LTD. ANNOUNCE THE FORMATION OF A FIRST LIEN LIFE SCIENCE LOAN PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH
DEERFIELD MANAGEMENT  NEW YORK February 22, 2017Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital)
(NASDAQ-GS: SLRC) and Solar Senior Capital Ltd. (Solar Senior) (NASDAQ-GS: SUNS) today announced that they have formed Solar Life Science Program LLC
(LSJV) with Deerfield Management. Founded in 1994, Deerfield Management is a private investment firm with over $8 billion in assets under management. The firm specializes in healthcare investing, from seed stage to mature companies
across all segments of healthcare.  Including anticipated leverage, LSJVs total investable capital is expected to be approximately
$700 million. LSJV is expected to invest the majority of its assets in first lien loans to publicly-traded companies in the U.S. life science industry. Aside from the larger enterprise value of the targeted companies, the business model is
consistent with the loans currently being originated by Solar Capital Partners life science lending team.  Solar Capital, Solar Senior,
affiliates of the joint venture between Solar Capital Partners and PIMCO, and Deerfield Management have committed equity capital of up to $350 million to LSJV, subject to certain conditions. The individual organizations specific
commitments are $50 million, $75 million, $75 million and $150 million, respectively. Once a sufficient number of investments have been made, LSJV is expected to be levered up to approximately 1.0x
debt-to-equity, based on discussions with third party debt providers. LSJV is expected to generate a
mid-to-high-teens return on equity, consistent with the returns Solar Capital and Solar Senior have achieved on their realized life science investments to date. 
We are thrilled to add another initiative to our life science platform through this partnership with Deerfield Management, said Michael Gross,
Chairman and CEO of Solar Capital Ltd and Solar Senior Capital Ltd. LSJV enables our life science team to include public, later stage, larger enterprise value companies in our target market. In our opinion, these larger companies present an
attractive investment opportunity due to their more advanced product pipeline, as well as their access to public equity capital. We view Deerfields expertise in the healthcare sector as a valuable addition to the initiative. 
About Solar Capital Ltd.  Solar Capital Ltd. is a closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company invests primarily in leveraged, middle market companies in the
form of senior secured loans, unitranche loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities. 



                                The following information was filed by Solar Senior Capital Ltd. on Wednesday, February 22, 2017 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is a press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

suns_10k_2017-02-22_101_129Financial - ExpenseThe decrease in net expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the waiver of base management fees as well as reduced interest costs from both lower average borrowing year over year and the lack of Credit Facility amendment costs in 2016.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_20_48Financial - ExpenseIncentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods, among other factors.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_92_115Revenue - ProductWe generally measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_20_46Financial - ExpenseWe expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_100_123Financial - IncomeThe increase in gross investment income from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 is primarily due to growth of the income producing investment portfolio, including the continued growth of the FLLP portfolio.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_101_130Financial - ExpenseThe increase in net expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher interest costs, which included $0.8 million in expenses due to the Credit Facility amendment in May 2015, and higher management fees on a larger average portfolio over the course of the year as compared to the average portfolio size in 2014.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_77_86Other - OtherWithin the context of these critical accounting policies and disclosed subsequent events herein, we are not currently aware of any other reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
suns_10k_2017-02-22_91_233Other - OtherNet Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss
suns_10k_2017-02-22_6_7Financial - Shares / EquityOn February 24, 2011, we priced our initial public offering, selling 9.0 million shares, including the underwriters over-allotment, raising approximately $168 million in net proceeds.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Announce the Formation of a First Lien Life Science Loan Program in Partnership With Deerfield ManagementMarketwiredFebruary 22, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 22, 2017) - Solar Capital Ltd. ("Solar Capital") (  NASDAQ :  SLRC ) and Solar Senior Capital Ltd. ("Solar Senior") (  NASDAQ :  SUNS ) today announced that they have formed Solar Life Science Program LLC ("LSJV") with Deerfield Management. Founded in 1994, Deerfield Management is a private investment firm with over $8 billion in assets under management. The firm specializes in healthcare investing, from seed stage to mature companies across all segments of healthcare.Including anticipated leverage, LSJV's total investable capital is expected to be approximately $700 million. LSJV is expected to invest the majority of its assets in first lien loans to publicly-traded companies in the U.S. life science industry. Aside from the larger enterprise value of the targeted companies, the business model is consistent with the loans currently being originated by Solar Capital Partners' life science lending team.Solar Capital, Solar Senior, affiliates of the joint venture between Solar Capital Partners and PIMCO, and Deerfield Management have committed equity capital of up to $350 million to LSJV, subject to certain conditions. The individual organizations' specific commitments are $50 million, $75 million, $75 million and $150 million, respectively. Once a sufficient number of investments have been made, LSJV is expected to be levered up to approximately 1.0x debt-to-equity, based on discussions with third party debt providers. LSJV is expected to generate a mid-to-high-teens return on equity, consistent with the returns Solar Capital and Solar Senior have achieved on their realized life science investments to date."We are thrilled to add another initiative to our life science platform through this partnership with Deerfield Management," said Michael Gross, Chairman and CEO of Solar Capital Ltd and Solar Senior Capital Ltd. "LSJV enables our life science team to include public, later stage, larger enterprise value companies in our target market. In our opinion, these larger companies present an attractive investment opportunity due to their more advanced product pipeline, as well as their access to public equity capital. We view Deerfield's expertise in the healthcare sector as a valuable addition to the initiative."About Solar Capital Ltd.Solar Capital Ltd. is a closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
