President of American Express Abruptly Resigns


By KENNETH N. GILPIN


Published: September 28, 1995









                    In a surprise move, Jeffrey E. Stiefler, president of the American Express Company, abruptly tendered his resignation yesterday, telling the company he was leaving at the end of the month.        

                    Mr. Stiefler, who is 48, is a long-time associate of Harvey Golub, the company's chairman and chief executive. The two men spent much of the 1980's together at the company's IDS subsidiary, the Minneapolis-based mutual fund and financial planning company that is now called American Express Financial Advisors.        

                    In June 1993, after Mr. Golub was named to the top job, he tapped Mr. Stiefler, who at the time was running IDS, to come to New York as president. Together, the two men were the sole occupants of what the company called the office of the chief executive.        

                    In a letter that was distributed publicly as well as to American Express employees, Mr. Golub said Mr. Stiefler's resignation "is based on his longstanding desire to work at a less intense pace and in an environment that allows him to spend more time with his family."        

                    Mr. Golub said Mr. Stiefler intended to move to California, "and plans to pursue business opportunities in that part of the country."        

                    Michael O'Neill, a company spokesman, said Mr. Stiefler was not available for comment. Mr. Stiefler's resignation marks the second time he has left American Express, which he first joined a dozen years ago.        

                    In 1986, he quit his job as senior vice president for marketing at IDS to run the Meritor Savings Bank, a subsidiary of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. He returned in 1987 as executive vice president of sales and marketing at IDS.        

                    Analysts declined to talk on the record about Mr. Stiefler's resignation. But they said that despite its abrupt nature, the move was not that surprising.        

                    Over the last two years, Mr. Golub has made a number of moves that suggested that Mr. Stiefler's star was waning.        

                    In August 1993, Mr. Golub added a third executive to the office of chief executive, naming Jonathan S. Linen, 51, as vice chairman.        

                    This year, two more men have been moved into that office. In Janaury, Kenneth I. Chenault, 43, formerly president of travel and related services at American Express, was named vice chairman with responsibility for the company's consumer card and international businesses. And in April, Mr. Golub recruited George L. Farr, 54, a former colleague at McKinsey & Company, to join American Express as another vice chairman.        

                    "It was increasingly difficult for Stiefler to have an impact because of all these new contenders," one analyst said. "And increasingly, his name was not attached to important, highly visible projects."        

                    As president, Mr. Stiefler's principal responsibilities were overseeing the American Express Bank, an enterprise that its parent is now trying to sell, as well as American Express Financial Advisors.        

                    In his letter, Mr. Golub said the position of president would not be filled, and that Mr. Stiefler's responsibilities would be assumed by himself and the other members of the office of the chief executive.        

                    The analyst said: "The president's job isn't likely to be vacant for all that long. One day American Express will have a president again."        

                    News of Mr. Stiefler's resignation was released after the final bell at the New York Stock Exchange, where American Express stock closed at $43.25, down 25 cents a share.
