Institutional Mortgage Capital Canada Inc. Announces First Canadian CMBS since 2007
			  



























































 
















The CMBS Transaction Has an Aggregate Principal Balance of C$206,000,000


TORONTO, Feb. 3 /CNW/ - Institutional Mortgage Capital Canada Inc.
 ("IMC") is proud to announce it has completed a private placement of
 commercial mortgage backed securities ("CMBS") with an aggregate
 principal balance of C$206,000,000.  The transaction is the first CMBS
 deal issued in Canada since 2007.  The deal, entitled Institutional
 Mortgage Securities Canada Inc., Series 2011 ("IMSC 2011-1"), is backed
 by 16 loans to two of Canada's largest REITS, RioCan REIT and Calloway
 REIT.  The certificates were issued by Institutional Mortgage
 Securities Canada Inc., an affiliate of IMC, with TD Securities as the
 Lead Placement Agent.


"IMC is doing its part to help re-open the Canadian CMBS market," said
 IMC President and founder, John Ho.  "It's unfortunate that the
 Canadian market has lagged behind the US when Canadian bonds performed
 extraordinarily well even after 2007.  Where US CMBS is experiencing
 10% defaults, Canadian CMBS has had virtually 0% losses on the $24
 billion of CMBS issuance over the past 13 years."


"IMC plans to issue future CMBS deals in 2011 and expand our marketing
 to the US and international investors seeking the stability of Canadian
 credit," says Mr. Ho.  "We think this will expedite the return of the
 Canadian CMBS market and make it more efficient this time around."


IMSC 2011-1 is comprised of six investment grade classes and one
 weighted average coupon interest only certificate ("WAC IO").  The
 certificates were rated AAA to BBB in the DBRS pre-sale report released
 on January 21, 2011.  The AAA certificates have a 16.75% subordination
 level with fixed pass-through rates of 3.690% for the 5 year class and
 4.697% for the 10 year class.  The AA certificates have a pass through
 rate that is the lower of 5.259% and the net weighted average coupon
 ("NWAC") of the underlying mortgage portfolio while the A, BBB+, and
 BBB rated certificates have NWAC pass through rates.  All classes below
 the 5 year AAA have expected maturities of February 12, 2021, including
 the AAA rated WAC IO.


The underlying collateral for IMSC 2011-1 is comprised of 16 loans that
 are backed by anchored retail shopping centres owned by RioCan REIT and
 Calloway REIT, who are the dominant retail players in the Canadian
 landscape.  Anchor tenants include national retailers such as Walmart,
 Shoppers DrugMart, and Rona.  The loans have a 10 year term and a 30
 year amortization schedule with fixed rate coupons.  They are full
 recourse to each borrower, guaranteed by their respective REIT sponsor
 and do not allow for borrower prepayments. 


About Institutional Mortgage Capital Canada Inc.


Since inception in June 2009, IMC has raised over $320 million in
 capital from institutional and high net worth investors for investment
 in Canadian CMBS and Canadian commercial mortgage loans.  IMC also
 established Institutional Mortgage Servicing Canada Inc. ("IMS"), a
 fully operational servicing company with over C$750 million of
 servicing assignments.  While previously working together at Merrill
 Lynch, the IMC team built the first commercial mortgage backed lending
 program and managed 28 of the 65 Canadian CMBS conduit transactions
 from 1997-2007.  IMC looks to focus on commercial mortgage origination
 and new CMBS issuance in the future.

Canadian CMBS: "Low Hanging Fruit" For US Fixed Income Investors


















 



CRE Finance Council Launches CREFC Canada Chapter
September 17, 2015
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) - September 17, 2015 – Washington, D.C. based Commercial Real Estate Finance Council (CREFC) today expanded its global presence with the official inception of the CREFC Canada Chapter.
The Canada Chapter is being formed to bring CREFC’s trade association benefits and services to Canadian commercial real estate lenders, bond investors and loan servicers. The Canadian commercial real estate finance market is healthy and diversified yet, until today, been missing an industry platform on which to organize, associate, educate and advocate.

IMC Completes Sixth CMBS Transaction: Investors Again Recognize IMC Quality
March 6, 2015
Institutional Mortgage Capital ("IMC") announces the successful completion of its sixth Canadian CMBS issuance (Institutional Mortgage Securities Canada Inc., Series 2015-6, $325.4 million). With this transaction, IMC has now issued a total of $1.7 billion of new Canadian CMBS bonds since 2011.
IMC is the leading originator of Canadian CMBS and has a well-deserved reputation of bringing new issues to market that feature strong and uniform underwriting fundamentals across its entire mortgage pool.  The IMSCI 2015-6 transaction continues this practice with 100% of the mortgage pool being originated by IMC.

With this transaction, IMC has now issued a total of $1.339 billion of new Canadian CMBS bonds since 2011. The IMSCI 2014-5 transaction is the third Canadian CMBS deal in the past 12 months to be marketed in both Canada and the United States and generated strong interest from U.S. investors who acquired more than 35% of the bonds.  In addition, almost 50% of the bonds were sold to new investors who had not previously purchased CMBS bonds off the IMSCI shelf.  The deal was supported by a strong syndicate comprising seven dealers across Canada and the U.S. and was jointly led by RBC Capital Markets (structuring lead), J.P. Morgan Securities and National Bank Financial.

Canadian CMBS: "Low Hanging Fruit" For US Fixed Income Investors
October 5, 2013
Canadian CMBS investors are a very happy group; and no wonder - it can't really get much better. Canadian CMBS has a pristine credit record, with only 0.087% of cumulative losses from market inception (1998), and a current delinquency rate (0.27%) that is lost in rounding. It pays on time - 98.1% (by dollar value) of all Canadian CMBS loans have repaid at or within 120 days of scheduled maturity. Furthermore, Canadian CMBS has been "stress tested" - Canadian CMBS investment grade bonds proved to be far more resilient to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and recovered their value much more quickly than U.S. CMBS bonds and many other credit products. On top of everything else, the new issue Canadian AAA and A CMBS are currently trading at a discount to U.S. CMBS bonds (with up to an 18 to 34 bp pickup in spread to investors). For U.S. investors, or frankly any non-Canadian investor, who wishes to diversify their portfolios, new issue investment grade Canadian CMBS is truly the "low hanging fruit" in this market.

CMBS Start Long Recovery to Respectability
January 21, 2013
Commercial mortgage back securities make a $500 million comeback
Canadian commercial property owners have relatively few sources of term financing compared to their US counterparts. Of course, it helps that the US commercial mortgage universe is roughly 15 times the size of the Canadian market, but even on a dollar adjusted basis, Canadian borrowers are hardly spoiled for choice.
Pursuing commercial mortgage financing, Canadian borrowers have long had the option of turning to a portfolio lender. Portfolio lenders lend with the intention of holding a mortgage from funding through to maturity. It's a category dominated by a handful of financial institutions, insurance companies and public and private investment managers, that has managed to scoop up the majority of the Canadian commercial mortgage origination market year over year since the early days of real estate finance. A borrower's other option is to finance through a conduit. That is, a lender who lends with a view to selling the mortgage on or shortly after funding. Prior to 2007, the majority of commercial mortgages originated by conduit lenders were packaged into CMBS (commercial mortgage backed securities) pools and sold to institutional investors.
Simply put, CMBS is a vehicle through which fixed income investors lend to real estate borrowers.

Mortgage Deal Revives Stalled Securities Market
January 2011
Canada’s moribund commercial mortgage-backed securities market is awakening from a three-year slumber.
Two major real estate companies are tapping the market for $206-million in the first deal of its kind since 2007, signalling that investors are returning to a sector they had abandoned over worries about the health of the country’s commercial real estate market.
Prior to the recession, Canadian real estate companies went to the CMBS market for about $4-billion a year in low-cost financing. The market literally vanished as lendersretreated and investors shunned higher-risk securities, forcing real estate companies to obtain mortgages almost exclusively from large banks.
The resurgence could make it cheaper for real estate companies to raise the money they need to expand their portfolios, driving up property values as more bidders vie forbuildings. It will also give investors other than banks the chance to add secured mortgages to their portfolios.
