Why did you choose your line of work?
I loved the dynamic nature of the industry and the ability to meet people from all walks of life and geographic regions. Hospitality is progressive, traditional, creative and challenging, and it always offers opportunity.





How do you use social media in relation to your work?
In my role, is it is more monitoring and reactive rather than engaging and connecting with the guests, which is really the objective. The company has staff dedicated to social media, and I am still learning about it — mostly from my kids and the younger generations.
What do you like best about interacting with the public?
Everything. I spend most of my time with the staff to help understand what they need to serve the guests and run the business. Today, we need to make a personal connection on all levels of the business, and the associates always make the difference.
What is your favorite time of year in Louisville?
I have only been in Louisville four months, which is somewhat limited, but I have loved it all thus far. The best “time” I have had has been Thunder Over Louisville, without a doubt. What a great event for the city and a great way to kick off the Derby Festival.

What advice would you give to someone who wants to build a career similar to yours?
You must truly have the “calling” and have a servant’s heart. Nothing ever replaces hard work, being genuine and embracing your individuality, but you have to work with the team. Finally, build a solid foundation and culture of service to all, while realizing that the associates run the business.
Describe an experience with a customer that was very gratifying to you.
A group was arriving in Naples, Fla., and an attendee had a serious accident on the drive from Miami. When they arrived at 12 a.m., they had no car, no luggage, clothes or cash and had not eaten in hours. The staff opened the boutique to get them clothes, opened the kitchen and fed the guests, and showed amazing care and concern. The best part was, they did not feel the need to call and ask permission but just took care of the guest. The achievement of the team is always the most gratifying part of my job.
What do you wish more customers understood about the way your business operates?
That all the associates are really working as hard as they can to make their guest’s stay, their event or their meal the best they can possibly can. Every guest has different expectations, and we work as hard as we can to meet all of their needs.
Why is a career in your industry a good choice?




 


The hotel business is one of the few industries where we take raw products, produce the final product and sell it directly to the consumer (guest) for final consumption. If you are creative or analytical, technical or sales-driven, a morning or night person, the industry offers jobs to every degree. I have loved this industry from the day I started as a door host at the Ramada Inn I-70 Northwest in Denver.
