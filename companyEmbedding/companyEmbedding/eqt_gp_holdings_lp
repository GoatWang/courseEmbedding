                   Investor Relations              





      Overview          

EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) conducts its business through two business segments: EQT Production and EQT Midstream. EQT Production has been a major player in the Appalachian Basin for over 125 years.  EQT owns approximately 3.6 million gross acres – including approximately 790,000 gross acres in the Marcellus play, more than 13,600 gross productive wells, and 13.5 trillion cubic feet of proved natural gas, NGL, and crude oil reserves. EQT continues to be a leader in the use of advanced horizontal drilling technology – designed to minimize the potential impact of drilling-related activities and reduce the overall environmental footprint. Through safe and responsible operations, the Company is committed to meeting the country’s growing demand for clean-burning energy. EQT is seizing opportunities created by the Appalachian Basin’s growing production of natural gas and other energy products. In 2015, EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) was formed to own partnership interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP, (NYSE: EQM), a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQT Midstream Partners provides midstream services to EQT and third-party companies through its strategically located transmission, storage, and gathering systems that service the Marcellus and Utica regions. EQT Midstream Partners owns approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated interstate pipelines; and also owns more than 1,800 miles of high- and low-pressure gathering lines that have multiple delivery interconnects with the transmission and storage system. EQT owns a 90% interest in EQT GP Holdings. EQT GP Holdings owns the general partner interest, all of the incentive distribution rights, and a portion of the limited partner interests in EQT Midstream Partners.

About Us

EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by EQT Corporation to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQM provides substantially all of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services under contracts with long-term, firm reservation and/or usage fees. This contract structure enhances the stability of EQM’s cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.
 
 
 
EQM’s operations are primarily focused in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, a strategic location in the natural gas shale plays known as the Marcellus, Upper Devonian, and Utica Shales. This same region is also the core operating area of EQT, EQM’s largest customer that accounted for approximately 75% of EQM’s revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
 
 
EQM provides midstream services to EQT and multiple third parties across 24 counties in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio through its two primary assets: the gathering system, which delivers natural gas from wells and other receipt points to transmission pipelines, and the transmission and storage system, which serves as a header system transmission pipeline. EQM believes that its strategically located assets, combined with its working relationship with EQT, position it as a leading Appalachian Basin midstream energy company.
 
 
 
The principal business objective for EQT Midstream Partners is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that it pays to our unitholders over time, while ensuring the ongoing stability of its business. EQM intends to achieve this objective by capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities; increasing access to existing and new delivery markets; attracting additional third party volumes; and focusing on stable, fixed-fee business.




EQT GP Holdings, LP  (EQGP)is a limited partnership formed by EQT in 2015 to own EQT's partnership interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP. EQT is the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM. EQGP’s only cash-generating assets are its partnership interests in EQM, comprised of a 26.6% limited partner interest, a 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights in EQM. As of December 31, 2016, EQT owned a 90.1% limited partner interest in EQGP and 100% of the non-economic general partner interest in EQGP.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



D Value | A Growth | B Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
