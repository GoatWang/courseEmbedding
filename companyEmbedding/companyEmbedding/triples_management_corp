Short Interest Moves 39.8% Lower For GTS
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 03/31/2017 settlement date, which shows a 556,003 share decrease in total short interest for Triple-S Management Corp , to 840,192, a decrease of 39.82% since 03/15/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.
