Sports Direct International plc’s turnaround hits the back of the net

Harvey Jones | Thursday, 20th July, 2017 | More on:  ASC SPD

Mike Ashley unveils a 60% drop in company profits and the share price jumps 8.41% in early trading. Isn’t that just typical of Britain’s most controversial chief executive? This morning’s preliminary finals from Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD) have scored with investors. How does he do it?
This sporting life
Naturally, it is all about expectations. City analysts were forecasting a healthy 10% increase in revenues to £3.18bn but with pre-tax profits likely to halve, and that is pretty much what they got. Investors already knew that Sports Direct had been hit hard by the higher minimum wage and falling pound, but were encouraged by signs of a brighter future,…

Mike Ashley unveils a 60% drop in company profits and the share price jumps 8.41% in early trading. Isn’t that just typical of Britain’s most controversial chief executive? This morning’s preliminary finals from Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD) have scored with investors. How does he do it?
This sporting life
Naturally, it is all about expectations. City analysts were forecasting a healthy 10% increase in revenues to £3.18bn but with pre-tax profits likely to halve, and that is pretty much what they got. Investors already knew that Sports Direct had been hit hard by the higher minimum wage and falling pound, but were encouraged by signs of a brighter future, and the appointment of a new finance director.
Preliminary results for the year ended 30 April 2017 showed group revenue up 11.7% to £3.25bn, beating forecasts, but with  underlying profit before tax down a massive 58.7% to £113.7m, largely as expected. Revenues looked healthy with 6.3% growth in UK sports retail to £2.14bn, while international sports retail revenue rose a more impressive 38% to £665.6m.
Ash cash
The market was also cheered by the optimistic outlook, with Sports Direct aiming to achieve growth in underlying EBITDA growth of between 5% and 15% in the full-year 2018. 
Mike Ashley continues to pursue his dream of turning Sports Direct into the “Selfridges” of sport by migrating to a new generation of stores to showcase products from its third party brand partners. “We have invested over £300m in property over the last year, and I am pleased to report that early indications show that trading in our new flagship stores is exceeding expectations,” he said. 
Direct equity
He also assured investors that he will conservatively manage the sterling/dollar volatility that hammered full-year EBITDA while warning that like many UK retailers, the company remains exposed to currency fluctuations. He also announced the appointment of new chief financial officer Jon Kempster, formerly finance director of logistics and distribution group Wincanton.
Despite today’s good cheer, Sports Direct still has a fight on its hands, as it battles shareholder and politician concerns about corporate governance and UK working conditions, with shoppers also squeezed by stagnant wages and rising inflation. However, analysts praised its recent move to acquire a 26% stake in video games retailer Game Digital, which has similar customer demographics, and all eyes are now on its $100 million US venture.
Sports Direct may be a winner today, but with earnings per share (EPS) forecast to drop another 17% in 2018, and pre-tax profits possibly falling below £100m, tomorrow will still be tough. 
Fashion fun
Online fashion retailer ASOS (LSE: ASC) might tempt those looking for a faster growth story, with the company recently reporting a 32% rise in sales in the four months to the end of June, with international revenue up 44%. The group expects sales growth for the current financial year to be at the upper end of its 30%-35% range.
Sales rose 16% in the UK but really delivered the goods in the US and EU, where they flew 38% and 41% respectively, and 54% in the rest of the world. The number of active customers is rising sharply, while EPS are forecast to rise 23% in 2017, and 29% in 2018. ASOS is a thrilling growth story, the big question is whether you are willing to buy in at today’s forecast valuation of 75 times earnings.

Mike Ashley has made mistakes over the years, but he isn't the only one. The most important thing is that you learn from them.
This must-read Motley Fool report, Worst Mistakes Investors Make, looks at some of the costliest investment blunders and sets out how you can avoid them.
It is absolutely free and explains why, say, you should not sell winners too early and should avoid going all-on one stock.

Sports Direct International plc’s turnaround hits the back of the net

Harvey Jones | Thursday, 20th July, 2017 | More on:  ASC SPD

Mike Ashley unveils a 60% drop in company profits and the share price jumps 8.41% in early trading. Isn’t that just typical of Britain’s most controversial chief executive? This morning’s preliminary finals from Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD) have scored with investors. How does he do it?
This sporting life
Naturally, it is all about expectations. City analysts were forecasting a healthy 10% increase in revenues to £3.18bn but with pre-tax profits likely to halve, and that is pretty much what they got. Investors already knew that Sports Direct had been hit hard by the higher minimum wage and falling pound, but were encouraged by signs of a brighter future,…

Mike Ashley unveils a 60% drop in company profits and the share price jumps 8.41% in early trading. Isn’t that just typical of Britain’s most controversial chief executive? This morning’s preliminary finals from Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD) have scored with investors. How does he do it?
This sporting life
Naturally, it is all about expectations. City analysts were forecasting a healthy 10% increase in revenues to £3.18bn but with pre-tax profits likely to halve, and that is pretty much what they got. Investors already knew that Sports Direct had been hit hard by the higher minimum wage and falling pound, but were encouraged by signs of a brighter future, and the appointment of a new finance director.
Preliminary results for the year ended 30 April 2017 showed group revenue up 11.7% to £3.25bn, beating forecasts, but with  underlying profit before tax down a massive 58.7% to £113.7m, largely as expected. Revenues looked healthy with 6.3% growth in UK sports retail to £2.14bn, while international sports retail revenue rose a more impressive 38% to £665.6m.
Ash cash
The market was also cheered by the optimistic outlook, with Sports Direct aiming to achieve growth in underlying EBITDA growth of between 5% and 15% in the full-year 2018. 
Mike Ashley continues to pursue his dream of turning Sports Direct into the “Selfridges” of sport by migrating to a new generation of stores to showcase products from its third party brand partners. “We have invested over £300m in property over the last year, and I am pleased to report that early indications show that trading in our new flagship stores is exceeding expectations,” he said. 
Direct equity
He also assured investors that he will conservatively manage the sterling/dollar volatility that hammered full-year EBITDA while warning that like many UK retailers, the company remains exposed to currency fluctuations. He also announced the appointment of new chief financial officer Jon Kempster, formerly finance director of logistics and distribution group Wincanton.
Despite today’s good cheer, Sports Direct still has a fight on its hands, as it battles shareholder and politician concerns about corporate governance and UK working conditions, with shoppers also squeezed by stagnant wages and rising inflation. However, analysts praised its recent move to acquire a 26% stake in video games retailer Game Digital, which has similar customer demographics, and all eyes are now on its $100 million US venture.
Sports Direct may be a winner today, but with earnings per share (EPS) forecast to drop another 17% in 2018, and pre-tax profits possibly falling below £100m, tomorrow will still be tough. 
Fashion fun
Online fashion retailer ASOS (LSE: ASC) might tempt those looking for a faster growth story, with the company recently reporting a 32% rise in sales in the four months to the end of June, with international revenue up 44%. The group expects sales growth for the current financial year to be at the upper end of its 30%-35% range.
Sales rose 16% in the UK but really delivered the goods in the US and EU, where they flew 38% and 41% respectively, and 54% in the rest of the world. The number of active customers is rising sharply, while EPS are forecast to rise 23% in 2017, and 29% in 2018. ASOS is a thrilling growth story, the big question is whether you are willing to buy in at today’s forecast valuation of 75 times earnings.

Mike Ashley has made mistakes over the years, but he isn't the only one. The most important thing is that you learn from them.
This must-read Motley Fool report, Worst Mistakes Investors Make, looks at some of the costliest investment blunders and sets out how you can avoid them.
It is absolutely free and explains why, say, you should not sell winners too early and should avoid going all-on one stock.

Can the supertanker Unilever ride the crest of a wave? Can a Newcastle United owner change his stripes?




Lots of lolly














 






	If it’s dependably dull you want, Unilever’s half-year results on Thursday should fit the bill.

	If it’s off the wall you are after, there’s always Sports Direct International PLC (LON:SPD), which releases full-year figures.

	A frisson of excitement might also be evident in low-cost airline easyJet’s statement, after chief executive Carolyn McCall’s decision to jump ship and join ITV.

	Looking for some Unileverage

	Following the short-lived takeover approach from Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) earlier this year, Unilever PLC (LON:ULVR) unveiled its ‘Connected 4 Growth’ programme aimed at improving shareholder value.

	That programme included targets such as boosting underlying margins to 20% by 2020, so investors will be looking to see what progress is being made under this new strategy.

	Eyes will also be focused on business in Latin America, an exciting, high-growth potential area for Unilever but one that has been beset by macroeconomic troubles recently, particularly in Brazil, as was evident in the first quarter.

	Last month’s acquisition of Hourglass, a luxury cosmetics brand, took Unilever even further into the premium personal care market following on from other recent deals in skin and hair care, so it will be interesting to see how that division is coming along.

	Revenues are expected to rise 6% from last year to €27.9bn, with the company hoping to deliver underlying growth within its 3-5% target range - something it just failed to do in the first quarter.

	Headline operating profit is tipped to rise to €4.2bn from €3.8bn a year ago, or €4.7bn (vs €3.9bn in 2016) once restructuring costs and other one-offs are accounted for.

Sports Direct taking a pounding from sterling's weakness

	“Premium” is not a term one immediately associates with Sports Direct, but founder Mike Ashley is not afraid to take a stake in any retailer, no matter what market it addresses, as his company’s recent acquisition of a 25% stake in struggling video games retailer Game Digital PLC (LON:GMD) demonstrated.

	The company has also had a dabble in the affairs of fashion outfit French Connection (LON:FCCN), department store chain Debenhams(LON:DEBS), home shopping specialist Findel PLC (LON:FDL) and sportswear rival JD Sports PLC (LON:JD.).

	Ashley wants to turn Sports Direct into the “Selfridges of sports retail”; we know leopards can’t change their spots, but can the owner of Newcastle United football club change his stripes?

	In an effort to boost business, Sports Direct has been expanding its portfolio with the acquisition of 50 stores in the US under the Bob’s Stores and Eastern Mountain Stores brands.

	Liberum expects the FTSE 250 retailer to report a fall in full year adjusted pre-tax profit to £126mln, down from £275mln on the back of its acquisition spree and the hit from a weaker pound, while sales are forecast to rise to £3.1bn from £2.9bn.

	The group’s first-half results in December saw Sports Direct report a 57% slump in profits, battered by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote.

	The third-quarter trading update from easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) on Thursday will give an idea of the strength of summer trading for the discount airline after a weak first-half performance due to a combination of currency pressures from the weaker pound and the later timing of Easter.

	No thrills airline

	Days after revealing that it is looking for approval to establish a new airline headquartered in Vienna, to enable it to continue to operate flights both across Europe and domestically within European countries after Brexit, easyJet should see a better performance with summer 2016 having been impacted by the EU vote uncertainties.

	With the weak first-half numbers in July, McCall noted that increased bookings this year reflected “growing evidence that consumers are prioritising expenditure on flights and holidays above other non-essential items”.

	Recent results from the airlines have been strong, noted Neil Wilson at ETX Capital.

	“After a turbulent period throughout 2016 it does look like the sector is enjoying favourable tailwinds, albeit against a comparable period that was tougher,” he noted.

	Significant announcements expected

	Interims: Howden Joinery Group PLC (LON:HWDN), Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (LON:MONY), Nichols PLC (LON:NICL), Severstal (LON:SVST), Unilever PLC (LON:ULVR)

	Finals: Sports Direct International PLC (LON:SPD)

	Trading statements: Anglo American PLC (LON:AAG), easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), Premier Foods PLC (LON:PFD), SSE plc (LON:SSE)

	Heavyweights going ex-dividend: Vedanta and SSE
