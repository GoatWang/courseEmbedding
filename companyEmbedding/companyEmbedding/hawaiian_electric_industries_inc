HECO power plant at Kahe Point in West Oahu


Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc.. (HEI; NYSE: HE) is the largest supplier of electricity in the state of Hawaii, supplying power to 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities: Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited. In addition, HEI owns a financial institution serving Hawaii, American Savings Bank.[1] (The island of Kauai is the only island in the state not supplied by HEI. Instead, the consumer-owned Kauai Island Utility Cooperative manages the island's electricity.)
HECO, HELCO, and MECO employ more than 2,000 people. Approximately 20,000 Hawaii residents are shareholders of HECO’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI).[2] The company is headquartered in Honolulu. The net income of the company reached 164 million dollars by the end of 2012 with a yearly revenue of 3.4 billion dollars.[3]

History[edit]
Hawaiian Electric Company (often abbreviated HECO, pronounced HEE-coh) incorporated on October 13, 1891.[4] Within about 16 years the utility had 2,500 customers on the island of Oahu. By 1914 HECO had started rural service to the windward side of the island and was marketing electric products like refrigerators and flat irons. By 1937 HECO broke ground on its second power plant, and transmission lines soon crisscrossed Oahu.[5]
War and statehood[edit]
During World War II HECO power plants, now linked to busy military bases, generated more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity each day.
Hawaii became a state in 1959, and by then the entire island of Oahu was electrified. Massive power plants, some still in operation today, came online. HECO flipped the switch on a 116 MW plant in downtown Honolulu in 1954. The state's first reheat steam turbine generator went on line at Kahe on the west coast of Oahu. Today, Kahe is the state's largest plant with a total generating capacity of 650 MW.
Island expansion[edit]
HECO purchased Maui Electric Company (abbreviated MECO and pronounced ME-coh) in 1968. In 1970 HECO also acquired the Big Island's Hilo Electric Light Company (later to be renamed Hawaii Electric Light Company, abbreviated HELCO and pronounced HEL-coh). MECO had expansion plans of its own. In 1988, it acquired the Lanai City power plant on the island of Lanai, and in 1989, Molokai Electric Company on the island of Molokai. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.[1] At the moment,[when?] HECO is developing a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki, to ensure a reliable electrical supply.[6]
On December 4, 2014, NextEra Energy tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.[7] On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.[8] The merger included plans to convert HEI's oil-fired generating plants to run on natural gas, which were to use liquified natural gas imported from a British Columbia plant of FortisBC. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.[9]
Generation[edit]
In 2016 HECO produced 8.8 TWh, of which 2.3 TWh were renewable.[10] Most of the power came from oil, using 8.5 million barrels in 2016, down from 10.7 million barrels in 2008.[11]

Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.[1] At the moment,[when?] HECO is developing a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki, to ensure a reliable electrical supply.[6]
On December 4, 2014, NextEra Energy tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.[7] On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.[8] The merger included plans to convert HEI's oil-fired generating plants to run on natural gas, which were to use liquified natural gas imported from a British Columbia plant of FortisBC. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.[9]
Generation[edit]
In 2016 HECO produced 8.8 TWh, of which 2.3 TWh were renewable.[10] Most of the power came from oil, using 8.5 million barrels in 2016, down from 10.7 million barrels in 2008.[11]

HECO power plant at Kahe Point in West Oahu


Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc.. (HEI; NYSE: HE) is the largest supplier of electricity in the state of Hawaii, supplying power to 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities: Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited. In addition, HEI owns a financial institution serving Hawaii, American Savings Bank.[1] (The island of Kauai is the only island in the state not supplied by HEI. Instead, the consumer-owned Kauai Island Utility Cooperative manages the island's electricity.)
HECO, HELCO, and MECO employ more than 2,000 people. Approximately 20,000 Hawaii residents are shareholders of HECO’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI).[2] The company is headquartered in Honolulu. The net income of the company reached 164 million dollars by the end of 2012 with a yearly revenue of 3.4 billion dollars.[3]

History[edit]
Hawaiian Electric Company (often abbreviated HECO, pronounced HEE-coh) incorporated on October 13, 1891.[4] Within about 16 years the utility had 2,500 customers on the island of Oahu. By 1914 HECO had started rural service to the windward side of the island and was marketing electric products like refrigerators and flat irons. By 1937 HECO broke ground on its second power plant, and transmission lines soon crisscrossed Oahu.[5]
War and statehood[edit]
During World War II HECO power plants, now linked to busy military bases, generated more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity each day.
Hawaii became a state in 1959, and by then the entire island of Oahu was electrified. Massive power plants, some still in operation today, came online. HECO flipped the switch on a 116 MW plant in downtown Honolulu in 1954. The state's first reheat steam turbine generator went on line at Kahe on the west coast of Oahu. Today, Kahe is the state's largest plant with a total generating capacity of 650 MW.
Island expansion[edit]
HECO purchased Maui Electric Company (abbreviated MECO and pronounced ME-coh) in 1968. In 1970 HECO also acquired the Big Island's Hilo Electric Light Company (later to be renamed Hawaii Electric Light Company, abbreviated HELCO and pronounced HEL-coh). MECO had expansion plans of its own. In 1988, it acquired the Lanai City power plant on the island of Lanai, and in 1989, Molokai Electric Company on the island of Molokai. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.[1] At the moment,[when?] HECO is developing a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki, to ensure a reliable electrical supply.[6]
On December 4, 2014, NextEra Energy tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.[7] On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.[8] The merger included plans to convert HEI's oil-fired generating plants to run on natural gas, which were to use liquified natural gas imported from a British Columbia plant of FortisBC. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.[9]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

        HONOLULU, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (American), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) (NYSE - HE) today reported net income of $16.7 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $15.8 million in the first, or linked, quarter of 2017 and $13.3 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
      

        'We continued our strong performance into the second quarter, delivering well for our customers, the bank, and for shareholders.  Our results through the second quarter demonstrate broad improvement in our profitability with better yields, efficiency, asset quality, and bottom line return on equity compared to last year,' said Richard Wacker, president and chief executive officer of American. 'Our balance sheet continued to grow nicely as customers entrusted us with more of their deposits. Total lending was flat as our work to improve commercial loan asset quality offset growth we saw in consumer, home equity, residential, and commercial real estate lending.' 
      

        Second quarter of 2017 net income of $16.7 million was $3.4 million higher than the second quarter of 2016 and $0.9 million higher than the first (linked) quarter of 2017. 
      

        Compared to the second quarter of 2016, the $3.4 million increase was primarily driven by $3 million (after-tax) higher net interest income mainly due to growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios as well as the deployment of deposit growth into our investment portfolio.  The $1 million (after-tax) lower provision for loan losses was offset by $1 million (after-tax) higher non-interest expense.
      

        Compared to the linked first quarter of 2017, the $0.9 million increase was primarily driven by the following on an after-tax basis:
      

          $1 million higher net interest income driven mainly by higher loan portfolio yields and growth in our consumer loan and investment portfolios;
        

          $1 million lower provision for loan losses; and
        

          $1 million higher noninterest income mainly due to improved performance from bank-owned life insurance investments.
        

        These increases were offset by $2 million (after-tax) higher noninterest expense primarily due to higher compensation and benefits.
      

        Net interest income (pretax) was $55.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $54.8 million in the linked quarter and $51.0 million in the prior year quarter.  Net interest margin was 3.68% in the second quarter of 2017, unchanged from the linked quarter and 3.58% in the second quarter of 2016.  The higher net interest margin compared to the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to higher investment portfolio yields and growth of our higher yielding consumer and commercial real estate portfolios.
      

        The provision for loan losses (pretax) was $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $3.9 million in the linked quarter and $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.  The decrease from the linked quarter reflected improved credit quality.  The second quarter of 2017 net charge-off ratio was 0.21%, compared to 0.29% in the linked quarter and 0.15% in the prior year quarter.  Nonaccrual loans as a percent of total loans receivable held for investment was 0.44% compared to 0.41% in the linked quarter and 1.02% in the prior year quarter.  
      

        Noninterest income (pretax) was $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $15.1 million in the linked quarter and $16.6 million in the prior year quarter. Noninterest expense (pretax) was $44.6 million compared to $41.9 million in the linked quarter and $42.6 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
      

        Total loans were $4.7 billion at June 30, 2017 and included growth in the consumer, home equity line of credit, and residential loan portfolios during the second quarter of 2017.
      



________________________




Note:  Amounts indicated as 'after-tax' in this earnings release are based upon adjusting items for the composite statutory tax rate of 40% for the bank.




        Total deposits were $5.7 billion at June 30, 2017, an increase of $175 million or 6.3% annualized from December 31, 2016.  Low-cost core deposits increased $143 million or 5.8% annualized from December 31, 2016.  The average cost of funds was 0.21% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 0.20% for the first quarter of 2017 and 0.23% for the second quarter of 2016.
      

        American's return on average equity was 11.3% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 10.8% in the linked quarter and 9.2% in the second quarter of 2016.  Return on average assets was 1.02% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 0.98% in the linked quarter and 0.86% in the same quarter last year.  American's solid results enabled it to pay dividends of $9.4 million to HEI while maintaining healthy capital levels, including a leverage ratio of 8.5% and a total capital ratio of 13.7% at June 30, 2017.
      

HEI EARNINGS RELEASE, HEI WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS EARNINGS AND 2017 EPS GUIDANCEConcurrent with American's regulatory filing 30 days after the end of the quarter, American announced its second quarter 2017 financial results today.  Please note that these reported results relate only to American and are not necessarily indicative of HEI's consolidated financial results for the second quarter of 2017.
      

        HEI plans to announce its second quarter 2017 consolidated financial results on Thursday, August 3, 2017 and will conduct a webcast and conference call to discuss its consolidated earnings, including American's earnings, and 2017 EPS guidance on Thursday, August 3, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. Hawaii time (3:00 p.m. Eastern time). 
      

        Interested parties within the United States may listen to the conference by calling (844) 834-0652 and international parties may listen to the conference by calling (412) 317-5198.

(Hawaiian Electric) intend to continue to use HEI's website as a means of disclosing additional information.  Such disclosures will be included on HEI's website in the Investor Relations section.  Accordingly, investors should routinely monitor such portions of HEI's website, in addition to following HEI's, Hawaiian Electric's and American's press releases, HEI's and Hawaiian Electric's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and HEI's public conference calls and webcasts.  The information on HEI's website is not incorporated by reference in this document or in HEI's and Hawaiian Electric's SEC filings unless, and except to the extent, specifically incorporated by reference.  Investors may also wish to refer to the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) website at dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms in order to review documents filed with and issued by the PUC.  No information on the PUC website is incorporated by reference in this document or in HEI's and Hawaiian Electric's SEC filings.
      

        An on-line replay of the August 3, 2017 webcast will be available on HEI's website beginning about two hours after the event.  Replays of the conference call will also be available approximately two hours after the event through August 17, 2017 by dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 and entering passcode:  10108918.
      

        HEI supplies power to approximately 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities, Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited and provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through American, one of Hawaii's largest financial institutions.

HECO power plant at Kahe Point in West Oahu


Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc.. (HEI; NYSE: HE) is the largest supplier of electricity in the state of Hawaii, supplying power to 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities: Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited. In addition, HEI owns a financial institution serving Hawaii, American Savings Bank.[1] (The island of Kauai is the only island in the state not supplied by HEI. Instead, the consumer-owned Kauai Island Utility Cooperative manages the island's electricity.)
HECO, HELCO, and MECO employ more than 2,000 people. Approximately 20,000 Hawaii residents are shareholders of HECO’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI).[2] The company is headquartered in Honolulu. The net income of the company reached 164 million dollars by the end of 2012 with a yearly revenue of 3.4 billion dollars.[3]

History[edit]
Hawaiian Electric Company (often abbreviated HECO, pronounced HEE-coh) incorporated on October 13, 1891.[4] Within about 16 years the utility had 2,500 customers on the island of Oahu. By 1914 HECO had started rural service to the windward side of the island and was marketing electric products like refrigerators and flat irons. By 1937 HECO broke ground on its second power plant, and transmission lines soon crisscrossed Oahu.[5]
War and statehood[edit]
During World War II HECO power plants, now linked to busy military bases, generated more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity each day.
Hawaii became a state in 1959, and by then the entire island of Oahu was electrified. Massive power plants, some still in operation today, came online. HECO flipped the switch on a 116 MW plant in downtown Honolulu in 1954. The state's first reheat steam turbine generator went on line at Kahe on the west coast of Oahu. Today, Kahe is the state's largest plant with a total generating capacity of 650 MW.
Island expansion[edit]
HECO purchased Maui Electric Company (abbreviated MECO and pronounced ME-coh) in 1968. In 1970 HECO also acquired the Big Island's Hilo Electric Light Company (later to be renamed Hawaii Electric Light Company, abbreviated HELCO and pronounced HEL-coh). MECO had expansion plans of its own. In 1988, it acquired the Lanai City power plant on the island of Lanai, and in 1989, Molokai Electric Company on the island of Molokai. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.[1] At the moment,[when?] HECO is developing a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki, to ensure a reliable electrical supply.[6]
On December 4, 2014, NextEra Energy tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.[7] On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.[8] The merger included plans to convert HEI's oil-fired generating plants to run on natural gas, which were to use liquified natural gas imported from a British Columbia plant of FortisBC. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.[9]
Generation[edit]
In 2016 HECO produced 8.8 TWh, of which 2.3 TWh were renewable.[10] Most of the power came from oil, using 8.5 million barrels in 2016, down from 10.7 million barrels in 2008.[11]

HECO power plant at Kahe Point in West Oahu


Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc.. (HEI; NYSE: HE) is the largest supplier of electricity in the state of Hawaii, supplying power to 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities: Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited. In addition, HEI owns a financial institution serving Hawaii, American Savings Bank.[1] (The island of Kauai is the only island in the state not supplied by HEI. Instead, the consumer-owned Kauai Island Utility Cooperative manages the island's electricity.)
HECO, HELCO, and MECO employ more than 2,000 people. Approximately 20,000 Hawaii residents are shareholders of HECO’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI).[2] The company is headquartered in Honolulu. The net income of the company reached 164 million dollars by the end of 2012 with a yearly revenue of 3.4 billion dollars.[3]

History[edit]
Hawaiian Electric Company (often abbreviated HECO, pronounced HEE-coh) incorporated on October 13, 1891.[4] Within about 16 years the utility had 2,500 customers on the island of Oahu. By 1914 HECO had started rural service to the windward side of the island and was marketing electric products like refrigerators and flat irons. By 1937 HECO broke ground on its second power plant, and transmission lines soon crisscrossed Oahu.[5]
War and statehood[edit]
During World War II HECO power plants, now linked to busy military bases, generated more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity each day.
Hawaii became a state in 1959, and by then the entire island of Oahu was electrified. Massive power plants, some still in operation today, came online. HECO flipped the switch on a 116 MW plant in downtown Honolulu in 1954. The state's first reheat steam turbine generator went on line at Kahe on the west coast of Oahu. Today, Kahe is the state's largest plant with a total generating capacity of 650 MW.
Island expansion[edit]
HECO purchased Maui Electric Company (abbreviated MECO and pronounced ME-coh) in 1968. In 1970 HECO also acquired the Big Island's Hilo Electric Light Company (later to be renamed Hawaii Electric Light Company, abbreviated HELCO and pronounced HEL-coh). MECO had expansion plans of its own. In 1988, it acquired the Lanai City power plant on the island of Lanai, and in 1989, Molokai Electric Company on the island of Molokai. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.[1] At the moment,[when?] HECO is developing a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki, to ensure a reliable electrical supply.[6]
On December 4, 2014, NextEra Energy tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.[7] On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.[8] The merger included plans to convert HEI's oil-fired generating plants to run on natural gas, which were to use liquified natural gas imported from a British Columbia plant of FortisBC. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.[9]
Generation[edit]
In 2016 HECO produced 8.8 TWh, of which 2.3 TWh were renewable.[10] Most of the power came from oil, using 8.5 million barrels in 2016, down from 10.7 million barrels in 2008.[11]
