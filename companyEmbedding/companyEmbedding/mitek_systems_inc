TRUSS VS. STICK FRAMING FACTS
Switching from costly stick framing to efficient component framing can generate substantial savings.

Calculate Your Savings




Industry Update
Framing the American Dream:
New project proves component framing is more efficient in terms of man hours, materials and waste.
The 2015 Framing the American Dream project built a stick framed home, side by side, with a component framed home, to compare the relative efficiency of the two approaches.
See The Results




 



Bottom line: With trusses, the complexity of our roofing operation is about 10% of what it was when we were stick framing… while saving us labor costs, lowering our risk, lowering our waste and making us a better and more efficient homebuilder.

Great UX

KYC & AML Compliance





Reduce Costs

Mobile Verify®, Mitek's ID verification solution, is used by financial services organizations and leading brands across the globe to create trust in the digital channel for safe onboarding, fast money movement, and user authentication. Digital leaders trust identity verification with Mobile Verify® because of its proven, customer friendly user experience and because it keeps them in compliance with ever increasing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

Only omnichannel identity verification
Creating trust across channels is now a reality.
Mobile Verify® ID verification can be integrated into mobile apps, mobile websites, and desktop applications and to be used by employees for assisted service on tablets.
Mitek MiSnap™, our patented mobile auto capture, is used across all channels.



 


Global ID verification 
Mobile Verify® completes the industry most comprehensive checks. It evaluates the document to determine its authenticity and if it has been altered in any way.
For U.S. driver's licenses, only Mobile Verify® has the ability to find and decode enhanced security features. When this feature is found, a document is 100% authentic. These security features cannot be read by other ID document verification solutions.
Clear actionable results
When a document is authenticated by Mobile Verify®, it is a genuine government-issued identity document. If fraudulent, it is immediately rejected. Documents that are suspicious are returned with warnings indicating that additional checks on the consumer are required.

Keep money moving in compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations
The European Union's AMLD 4.1 states that it is essential to recognize secure electronic copies of original identity documents.
To help fight terrorism and organized crime, AML regulation around money movement are very stringent. Payments processors, money transfer platforms, and P2P payments companies are using Mobile Verify® to satisfy these requirements and customer’s demand for a seamless digital experience.
Download this case study to learn how a global payment processor lifts 92% of AML restrictions placed on users in minutes using ID verification with Mobile Verify®.



 


Facial comparison adds another factor of identity verification
Be sure the person submitting the ID document is who they say they are with facial comparison. Mitek's Mobile Verify Facial Comparison SDK uses advanced liveness detection so it cannot be spoofed. The user simply takes a selfie and the photo is compared to the photo on the ID document.



 


Instant ID verification clears your pended queue
You know there are good customers in your pended queue. They may be Millennials, immigrants or others with a thin credit file who simply cannot be identified with traditional checks. Asking them to leave the mobile channel and take their ID document to a physical location or fax in a copy isn’t the answer. Those trying to validate identity this way are seeing abandonment rates as high as 90%.
Mobile Verify® is your key to getting good customers out of the pended queue, onboarded and generating lifetime value.

TRUSS VS. STICK FRAMING FACTS
Switching from costly stick framing to efficient component framing can generate substantial savings.

Calculate Your Savings




Industry Update
Framing the American Dream:
New project proves component framing is more efficient in terms of man hours, materials and waste.
The 2015 Framing the American Dream project built a stick framed home, side by side, with a component framed home, to compare the relative efficiency of the two approaches.
See The Results




 



Bottom line: With trusses, the complexity of our roofing operation is about 10% of what it was when we were stick framing… while saving us labor costs, lowering our risk, lowering our waste and making us a better and more efficient homebuilder.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
