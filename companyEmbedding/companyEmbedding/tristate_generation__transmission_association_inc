Cimarron Solar energizes first 10 megawatts
 
 
 
The first of two major renewable  energy projects that will produce solar and wind energy for purchase by  Tri-State to deliver to its 44 member cooperatives reached a significant  milestone on Oct. 13, when Cimarron Solar Facility’s first module of 10  megawatts officially began commercial operation.   The  30-megawatt photovoltaic facility is currently under construction in  northeastern New Mexico.  
 
The 250-acre plant site, which is  located within the service territory of Tri-State member system Springer  Electric Cooperative, is scheduled to be brought into commercial service in 10  megawatt blocks.  "Right now we’re  anticipating that the second 10 megawatts at Cimarron will begin commercial  operation by the end of October and the final block of 10 megawatts will go  into service by mid-November," said Scott Fernau, Tri-State’s senior transmission  project manager.  
 
The 51-megawatt Kit Carson Windpower Project  is also nearing its startup phase as Tri-State’s project field support,  telecommunications, metering and SCADA personnel work through the final phases  of equipment testing at the Landsman Creek Substation, which will serve this  eastern Colorado wind farm that is owned and operated by Duke Energy Generation  Services. 
 
"Once the work is finalized next month  at the substation we will be able to start back feeding power to the Duke  Energy wind site so that their construction crews can complete their testing  and commissioning of the project’s 34 turbines for a commercial startup by Dec.  1," said Fernau.
 
The Kit Carson Windpower Project is  located on a 6,000 acre site approximately seven miles northwest of Burlington,  Colo.  It is located within the service  territory of Tri-State member K.C. Electric Association, based in Hugo, Colo.

Tri-State stays on the cutting edge   of technology breakthroughs by investing in research and development aimed at   tackling a number of important energy and environmental issues – and it has been   recognized by the electric industry for its commitment to these   initiatives.
 
Energy innovation isn’t just about   finding new sources of power; it’s about exploring new ways of producing and   delivering it.  Tri-State is using both products and services as well as technology to lessen emissions to meet growing demand with less   environmental impact.
 
Combining new and traditional energy   resources, while exploring new methods of carbon capture and utilization to   reduce greenhouse gas emissions, results in cleaner production, which equals   cleaner air.
 
Tri-State and other electric   utilities look to research and development (R&D) and advanced technology to help meet the   challenges of providing reliable service while following increasingly complex   and stringent regulatory guidelines and regulations.  These ventures can be   risky, costly and time consuming, so electric utilities often pool their resources to   make the most of this vital aspect of the industry. 
 
Tri-State is involved with many   R&D projects on two levels: core research and demonstration projects.  Core   research is pooled by way of funding from members of a consortium and is of a general nature   so it can benefit the majority.  Demonstration projects are of interest to only   select utility members and the results usually study a specific issue for only a   small number of funders.
 
Tri-State and its member   systems participate in several collaborative research   groups:
 
 
 

 Electric Power Research Institute is a worldwide consortium of nearly 1,000 utilities whose collaborative science and technology portfolio spans every aspect of power generation, delivery and end-use applications.
 
 Cooperative Research Network provides electric cooperatives with the technical information and business tools that  lead to the development of new products and services of particular value to the cooperative industry.
 
 Power System Engineering Research Center is a network of universities working with industry to find innovative solutions to challenges facing  electric utilities and to educate the next generation of power industry engineers.

 
 Utility Variable Generation Integration Group provides a forum for the critical analysis of wind technology for utility applications and to serve as a source of credible information on the status of wind technology and deployment.
 
 Solar Electric Interest Group provides a forum for  participants to exchange information on all solar electric  technologies, applications and market developments.
