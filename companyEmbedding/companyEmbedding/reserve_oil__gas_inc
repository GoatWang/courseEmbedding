Our History


 Today, Our Roots Are Over 45 Years Strong In West Virginia

 
David A. Freshwater, president, went to work in 1968 in the Walton Oilfield Boom, and purchased his first cable tool rig in 1970, providing oilfield services to the oil and gas industry.  David was later provided the opportunity to be mentored by the late Richard L. Mann in rotary drilling operations, and in business by the late Reeves Lewenthal, a U.S. art pioneer turned oil and gas developer.  The three became successful partners for two decades in oil and gas development.
Today, with his son, Jacob Scott Freshwater, Vice President, and with their affiliate, Reserve Oil & Gas, Inc. has drilled and completed 180 shale wells utilizing our own drilling rig, and hold approximately 50,000 acres in the Appalachian Basin with a 135 mile non-regulated pipeline to multiple outlets, and also owns non-operating well interests in other companies in the Appalachian Basin.  Today, the company’s cost-cutting culture and experience enables the company to operate in rough times, and is prepared to build on its reputation and through the responsible development of their Appalachian Basin oil and gas properties.
