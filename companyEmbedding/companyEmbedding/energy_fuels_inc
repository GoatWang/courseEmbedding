Energy Fuels - High Production Increase Potential If Uranium Prices Rally - Energy Fuels Inc (NYSEMKT:UUUU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Energy Fuels - High Production Increase Potential If Uranium Prices RallyMar.30.17 | About: Energy Fuels (UUUU) Zoltan Ban Commodities, macro, gold & precious metals, long/short equitySummaryFebruary was the third consecutive month of uranium price gains since November bottom. Not certain yet whether November was the actual bottom, but we are most likely close based on data.Energy Fuels has the potential to increase production by a large factor if uranium prices increase significantly.Profitability is a bit of an issue.As I pointed out in an article, I wrote a few months back, I believe that we are either close to reaching a bottom in uranium prices or we might have even reached that point back in November 2016. 

 Source: Index Mundi I recognize the fact that the decade-long decline trend in uranium prices has seen similar short-term reversals on numerous occasions, only to once more reverse course and head down again. As I pointed out already in a previous article earlier in the month, where I announced that I started taking up a position in uranium, starting with Ur-Energy (NYSEMKT:URG), there seems to be a definite and sustained gap opening up between supply and demand, which makes it imperative to start looking at uranium miners in my view. For this article, I decided to analyze Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEMKT:UUUU). 

 Source: Mining.com As far as I can tell, it seems that the odds of uranium having bottomed in November 2016 or bottoming this year or next at the latest are very good. I think there is an increasingly strong chance that the bottom was reached in November, but even if not, I do not see uranium prices going far below that level for very long. We should keep in mind that uranium fuel consumers are also looking at charts like the one above and will therefore consider the current price environment more desirable for them compared with five or ten years from now. It therefore makes sense to keep buying today, or even increase purchases, making it unlikely that we will revisit the November bottom.
 A number of recent factors, such as Russia scrapping its weapons grade decommissioning agreement, Kazakhstan deciding to cut mined production by 10%, and Japan deciding to restart nuclear reactors are still in place. In fact, a court ruling announced just this week gave the green light for two reactors to come on line. This means that the expected sale of existing nuclear fuel stockpiles in Japan may not be sold off after all. In fact, even the whole Germany completely scrapping its nuclear power capacity story may in the end turn out to be long-term misguided expectations. As I pointed out in an article a few months back, Germany is starting to come to terms with the fact that it cannot simply cut its nuclear, coal and natural gas power generation out of environmental convictions and replace it all with wind and solar. It recently took steps to cut support for these renewable sources. One source of concern is the fact that power generation capacity from these sources literally varies based on weather patterns. On some days, wind & solar may provide close to 100% of Germany's electricity needs, while on other days it may drop into single-digit territory. Replacing nuclear capacity with natural gas may not be desirable or viable either, because gas production from the Netherlands, which in 2012 accounted for about half of all EU domestic supply is collapsing, while the alternative is to drastically increase imports from Russia. There is a new massive pipeline project in the works from Russia to Germany, but it is likely to be a way to cut reliance on Ukraine as a transit route and to make up for lost Dutch production, rather than supply the needed gas for the replacement of nuclear power in Germany. I personally believe that there will be some significant political push to delay or even reverse the decision to scrap all the nuclear reactors soon after this year's federal elections, because things simply don't add up. Ur-Energy is not the only stock I want to own in order to position for what I believe to be an emerging long-term investment opportunity. I already covered Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), Denison (NYSEMKT:DNN) and Uranium Resources Inc (NASDAQ:URRE). I will most likely continue buying this year and next as part of a strategy to build up exposure to uranium in coming years. I want to continue looking at the field of possible investment targets by analyzing Energy Fuels Inc., which offers its own unique qualities as a potential investment target for those who want to have longer-term uranium mining exposure.
 The main thing we need to look at in regards to Energy Fuels is its profitability, reserves, and valuation. In terms of profitability, it recorded a loss of $39.4 million, on revenue of $54.6 million. This company clearly needs a significantly higher realized uranium price if it is to break even. 

 Source: Energy Fuels As we can see, revenue declined compared with the previous three years, but so did the size of the financial loss. In 2016, it produced over a million pounds of Uranium and it sold a total of 1.15 million pounds. For 2017, it intends to sell 520,000 pounds, unless prices increase, or if need be raise some cash by selling on the spot market. According to its latest presentation, however, it has licensing to produce as much as over 8 million pounds per year. The maximum production ever reached was 4.5 million pound per year. It is unclear how much Energy Fuels could or would produce at certain price thresholds, but it can clearly increase production dramatically from this year's projected levels. As far as the reserve base it can produce from, it is looking relatively good. 

 Source: Energy Fuels Inc Taking proven, measured and half of indicated resources together, we get 56.5 million pounds. At this year's production rate, the reserve base would be sufficient for over 100 years. We cannot expect production to remain at current levels, however, so a more realistic estimate would be about 25-50 years, depending on future production choices.
 In terms of company valuation, the company currently trades at a market cap of just over 200 million Canadian dollars, or about $150 million. Assuming an average realized price of $50/pound for its resources, the future value of the uranium that is very likely to be extracted is about $2.8 billion. Subtracting the liabilities of $47 million, and then adding $24 million in cash, we get $2.75 billion. Based on the costs applicable to revenue data from the K-10, we can assume that the cost of producing a pound of uranium was $31 in 2016. This is based on the sale of 1.15 million pounds of uranium and costs of revenue of $35 million, meaning that it would take about $1.7 billion to produce the reserves currently assumed to be recoverable. Subtracting the $1.7 billion from the $2.75 billion value of the reserves, we get a net value of $1.05 billion, versus a market cap of about $150 million. A fair value of .143 is therefore what we are looking at, meaning that this stock could be worth a potential market cap of about $1 billion by this measure. This trading discount to the fair value based on its resources should not be seen as being unexpected, because it would take this company moving towards profit at much higher revenue levels in order to start rising towards that market cap level. As far as odds of reaching profitability, comparing it with Ur-Energy which I recently bought, it is looking like the road to profitability will be much longer. Ur-Energy recorded a loss of $3 million on revenue of $27 million. In other words, the loss was about 11% of revenue, while Energy Fuels recorded a loss of $39.4 million on revenue of $54.6 million, meaning that the size of the loss was 72% of revenue. Two advantages I see for Energy Fuels is the fact that interest costs were 4.2% of revenue, compared with 7% for Ur-Energy. As I pointed out on many previous occasions, this is a measure I regard to be very important when analyzing resource extraction companies. I generally do not like to see an interest/revenue ratio higher than 10%. The other advantage is the sheer size of the resource base, as well as the higher potential production capacity. In this regard, I do believe that if we were to see a very sharp increase in realized uranium prices, Energy Fuels could during that price spike period outperform Ur-Energy in terms of stock gains. I do not believe that a sharp price spike in uranium is likely to happen any time, however. I think the gain in prices will be more of a healthy, steady, and moderate, but sustainable variety. Energy Fuels will most likely do well if the uranium market rebounds as I expect it will for the long term. It will just take a long time to get to profitable uranium miner status, which is an obvious downside compared with some peers.

Corporate






 





Energy Fuels is a leading, US-based, integrated producer of uranium – the fuel for carbon-free, emission-free nuclear energy.
Our uranium production portfolio is unique in the World today.  Nuclear energy is expected to see strong growth in the coming years, as nations around the World work to provide plentiful and affordable energy, while combating global climate change and air pollution.  We utilize both conventional and in-situ recovery (“ISR”) technology and produce uranium from two strategic facilities – the White Mesa Mill in Utah (conventional) and the Nichols Ranch Plant in Wyoming (ISR). Our portfolio also boasts a book of premium-priced sales contracts with major nuclear utilities, an industry-leading U.S.-based NI 43-101 Mineral Resource portfolio among producers, and a pipeline of high-quality, large-scale development and exploration projects. As uranium prices increase, Energy Fuels has the resources and processing capacity to significantly increase uranium production in the U.S.
 
 
 
 



Beyond Uranium
Energy Fuels is also a potential producer of vanadium, as a co-product along with uranium at some of its mines. We have significant high-grade vanadium resources, along with a separate, high-purity vanadium production circuit at the White Mesa Mill.  There is a growing potential to use vanadium in the next generation of advanced battery technologies.  Energy Fuels is poised to capitalize on this potential opportunity.

Our Uranium Mining Operations
 

Conventional Production

Energy Fuels is the only conventional uranium mining producer in America. At Energy Fuels, we take great pride in owning and operating the highly strategic White Mesa conventional uranium mill, which is the only fully-licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the U.S.  With a licensed capacity of 8 million pounds of uranium per year, Energy Fuels boasts enormous production scalability from this facility as uranium prices rise in the coming years.  Our conventional assets also include some of the largest and highest-grade uranium mines and projects in the United States, including the Canyon mine and the Roca Honda, Sheep Mountain and Henry Mountains projects.  To learn more about Energy Fuels’ conventional production, click here.
 
 
 
In-Situ Production

Energy Fuels owns and operates two ISR production facilities in the U.S.: the Nichols Ranch ISR plant and mine, located in Wyoming’s productive Powder River Basin, and the Alta Mesa ISR plant and mine, located in south Texas. In-situ recovery, or “ISR”, is an attractive method of producing uranium that is cost effective and protective of the environment. Nichols Ranch has a capacity of 2 million pounds of uranium per year and Alta Mesa has a capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year, providing Energy Fuels room to grow through nearby licensed and advanced-stage permitting projects. In addition, we control large land positions at both locations with exciting exploration potential. To learn more about Energy Fuels’ current in situ production at Nichols Ranch and future production potential at the Alta Mesa, Hank and Jane Dough projects, click here.
 
 
 
Large-Scale Production Scalability

While Energy Fuels is currently a major producer of uranium, our primary goal is to become the dominant producer of U.S. uranium in the World. Our White Mesa conventional uranium mining mill has a licensed capacity of 8 million pounds of uranium per year, and our Nichols Ranch ISR plant has a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds per year.  Energy Fuels also has three large-scale conventional projects now in permitting – Roca Honda, Sheep Mountain and Henry Mountains – with 20 to over 30 million pounds of uranium resources and annual production profiles of between 1 and 2.7 million pounds of uranium – each.  Finally, Energy Fuels boasts the largest NI 43-101 compliant uranium resource base in the U.S., among producers and near-producers.  These production facilities and resources provide Energy Fuels with the tools we need to accomplish our goal and become a major uranium producer on a global scale.  To learn more click here.

Energy Fuels – America’s Premier Uranium Producer



Overview
Energy Fuels Inc. (TSX:EFR,NYSEMKT:UUUU) is a leading US-based uranium producer.  In 2016, Energy Fuels was the second largest supplier of uranium within the United States, and according to published company guidance, Energy Fuels is expected to become the #1 uranium producer in the United States in 2017.  Energy Fuels also holds the largest in-ground uranium resource portfolio of any producer or near-producer in the United States. The United States, the world’s leading producer of nuclear energy and uranium consumer, currently obtains about 94 percent of its annual uranium requirements from foreign sources. The nation is home to 99 commercial nuclear reactors with four more under construction.
Energy Fuels is the only uranium producer with both conventional production and in situ uranium recovery (“ISR”) in the United States. With the only conventional uranium mill operating in the country and a large portfolio of high-quality conventional and ISR uranium properties, Energy Fuels is the leading uranium mining company in the U.S., in terms of current production, scalability, and resource portfolio. Energy Fuels offers excellent leverage to rising uranium prices and is well- positioned to capitalize on the growing need for more domestic and global uranium supplies.
Energy Fuels’ response to lower prices has been to consolidate the U.S. uranium space, acquiring a 100 percent stake in high-value assets while liquidating. The company also continues to permit and develop its quality portfolio of low-cost producing and near-producing uranium projects. As uranium prices rise, Energy Fuels plans to swiftly scale up production at its low-cost projects, including its currently-producing Nichols Ranch ISR Project in Wyoming, its fully-permitted and constructed Alta Mesa ISR Project in Texas, its fully-permitted and nearly developed Canyon Mine in Arizona, and Canyon Mine ore and alternate feed materials at its White Mesa Mill in Utah.  The Company also expects to earn additional revenues through toll processing, production of other valuable minerals (including vanadium and copper), and other business opportunities at its White Mesa Mill.  Longer-term, the Company expects to produce uranium from large-scale conventional projects including the fully-permitted Sheep Mountain Project (, Wyoming), the advanced-stage ; and Roca Honda Project (, New Mexico), and the Bullfrog Project (Utah).  The Company also has the potential to produce copper from its Canyon Mine in Arizona and vanadium from several of its mines currently on standby in Utah and Colorado.
In a March 2017 letter to shareholders, Energy Fuels President and CEO Stephen Antony stated, “While I can’t say whether the recent upward price move in uranium is the beginning of the ‘next uranium bull market’, I confidently believe there is considerable upside for proven producers of uranium with scalability and high-quality assets like Energy Fuels.”
 
Investment Highlights

Currently reducing production in the current low-price environment, in order to conserve cash and valuable in-ground resources, thereby increasing leverage to improving uranium prices.
The White Mesa Mill: The only conventional uranium mill operating in the United States (over 8 million pounds of annual capacity), located in Utah.
The Nichols Ranch ISR Project: Existing ISR production in Wyoming, licensed to significantly increase output (2 million pounds of annual capacity).
The Alta Mesa ISR Project: Significant existing ISR production on standby in Texas (1.5 million pounds of annual capacity)..
Production of 1,015,000 pounds in 2016 with an expected 800675,000 pounds of U3O8   in 2017.
Current & Near-Term U3O8 Production: Nichols Ranch, Alta Mesa, Canyon Mine, Alternate Feed Materials at the White Mesa Mill.
Significant Future Scalability: three Three large-scale uranium projects with over 50 million pounds of combined measured and indicated resources at the Sheep Mountain Project (fully-permitted), the Roca Honda Project (advanced-stage permitting), and the Bullfrog Project (pre-permitting stage).
Other Conventional Mines on Standby that Can Resume Production in Improving Markets:  the La Sal Complex, the Daneros Mine, the Whirlwind Mine, and the Tony M Mine.

 
 Ongoing Conventional Uranium Production: The White Mesa Mill

Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill is truly a strategic asset, as it provides the Company with a multitude of business opportunities, including the production of uranium.  The facility is the only fully-licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the United States, and one of only three in North America. White Mesa is strategically located in Blanding, Utah, central to the highest-grade uranium mines in the United States. Since 2010, the mill has produced about six million pounds of uranium, and it is expected to produce 375,000 pounds in 2017, as the Company cuts production in response to recent low prices. It is also capable of producing a high-purity vanadium product, and the Company is evaluating the potential to recover copper.  Finally, it is also ideally positioned to generate revenue through 3rd party toll milling, processing low-cost alternate feed materials, and participating in the cleanup of historic uranium mines in the region.
Although, the White Mesa Mill will only produce about 375,000 lbs. in 2017, it has a licensed capacity of over 8 million lbs. of U3O8  per year..
Ongoing In Situ Uranium Production: The Nichols Ranch ISR Project
Energy Fuels owns and operates the Nichols Ranch ISR Project, located in the prolific Powder River Basin of Wyoming.  Energy Fuels acquired this key production asset in 2015, through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation. In 2016, the Company produced about 300,000 pounds of uranium at Nichols Ranch, and in 2017, the Company expects to produce about 3050,000 pounds of U3O8. The Company currently has 9 wellfields in operation, with an additional 34 wellfields permitted for production as market conditions warrant, ensuring a long-term production profile. While today’s prices dictate reduced levels of production, tThe facility has a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds of uranium per year. 
 

In Situ Uranium Production on Standby: Alta Mesa ISR Project
In June 2016, Energy Fuels completed the acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, and its flagship Alta Mesa ISR project, located in South Texas. Alta Mesa is a well-known, proven low-cost uranium producer within the U.  S. nuclear industry. Between 2005 and 2013, the facility produced about 4.6 million pounds of uranium, including over 1 million pounds in two of those years. The project is currently on care and maintenance. As uranium prices rise above about the $40 per pound level on a sustained basis, Energy Fuels expects to resume production at this important asset.
According to an August 2016 NI 43-101 Technical Report, Alta Mesa contains an estimated 1.6 million tons of measured and indicated mineral resources with an average grade of 0.11 percent containing 3.6 million lbs. of uranium, plus 7.0 million tons of inferred mineral resources with an average grade of 0.12 percent containing 16.8 million pounds of uranium. In addition, the technical report identified further areas for exploration, with an average grade of 0.08 to 0.123 percent U3O8 containing 4.1 to 6.6 million pounds of uranium.  The total project area is over 200,000 acres providing the Company with a long-term, low-cost uranium production profile from this asset. 
The Nichols Ranch ISR project in Wyoming, the Alta Mesa ISR Project in Texas, and the White Mesa Mill in Utah gives Energy Fuels diversified, low-cost ISR and conventional uranium production from three production centers. The Company has four uranium sales contracts extending to 2020, with over a half million pounds of U3O8 under contract in 2017.  Energy Fuels expects to deliver 520,000 pounds of uranium in the fiscal-year 2017 under its existing contracts. Three of those contracts are at a significant premium to current spot prices. A fourth will be priced based on the average spot price per pound of uranium five weeks prior to the delivery date. 
Acquiring Nichols Ranch and Alta Mesa deepened the value of Energy Fuels’ already impressive development pipeline which includes the largest NI 43-101 resource base among producers in the United States. These ISR acquisitions make the company the only integrated mining company with conventional and ISR uranium production in the United States.
“Energy Fuels is clearly emerging as a leading integrated producer of uranium in the United States.  We now have low-cost ISR and conventional uranium production in our portfolio, the largest NI 43-101 compliant in-ground uranium resource in the U.S. among producers, and the ability to significantly increase uranium production in the future as uranium prices rise,” explained Antony.
Canyon Mine: In Development
Canyon Mine: Fully-Permitted Mine In Development
Energy Fuels towns the fully-permitted Canyon mine in northern Arizona.  This is a very high-grade breccia pipe uranium mine within trucking distance of the Company’s White Mesa Mill, where the ore will be processed in the future.  The Company believes this project has costs in-line with the lowest cost, “tier one” conventional uranium mines operating in the World today.
The breccia deposits of northern Arizona contain the highest grades of uranium found in the United States, and are among the highest grades in the world outside Canada’s Athabasca Basin.
Existing surface development at Canyon includes a headframe, evaporation pond, hoist, maintenance facility and environmental controls. In early 2017, Energy Fuels stated it had built all surface developments and completed its 1,470-foot production shaft. The company also completed underground drilling to define and expand the deposit.  
According to a 2012 technical report, inferred mineral resources at the Canyon mine are estimated to include 1,629,000 pounds of U3O8 grading 0.98 percent U3O8  contained in 83,000 tons. However, the Company believes the current underground drilling program will significantly expand and upgrade the in-place uranium resources at this low-cost project.   Chemical assay results disclosed to date have identified large zones of previously undiscovered high-grade uranium mineralization, expected to be more substantial than estimated in the original 2012 report, including 6-feet of mineralization averaging 17% U3O8 and 46-feet of mineralization averaging 1.37% U3O8.. In addition, chemical assays are confirmed potentially lucrative high-grade copper mineralization including 645-feet averaging about 10% Cu. The company plans to release another technical report in 2017 that will reflect the new findings.
Scalable Production
In addition to the aforementioned projects, Energy Fuels has successfully amassed a diverse portfolio of additional production-ready and late-development stage uranium properties giving the company significant future production scalability.
Roca Honda — New Mexico
The Roca Honda project was acquired by Energy Fuels as part of its acquisition of Strathmore Minerals in 2013. The project is located in northwest New Mexico within trucking distance of Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill.
Roca Honda is one of the largest and highest grade development-stage uranium projects in the United States. The 2015 NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (‘PEA’) and Technical Report on the project shows 1.51 million tons of measured and indicated resources with an average grade of 0.48 percent U3O8 containing 14.56 million pounds of U3O8  as well as an additional 1.20 million tons of inferred mineral resources with an average grade of 0.47 percent U3O8 containing 11.21 million pounds of U3O8. A December 2016 PEA revised cost of production to US$33.27 a pound, approximately two dollars less than initially estimated (US$35). Capital costs comprised of upfront capital and operating capital, mine closure and reclamation are expected to total US$13.88 per pound of uranium.  The PEA further anticipates average production of 2.7 million pounds of uranium per year over a mine-life of 9-years.
Roca Honda areas in red; areas with hatch marks are what Energy Fuels is acquiring and the unhatched red areas are existing projects
On August 3, 2015, Energy Fuels announced that it had completed the acquisition of a highly strategic 4,580-acre land position adjacent to its existing Roca Honda holdings. This is a major step in consolidating the properties adjacent to General Atomics’ Mountain Taylor uranium mine. The properties acquired include significant historical resources and a historic mine shaft constructed in the early 1980’s by Kerr-McGee to within 200 feet of the ore body. The acquired properties have the potential to significantly enhance the project economics of Roca Honda.
In May 2016, Energy Fuels announced acquiring a 100 percent interest in the Roca Honda project. As a result of the buyout, Energy Fuels has increased its portfolio size by 6.8 percent measured and  indicated, and 12.4 percent inferred resources. Roca Honda is currently in an advanced stage of permitting which is expected to be completed in 2017.
Sheep Mountain — Wyoming
The Sheep Mountain project is a fully-permitted conventional uranium mine located approximately eight miles south of Jeffrey City, Wyoming on a land package totaling 4,475 acres. The project includes the Congo Pit, a proposed open pit development, and the existing Sheep Mountain Underground mine. The Sheep Mountain mine is a formerly producing conventional uranium mine with potential to become a long-term uranium production center at higher uranium prices. The project has a Resource Estimate of approximately 12.9 million tons of measured and indicated resources at an average grade of 0.12 percent U3O8 (30.3 million lbs. U3O8), including 18.4 million pounds of Reserves. 
Energy Fuels receiving its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) for the Sheep Mountain project In January 2017. This was last major government approval required to begin mining at this site.
Energy Fuels plans to redevelop Sheep Mountain using both conventional underground and open pit mining methods with uranium produced in a new heap leach extraction process. The company’s current plans specify a mine life of 15 years, comprising 11 years of open pit operation and an additional 5 years allotted for mine closure and reclamation. The PFS estimates the Sheep Mountain project can produce up to 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year over its 15-year lifespan. 
Henry Mountains — Utah
The Henry Mountains complex is a contiguous group of uranium properties which includes the Tony M/Southwest deposit, the Copper Bench/Indian Bench deposit, and the Tony M mine. The 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Complex shows approximately 2.5 million tons of indicated resources with an average grade of 0.27 percent U3O8  (12.8 million pounds U3O8) and approximately 1.61 million tons of Inferred resources with an average grade of 0.25 percent U3O8 (8.08 million pounds U3O8).
The fully-permitted and developed Tony M portion of the Henry Mountains Complex is currently on standby. The high-grade Bullfrog deposit is currently in preparation for permitting. This project, which the Company estimates could produce up to 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year, is in close proximity to the company’s White Mesa Mill – less than 100 miles trucking distance.
La Sal— Utah
The fully-permitted and developed La Sal Complex) of mines was in production as recently as late 2012. The project remains on standby as of early 2017. The La Sal Complex includes four uranium/vanadium mines (La Sal, Beaver, Energy Queen and Pandora) connected by an extensive network of underground workings. The complex is located in the La Sal Mining District along the La Sal Trend which runs east/west for about 20 miles. Ore is processed at the company’s nearby White Mesa Mill.
Daneros — Utah
The fully-permitted and developed Daneros mine was in production as recently as October 2012, at which point it was placed on standby. It remains on standby as of early 2017. The Daneros mine is located in Utah’s White Canyon Mining District from which historic production totaled more than 11 million pounds of U3O8. Daneros contains approximately 156,600 tons of inferred resources with an average grade of 0.21 percent containing 661,000 pounds of U3O8 (December 31, 2013). Ore is processed at the company’s nearby White Mesa Mill.
Wate – Arizona
The Wate project is a nearly-permitted high-grade breccia pipe deposit located in Northern Arizona. Energy Fuels now holds a 100-percent interest in the Wate following an acquisition transaction completed in November 2015.
According to a 2015 Technical Report, the Wate project contains approximately 1.12 million pounds of uranium contained in approximately 70,000 tons of inferred mineral resources with an average grade of 0.79 percent U3O8.
The Wate project, which sits on Arizona State Land, is in an advanced stage of permitting. A mineral lease (which includes a mining permit) is expected to be issued later in 2017. Once the mineral lease is granted, Energy Fuels expects to move forward to acquire the additional environmental permits and other approvals required to commence development and mining.

      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(7/10/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. continues to advance its pipeline of assets while maintaining production optionality. . .we think that significant near-term, low-cost production remains available for the company should prices begin to recover. . .remaining 2017 production is expected to improve over Q1/17 levels."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(6/1/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is in good financial position to weather the current storm in the uranium market. As of its most recent quarter, the company had $23.8M in working capital and cash and cash equivalents of $12.2M; and that's before it generated another $13M in early April from the sale of 200 Klb uranium at long-term contract prices."

		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(5/10/17)

		
		"While uranium prices are low, Energy Fuels Inc. is pushing to find additional opportunities from toll milling, alternate feed, pond returns and potential copper production. . .alternate feed material, specifically material from hundreds of clean-up sites, is being sought. . .alternate feed rose from 16% to 32% in Q1/17."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(5/9/17)

		
		"Activities at Energy Fuels Inc.'s pipeline projects, such as Jane Dough (now fully licensed and permitted) and Canyon (completed shaft sinking and positive drill results), along with a strong current working capital position re-enforce our view that the company remains a top leverage play to the upcoming uranium recovery. We reiterate our Buy recommendation."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(5/9/17)

		
		"We raised our full-year revenue and EPS estimates on Energy Fuels Inc. Additionally, we continue to believe the company is positioned for significant revenue growth once the uranium market recovers; thus, we are maintaining our Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(5/8/17)

		
		"Over the course of 2017, Energy Fuels Inc. will be earning a fee for processing approximately 1 Mlb U3O8 contained in alternate feed materials; this recovery process began in Q1/17 with the completion of 39 Klb processed material. The contract is expected to result in $6.5M in revenues for the year."
		
		
















DOE Uranium Reduction Should Help Boost Market
				(5/2/17)

			    		Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry issued a determination that reduces the amount of uranium the department can transfer in 2017 and 2018; the reduction should give a boost to uranium producers.

As Uranium Price Turns, Insiders Stock Up on Energy Fuels
				(3/23/17)

			    		Analysts watching the uranium market agree that as prices for U3O8 turn around, Energy Fuels' U.S.-based assets, including its conventional and in-situ recovery operations at the Canyon Mine and Nichols Ranch, respectively, make it a good bet for investors. The company's management team and directors must agree because they have upped their share ownership.

		"Energy Fuels Inc. plans to reduce production in 2017 while maintaining its focus on prepping its Canyon Mine for eventual production. The company's share price has held on to the gains it made in the aftermath of the Trump election, but it continues to trade at attractive levels for long-term accumulation."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(3/23/17)

		
		"Federal approval for both Energy Fuels Inc.'s Jane Dough well field (the Environmental Protection Agency's aquifer exemption) and an amended license to connect Jane Dough to the Nichols Ranch plant (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's source material license) are now complete. . .this eliminates permitting-related derisking of its Wyoming in situ recovery (ISR) pipeline for several years and helps low cost ISR production to displace higher cost conventional."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(3/23/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has announced that it has received the final amendment to the source material license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowing for the expansion of the Nichols Ranch in situ recovery project. . .the expansion into Jane Dough allows for future long run production or upside optionality. Note that the total licensed capacity at the Nichols Ranch plant is for 2 Mlb/year."
		
		












  
      Eric Coffin, Hard Rock Analyst
(3/19/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. exited 2016 with working capital of $24M including $16.9M in cash and equivalents. . .for 2017, the company estimates uranium production of 350 Klb from its in situ recovery production at Nichols Ranch and 550 Klb from the White Mesa mill from conventional milling, tailings reprocessing and treatment of third party material."
		
		









  Rob Chang, Uranium Investing News 

(3/16/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is one of our favorite names. It's the best leveraged to the uranium price, in our opinion, the reason being is that it has the capability to produce anywhere between 3 and maybe 7 Mlb, depending on what the uranium price is. . .the company has many assets on standby that can turn on so when the prices go up, it will be in a good position to capitalize."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(3/10/17)

		
		"We believe Energy Fuels Inc. will benefit from industry production cuts and a rising uranium price. . .we believe the Canyon mine could provide significant catalysts for the company throughout 2017. We anticipate Energy Fuels will release an updated technical report on the resource estimate at the project in the middle of this year."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(3/10/17)

		
		"We continue to view Energy Fuels Inc. as our top leverage play to the upcoming uranium recovery. . .during 2016, sales of 1.15 Mlb U3O8 were completed by the company. . .recoveries amounted to 680 Klb U3O8 from White Mesa primarily from alternate feed material along with 335 Klb from Nichols Ranch."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(3/1/17)

		
		"With the 1,470 ft shaft at Energy Fuels Inc.'s Canyon nearing completion, the company has been conducting underground drilling along the way. Highlights include hole 11 (6 ft of 16.99% U3O8 and 1.2% copper), hole 7 (46 ft of 1.37% U3O8 and 13.52% copper) and hole 14 (4 ft of 8.35% U3O8 and 1.64% copper); these assays bode well for Canyon's ability to provide high-grade ore to Energy Fuels' White Mesa mill."
		
		












  
      Eric Coffin, Hard Rock Analyst
(2/22/17)

		
		"Management announced Energy Fuels Inc. received its aquifer license for the Jane Dough well field at its Nichols Ranch in situ recovery project. . .the company also reported new assay results for additional drill holes at its Canyon project where resource definition of this high-grade breccia pipe continues. . .like the permit news above, this is further evidence that Energy Fuels is well positioned for a renewed uranium bull market."
		
		












  
      Colin Healey, Haywood Securities
  

(2/17/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc.'s receipt of Environmental Protection Agency concurrence on the aquifer exemption for the Jane Dough resource area represents positive incremental progress and derisking of the company's Wyoming in situ recovery uranium production pipeline. . .Energy Fuels continues to effectively navigate the complex permitting process related to uranium mining in the U.S."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(2/17/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has received Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval for its Jane Dough well field. . .while expected, the approvals from the EPA and the Wyoming Department of Environmental Equality are necessary milestones in the development of Jane Dough. We continue to view the company as our top leverage play to the uranium recovery."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(2/3/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. announced promising drilling results from its Canyon Project. . .we note that drilling at Canyon continues to return not only high-grade uranium intercepts, but also meaningful amounts of copper, which we find particularly intriguing. While we had initially envisioned Canyon as an eventual high-grade uranium mine, we remain impressed by the continued strong copper grades encountered at the site. . .Energy Fuels is a strategic U.S. uranium producer that is poised to take advantage of future U3O8 price improvements."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(2/2/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. provided an update on the underground drill program at its Canyon Mine located in Northern Arizona. . .the company continues to discover large and high grade areas of uranium mineralization which will add to the current recoverable resource as described in the most recent NI43-101 Technical Report. Moreover, the company continues to discover new zones of high grade copper mineralization throughout the deposit."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(2/1/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. released revised project economics for its Roca Honda uranium project. . .while current uranium prices won't support a mine at Roca Honda, the company has the ability to make a fairly quick decision to greenlight the project, should price conditions improve. . .Roca Honda, the conventional uranium mine, is ready for production."
		
		









  Smallcap Power 

(1/13/17)

		
		"With more than 60 nuclear reactors to open in the near term, and another 140 planned for construction globally, we have identified three TSX uranium stocks that have the greatest leverage to a rising uranium price. . .Energy Fuels Inc. is engaged in conventional and in-situ (ISR) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States."
		
		












  
      Colin Healey, Haywood Securities
  

(1/10/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels  has announced the receipt of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for its 100%-owned Sheep Mountain conventional uranium project. . .the final EIS and ROD represent the final major approvals required ahead of mining at Sheep Mountain. . .the regulatory approvals represent de-risking events for the Sheep Mountain project and are only positive. . .Future color on the potential approach to exploitation, could see us adding Sheep Mountain to our production profile at some point."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(1/10/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. announced that the BLM issued a final EIS and ROD on the company's Sheep Mountain project in Wyoming. Although Energy Fuels Inc. now has all the necessary permits to develop the project, we believe the company will look for a sustained higher price uranium environment before developing the Sheep Mountain project. . .we note that the company clearly views the project as a long-term option, in our opinion. . .we have made no changes to our valuation of EFR and we are maintaining our Buy rating and $2.75 target." 
		
		












  
      Eric Coffin, Hard Rock Analyst
(1/8/17)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has staged a huge comeback in the past three weeks. . .the company did release more results from its ongoing drill campaign at its Canyon mine. . .the results generally exceeded expectations in terms of thickness and grade. Energy Fuels management expects the resource at Canyon will be both larger and higher grade than historic estimates."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(12/27/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is conducting an underground core and percussion drill program to further evaluate the high-grade ore centers at Canyon. . .this effort led in late October to the discovery of uber-high copper grades on the deposit's second level. The copper intersections from this effort included an average grade of 8.75% copper over 313 feet; these are eye-popping grades that could allow the company to improve the economics significantly at Canyon. . .the company will produce a revised resource estimate for the project in mid-Q1/17."

		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(11/8/16)

		
		"While these are obviously dire times for uranium companies, the
fact that Energy Fuels Inc. was able to raise such a large sum is a sign that the smart money believes the market is going to turn around at some point. This Jibes with my own thinking on the market-as the world's demand for baseload power continues to accelerate. . .Energy Fuels boasts both current production and the ability to quickly ramp up that production with favorable prices. . .we'll move Engergy Fuels to a hold for now, but one that will be a buy again once this market finds its bottom."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(11/7/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is positioned to weather the downturn in uranium markets with a healthy cash balance of $17.5 million and over 550,000 pounds of uranium in inventory, which could be converted into cash should the firm require additional liquidity. . .in addition to strong uranium intercepts already uncovered,on October 27, 2016 Energy Fuels Inc. announced the discovery of strong high-grade copper at the Canyon Project. . . we feel the firm has accumulated a strong combination of both conventional and ISR uranium projects that should provide investors with great leverage to potentially increasing uranium prices going forward. . .we are reiterating our Buy rating and $5.00 per share price target."

		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(11/4/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has implemented positive cash management measures   including changes to management compensation as well as bringing  forward future uranium contract deliveries at modest discounts. . .production from conventional sources amounted to 260,000 lbs which topped our forecast of 144,000 lbs, while production from the ISR Nichols ranch property amounted to 90,000 lbs, topping our forecast of 74,613 lbs. . .we continue to view Energy Fuels as a strong uranium price leverage play with the production capability to be the dominant U.S. domestic producer. . .we are maintain our Buy recommendation and are lowering the  target price to C$5.65/share, or by 15%, to reflect the impact of bringing 2017 sales into 2016."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(11/4/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc.'s Q3/16 adjusted results beat consensus, but a new Q4 outlook is likely more impactful. . .production beat our forecast slightly; COGS and realized prices beat considerably. . .we now forecast Q4 revenue tripling QoQ to US$21 MM, almost 6x our previous forecast, as inventory is consumed. . .we'd like to think the cost is worthwhile: new Nichols wellfields, shaft sinking,a copper discovery at Canyon, and uranium in White Mesa tailings suitable for low cost extraction. . .we recommend Energy Fuels with a BUY and target price of C$6.00/sh, based on our 10% DCF model."  
		
		









  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(10/31/16)

		
		"A total of 620,000 lbs U3O8 will likely be enough for Energy Fuels Inc. to become the top American uranium  producer. . .White Mesa is  the only licensed and operating mill in the US; and is one of the only  facilities in North America that may process and recycle alternate  feed materials to recover uranium. . .Energy Fuels is highly leveraged  to uranium prices given it owns the largest undeveloped resource base  in the US at ~150MM lbs, having recently acquired another production  center. . .we reiterate our BUY recommendation for Energy Fuels with a target price of C$6.00/sh, based on our 10% DCF model."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Exploration Insights
(10/30/16)

		
		"Drilling at the Energy Fuels Inc.'s Canyon Mine Uranium project returned some impressive copper intersections associated with the uranium mineralization, including 31.69% copper with 3.96% U3O8 and 3.8 ounces per tonne of silver over 5 feet or 1.5 meters. Copper mineralization associated with uranium-bearing breccia pipes in Arizona has been documented before, but not at these grades. . .the potential to add a significant by-product revenue stream from copper and (maybe) silver to the Canyon Project is a positive. . .we continue to hold in anticipation of an improvement in the uranium market."
		
		












  
      Colin Healey, Haywood Securities
  

(10/28/16)

		
		"Drilling at Energy Fuels Inc.'s Canyon Mine in Northern Arizona has intersected significant copper mineralization in five holes in its 'middle' zone, ~1,200 1,400 feet below surface. . .five holes from drilling at the Canyon uranium mine were sampled  for  copper  and returned  significant  grades, averaging  8.75%  Cu  over  the  composited  intervals  across  the  five holes (313 feet), including 1 interval of 5 feet grading 31.69% copper. . .the potential for a significant by-product credit is further revealed, with EFR intersecting copper mineralization both within the existing uranium resource area, as well as outside."

		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(10/27/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has discovered an extensive system of high-grade copper mineralization at its 100%-owned Canyon mine located in northern Arizona. . .the Canyon mine is already the highest grade uranium mine in the U.S. and the discovery of high-grade copper may lead to valuable by-product credits that will further reduce the uranium cost production profile of this mine. . .the copper occurs inside and outside the mineralized uranium envelope, which suggests that there may be larger copper tonnage at Canyon. . .we reiterate our Buy recommendation and a C$7.05 per share target price."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(10/27/16)

		
		"Copper and silver mineralization was identified at Energy Fuels Inc.'s Canyon Mine; initial underground results average 8.75% Cu, 0.45% U3O8, 1.41 oz/ton Ag. . .management will review the ability to recover copper as a byproduct of uranium recovery. [There is] potential to improve economics at this already high-grade uranium mine. . .Canyon is fully licensed, permitted and at an advanced stage of construction. . .mining is expected for next yearalthough uranium is not sold forward."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(10/17/16)

		
		"As a result of our lower uranium price forecasts and the additional dilution from EFR's September 2016 capital raise, we are cutting our price target from $3.75 to $3.25; we attribute the majority of our price revision to our lower uranium price forecasts. Despite our lower price target, we continue to believe that Energy Fuels has a strong asset portfolio, which should allow the company to demonstrate strong production growth once the uranium price recovers."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Exploration Insights
(10/2/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. remains keen on advancing the higher-grade (1.5 Mlb grading ~1.0% U3O8) Canyon project in Arizonaa potentially low-cost producer (US$20-23 per pound)to a development decision by the first quarter of 2017. . .the Nichols Ranch and Alta Mesa ISR projects operated by Energy Fuels represent low-cost production that requires minimal capital to ramp up in an improving market environment. . .we continue to hold in anticipation of an improvement in the uranium market, which we think will generate a significant and positive impact on the share price."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(10/1/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. provided strong justification for its continued inclusion on our list of uranium plays. . .while the energy metal is suffering through a weak price environment, the company is positioning itself perfectly to take advantage of the next big surge in uranium prices. . .Energy Fuels continues to prepare for the day
when it can hit the accelerator on its producing and take full advantage of the uranium bull market I see on the horizon. . .Energy Fuels share price dropped immediately upon the announcement of the financing that I view as a buying opportunity. . .as we await the seemingly inevitable rebound in uranium, the company is a buy."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(9/22/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is in a great position to weather the spot market
downturn. With spot uranium prices currently around $25 per pound,
we believe looking towards somewhat defensive uranium plays may
be prudent. To that end, Energy Fuels has long-term contracts in place
with significantly higher selling prices than the current spot market.
For 2017, the firm has over 600,000 pounds of uranium contracted
to be sold at a price of approximately $60 per pound, which we
feel alleviates much of the pressures associated with the prolonged
downturn in the spot market. Furthermore, on September 20, 2016,
the firm completed a $15.0 million financing."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Exploration Insights
(9/18/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc.'s goal remains to become the largest U.S.-based U3O8 producer. . .the company is one of a few uranium producers with the capability to produce U3O8 from a variety of sources including conventional milling and in-situ recovery. . .it has a global resource (Measured and Indicated + Inferred including Reserves) of over 150 million pounds of U3O8. . .improved markets could lead the company to return to production levels of 4-6 million pounds a year in the medium term."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(9/12/16)

		
		"We reiterate our BUY recommendation for Energy Fuels Inc. and increase our target price to C$6. . .a 2017 guidance update today beat our expectations, spelling out priorities through 2018. . .the goal is to sustain production capability, ramp up potential and resources, ultimately becoming the largest US producer; it should achieve this in 2017. . .While not the lowest cost producer, we do believe EFR has more optionality than most. Management has a proven track record of dealing with multiple uranium sources, finding lower cost feed and how to blend it."
		
		












  
      Eric Coffin, HRA Advisory
  

(9/6/16)

		
		"I continue to think Energy Fuels Inc. is the best play for a potential increase in uranium prices but the timing of that increase is as uncertain as ever. On the back of a money raise and renegotiation and extension of its convertible debentures EFR has been carrying out exploration on its Wyoming ISL and Arizona hard rock uranium projects. . .in Wyoming, drilling for a new wellfield development for Header House 9 at Nicholl Ranch has encountered widespread mineralization. . .in Arizona, delineation drilling at the Canyon mine project has reported a number of high- er than resource grade intercepts."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(9/1/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc.'s assets are currently operating far below capacity, a fact which puts it in the proverbial catbirds seat when prices rise. You see, while other uranium companies will struggle through the lengthy process of getting their development-level project permitted, EFR has the pounds-in-the-ground and the processing infrastructure to quickly monetize any significant uptick in uranium prices. . .at Nichols Ranch, drilling to operationalize the Header House 9 wellfield has also yielded intriguing results. Of the 52 holes drilled on this area, 46 have encountered significant mineralization and one hole intersected 5.0 feet of 2.40% U3O8."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Exploration Insights
(8/21/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. released the results from drilling at its Nichols Ranch in situ recovery uranium operation in Wyoming and the Canyon Mine conventional milling project in Arizona. . .the Canyon Mine is EFR's highest-grade conventional milling project. . .higher than expected grades from delineation drilling at a wellhead that is slated for production at Nichols Ranch in the latter part of 2016 is also a positive for generating more incremental cash flow. High grades from the Canyon Mine could make the project a priority to bring into production by 2017 and feed the underutilized White Mesa Mill in Utah."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners

		"Energy Fuels Inc. released its financial results for Q2 2016. Results were mixed in our view as revenues were higher than expected and EPS loss was greater than anticipated. . .Revenue of $7.0 million was well above our estimate of $2.9 million due to the timing of contract shipments. . .We note EPS was negatively impacted by a $1.6 million inventory write down and other non-cash items. . .we are maintaining our Buy rating as we believe Energy Fuels should see a recovery in its share price as uranium market conditions improve later this year."

		"We reiterate our Energy Fuels Inc. BUY recommendation and target price of C$5.80/share. . .Due to vast undeveloped resources, and a number  of  permitted  and  ready-to-go projects; EFR remains a top pick for leverage in a rising price environment. . . EFR trades at a slight discount to peers with a P/NAV of 0.51x versus 0.57x, likely since production growth is so price dependent. However, should prices rise we expect EFR to outperform, tapping into an impressive portfolio of mine-ready projects."

		"Energy Fuels Inc. reported a resource for its 100%-owned Alta Mesa in situ recovery (ISR) uranium project in southern Texas . . .the maiden resource at Alta Mesa is comparable to the grade at EFR's operating Nichols Ranch ISR plant in Wyoming (0.11-0.12% vs. 0.13% U3O8) but with significantly more volume as it contains ~16.8 million pounds of U3O8 in the Inferred resource category. . .the Alta Mesa ISR plant represents an asset that can be brought on-line fairly quickly with minimal upfront capital as its grade is comparable to Nichol's Ranch."
		
		












  
      Colin Healey, Haywood Securities
  

(8/2/16)

		
		"The maiden resource estimate for [Energy Fuels Inc.'s] Alta Mesa confirms identical tons/grade of the 'Historic' resource, which was part of the basis of acquisition. . .we consider EFR well positioned to resume operations at Alta Mesa when uranium prices justify, noting EFRs extensive in-house expertise with the assets. . .EFR has effectively amassed a strategic land package in the United States surrounding the White Mesa mill which could support an extended mine life in an elevated uranium price environment."

		"Energy Fuels Inc. is seeking approval to amend the terms of its floating-rate convertible unsecured subordinated debentures with the holders at a meeting on Aug. 4, 2016. . .amending the terms of the convertible debt facility is yet another example of the company trying to pull a lever to manage its working capital. If the current depressed market conditions persist, we would expect EFR to remain solvent into 2017 to take advantage of the potential market turnaround and keep the 'call' option (based on the 11.5 Mlb of permitted annual capacity) on the uranium price alive."

(5/9/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc.'s long-term contracts continue to allow for production to be sold at a greater than 50% premium to spot prices, which directly contributes to the firm's ability to achieve a 33% gross margin during the quarter. While uranium companies without higher priced long-term contracts continue to somewhat struggle with current spot prices, we feel Energy Fuels remains uniquely positioned to not only survive, but thrive during the downturn in spot prices with average contract prices of approximately $59 per pound through 2017 while continuing to stockpile excess production for when higher uranium prices prevail."
		
		












The Energy Report Interview with Joe Reagor 

(5/9/16)

		
		"With Energy Fuels Inc. acquiring Uranerz Energy Corp. last year, the company has moved to being a lower-cost producer and to have a mix between conventional and in situ recovery (ISR). When a uranium price recovery happens, Energy Fuels has a significant number of assets that could be brought into production, some former producers, some larger assets with large capital budgets. So Energy Fuels has a little bit more leverage to the uranium price than some of the other companies we cover.  . .Energy Fuels has done a good job of selling some of the assets that it had smaller stakes in and purchasing the remaining interest in some of the assets that it thinks are more elite. Energy Fuels also purchased an ISR mill in Texas, which gives it another potential location to process uranium. The company had a number of smaller projects in Texas, and it picked up some more projects with the mill."

The Gold Report Interview with Brien Lundin 

(5/3/16)

		
		"One of the companies I've recommended for a while is Energy Fuels Inc. The company is a fairly diversified producer and is the second largest producer in North America. It's one of the survivors from the uranium mania that we had about 10 years ago. Energy Fuels acquired other junior companies over the years and has built up a remarkable portfolio of producing and near-production assets. Because it's in production right now, it can benefit immediately from rising uranium prices. It also has a number of projects that it can bring on-line fairly quickly to also give it upside leverage. So I really like Energy Fuels."

		"Few uranium companies are better positioned than Energy Fuels Inc. to leverage a rising uranium price environment, when it materializes. The company made a flurry of news this month, including a key in-situ recovery acquisition in Texas, a boosting of its
interest in the Roca Honda project to 100%, a successful equity financing and the release of 2015 financials. . .the good news for investors is that Energy Fuels has all the tools to crank up production once higher prices arrive. . .the pullback in the share price makes now a good time to build or add to your position."

The Gold Report Interview with Eric Coffin 

(2/23/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. has ISR production and a little bit of conventional production tailored to meet existing long-term contracts. The long-term price of most of its contracts is about $55/lb. It makes a bit of money at that. Energy Fuels has just expanded its ISR production a little bit, but it is also in the middle of permitting two larger resources. It owns the only conventional uranium mill in the U.S., and it can take advantage of a price move. Uranium is one of those funny markets where if things start to move, it could move quickly, so I wanted to be positioned in something where I felt we were getting a really good price. I wrote it up at $2.50/share in December because it had a pretty bad tax-loss season. It's trading at about CA$3.303.40/share now. If we do get a spike and the uranium price goes up to $70/lb, Energy Fuels is in a position to sign long-term contracts and actually deliver uranium into those contracts. It's probably going to do 800,000 lbs this year, but it could take that up to a couple of million pounds fairly easily with very little capex. It would just be a matter of starting to produce from these small conventional deposits and feeding them into the mill it already owns."

The  Gold Report Interview with Rick Mills 

(1/21/16)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is set up to be the premier U.S./North American uranium producer. It's undervalued, and that's why it's well worth putting on your radar screen. You buy at the bottom because of what you think is going to happen in the future. . .Energy Fuels has two of North America's key production centers: the White Mesa mill in Utah and the Nichols Ranch processing facility in Wyoming, which it acquired when it took over Uranerz Energy Corp. The White Mesa mill is the only conventional uranium mill operating in the U.S., and it has a licensed capacity of over 8 Mlb/year U3O8. The Nichols Ranch processing facility is an in situ recovery center with a licensed capacity of 2 Mlb. Energy Fuels has the largest NI 43-101 uranium resource portfolio in the U.S. and two producing mines."

The  Energy Report Interview with Rob Chang 

(12/22/15)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. is the only conventional uranium producer in the U.S. and the second-largest producer overall. It has the potential become #1, given the projects and mines it has on standby or that are close to being in development. At full ramp-up we expect the company to be able to produce 57 Mlb/year, in a country currently producing 45 Mlb/year. The U.S. consumes 55 Mlb/year, but only about 10% is supplied domestically. U.S. utilities seeking security of supply will greatly prefer U.S. producers over those from Kazakhstan, Russia or Africa. This company is well positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices.

The Gold Report Interview with Eric Coffin 

(12/17/15)

		
		"The one uranium story that I'm following is Energy Fuels Inc. The company produces uranium from both in situ recovery (ISR) and at the White Mesa mill in Utah, the only operating conventional mill in the U.S. Energy Fuels will probably produce 700800 Klb next year, not a big producer. It makes a little money on production and has a good working capital position. It has permitted a number of small resources close to the mill and is working on expanding ISR. . .management doesn't really want to expand production unless the uranium price moves sufficiently higher, but it is one of the few companies that it is in a position to write long-term sales contracts and deliver into them at two, three or four times its current production rate. The company is adding a couple more header houses at its ISR operation. Energy Fuels could probably take Nichols Ranch, which is the current unit, the Hank unit and Jane Doe, which it is just finishing permitting on, up to 1.52 Mlb per year. That would probably take a year or two, but it only makes sense to boost production at above $50/lb uranium, at a minimum. The selling that it is doing right now is on long-term contracts priced at about $55/lb. . .it has two or three smaller hard rock uranium resources in breccia pipes fairly close to its White Mesa mill. Three of those, ranging in size from 0.5, 1, 1.5 Mlb each, are already permitted. Its lead time on those is probably from three to nine months. It has a couple of larger resources as well, though they are not as far along in the permitting process. And White Mesa is permitted for 8 Mlb/year, so it's not remotely close to capacity."

      Eric Coffin, Hard Rock Analyst
(12/2/15)

		
		"Energy Fuels Inc. currently produces from its in-situ recovery operations at Nichols Ranch and, on a campaign as-needed basis, from its conventional hard-rock uranium mill at White Mesa. . .the company is permitting at a number of small resources that could feed White Mesa as well as building out capacity at Nichols. . .in addition, larger resources are a couple of years away from permitting. It's this expansion potential that makes Energy Fuels most interesting, coupled with the fact that management clearly has no intention of pulling the trigger unless prices are right."

(11/25/15)

		
		"We reiterate our Buy recommendation on Energy Fuels Inc. . .an agreement to sell several non-core assets to EnCore Energy was signed, we estimate worth $0.8M. . .a positive divestiture for Energy Fuels, although perhaps immaterial from an economic cash standpoint, it does provide future optionality."
