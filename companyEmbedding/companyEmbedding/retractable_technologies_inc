                Retractable Technologies, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets safety needle devices for the healthcare industry. The company's VanishPoint products utilize a patented friction ring mechanism. The friction ring mechanism permits the automated retraction of the needle into the barrel of the syringe, directly from the patient, after delivery of the medication is completed. VanishPoint products are designed specifically to prevent needlestick injuries and to prevent reuse. The VanishPoint blood collection tube holder utilizes the same mechanism to retract the needle after blood has been drawn from the patient. Retractable Technologies was founded by Thomas J. Shaw on May 9, 1994 and is headquartered in Little Elm, TX.

VanishPoint® syringes

VanishPoint syringes have been called "the gold standard for retractable needle syringes."*  They are available in a variety of sizes (0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10mL), needle gauges, and needle lengths. The needle is automatically retracted directly from the patient into the barrel of the syringe when the plunger handle is fully depressed. The pre-removal, automated retraction virtually eliminates exposure to the contaminated needle, effectively reducing the risk of needlestick injury. 

VanishPoint syringes are  easy to use, require no additional steps, and allow for single-handed activation. After activation, they require less disposal space than most other safety needles/syringes and prevent disposal-related needlestick injuries.

EasyPoint® needles

NEW EasyPoint retractable needles feature automated retraction technology and pre-removal capability that has made Retractable Technologies the industry standard, but with added versatility. They can be used with luer lock and luer slip syringes, including pre-filled syringes.
When the color-coded activation tab is pressed, the needle automatically retracts into the safety chamber and remains enclosed through disposal. EasyPoint retractable
needles are easy to use, allowing single-handed activation, while the clinician's fingers remain behind the exposed sharp at all times.

Blood collection devices
safe, smooth sample collection
 


 








VanishPointŽ blood collection sets
 Automated in-vein retraction effectively reduces the risk of needlestick injuries during blood collection. The trigger indicator is color coded to easily identify needle gauge, and the design of the finger grips allows for easy handling. When activated, needle retraction clamps the tubing, reducing the risk chance of exposure to blood. Another unique feature is the clear body, which allows for flashback visualization.
The trigger design reduces the risk of inadvertent activation. VanishPoint blood collection sets are not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP.

VanishPointŽ blood collection tube holders

The needle is automatically retracted from the patient when the end-cap is closed after the last tube has been removed. This pre-removal activation virtually eliminates exposure to both ends of the contaminated needle and allows users to keep both hands behind the needle when activating, reducing the risk of needlestick injuries.
VanishPoint blood collection tube holders are single-use, adhere to safety regulations, and are compatible with standard, multiple-sample blood collection needles.

safety integrated venipuncture
 


 








VanishPoint® IV catheters
The VanishPoint safety IV catheter utilizes patented automated retraction technology similar to that of the VanishPoint syringe and blood collection tube holder. It is easy to use and allows for one-handed venipuncture. It contains an integrated safety mechanism that, when activated, automatically retracts the introducer needle, which remains safely retracted inside the housing until disposal, reducing the risk of a needlestick injury.
Unlike other IV catheters, VanishPoint IV catheters do not require additional components such as sliding sheaths, metal clips or activation buttons. VanishPoint catheters are available in a variety of sizes, each color-coded according to international standards to indicate the catheter gauge.
