Sorry, TWC Customers: Charter Acquisition Means No More “Maxx” Upgrades For You
Image courtesy of Photo Nut 2011



August 11, 2016 10:39 am EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdcnew and not improved charter time warner cable time charter cable twc maxx 
Remember that whole thing where Time Warner Cable was going to install really fast internet upgrades and try to suck a whole lot less? Yeah, that. Well, like the TWC brand itself, the plan to upgrade cities to “Maxx” internet speed is now being left in the dust thanks to the acquisition by Charter.
In 2014 and 2015, TWC made much ado of its plans to upgrade its cable and broadband services to a new service called “TWC Maxx.” Maxx was to give users speeds up to 300 Mbps, where previously TWC’s broadband options had maxed out at around 50 Mbps. Austin was up first, followed by Charlotte — both, conveniently enough, Google Fiber cities. New York and Los Angeles were also both on the list.
But as tech news site DSL Reports first noticed, those plans have been put on hold. Hard.
DSL Reports first noticed the pause in June, but it started even earlier than that, in late May.
Charter has its own upgrade plans it plans to put in place across the TWC footprint they now own, but those plans offer slower speed at higher prices than the Maxx rollout promised. Charter’s offering a $60 60 Mbps option and a $100 100 Mbps one, where TWC’s upgrade plans topped out at 300 Mbps and claimed not to increase prices above what subscribers were earlier paying to get 50 Mbps.
And even that, Charter and TWC customers should perhaps not hold their breath waiting for. The company’s CFO said in a recent earnings call that the TWC digital strategy is “largely put on hold” as the company works on Charter’s all digital strategy in “the beginning of next year.”
It makes sense that Charter would be putting a hold on any TWC-only programs, since now they are faced with the complicated task of trying to integrate and unify three companies’ worth of systems — and they’ve long since said they’re killing off the TWC brand in order to bring all subscribers together as Charter Spectrum customers.
Analysts have also long supposed that in the immediate aftermath of the merger, customers could expect service and customer care to languish, with improvements on the medium-to-long term horizon at best.

TIME WARNER CABLE MEDIA MAKES BUYING CABLE SPOTS SIMPLER AND EASIER BY OFFERING ADVERTISERS AT&T U-VERSE INVENTORY - Time Warner Cable Media Increases Regional Advertising Reach with Agreement to Represent AT&T U-verse TV in Los Angeles, Dallas and other Select Markets

Release Date: 04/05/2011


(NEW YORK, NY) – Time Warner Cable Media, the advertising sales division of Time Warner Cable, and AT&T Advanced Ad Solutions, the national advertising sales division of AT&T*, today announced an agreement making it easier for advertisers to reach television viewers in markets where AT&T and TWC provide multi-channel service. With this agreement, TWC Media will sell ads across more than 50 popular ad supported cable networks like TBS, USA and ESPN HD in the following markets throughout the year:

Los Angeles, Dallas, Cleveland, San Antonio, Milwaukee, Austin and other cities where Time Warner Cable and AT&T are both video providers.

“We are excited to provide our regional advertising partners with a simple and easy way to increase their reach,” said Joan Gillman, President of Time Warner Cable Media Sales.  “This agreement is a continuation of our strategy to provide the most advanced video advertising solutions across the largest footprint.  We are delighted to add AT&T U-verse® to our current partners.”
“We look forward to working together to make AT&T U-verse inventory available to local market television advertisers through the TWC Media sales team,” said Greg McCastle, SVP, AT&T Advanced Ad Solutions. “This new agreement will add qualitative and quantitative value to the local advertising offerings put forth by the Time Warner Cable sales team and make life easier for media buyers in terms of seamless planning and buying.”
Added Gillman, “We are constantly seeking to provide a one-stop shop for advertisers by offering cutting edge features and seamless collaboration that meets their reach and engagement needs.  We have had great feedback on our previous initiatives to increase reach in key markets, and we will continue to build the relationships necessary to facilitate effective, efficient advertising.”
NCC, the nation’s largest spot cable sales organization, will manage multi-market buys on both the Time Warner Cable and AT&T U-verse TV services for national advertisers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

American Media Productions to Launch SportsNet LA as the New Home for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2014


01/28/2013

Download this Press Release ()

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Los Angeles Dodgers ownership group created American Media Productions, LLC (AMP) in December 2012 to launch a new Los Angeles Dodgers regional sports network. Today, AMP announced its plans for SportsNet LA, the new regional television home for the Los Angeles Dodgers beginning with the 2014 Major League Baseball season. In addition to being the exclusive local home for all of the Dodger games, SportsNet LA will provide comprehensive behind-the-scenes Dodger programming, featuring more insights, analysis and commentary about the team than ever available before.
Time Warner Cable (TWC) has agreed to be SportsNet LA’s charter distributor, and will carry the new network for its customers throughout Southern California and Hawaii under a long-term affiliation deal. In addition, in return for agreeing to make payments over the life of the deal, TWC will be the exclusive advertising and affiliate sales agent for the new network and will have certain branding and programing rights with respect to the network. TWC will also provide certain non-game production and technical services to AMP.
Mark Walter, Chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers, said, “We concluded last year that the best way to give our fans what they want - more content and more Dodger baseball - was to launch our own network. The creation of AMP will provide substantial financial resources over the coming years for the Dodgers to build on their storied legacy and bring a World Championship home to Los Angeles. Just as we are actively transforming the team and the stadium, we want the Dodgers to be exhibited on the very best sports network in the country - one that will provide an unrivaled fan experience.”
Todd Boehly, a principal owner of AMP, said, “We are greatly pleased that Time Warner Cable, the largest distributor in the marketplace, has come aboard to support the Dodgers and SportsNet LA as our charter distributor. Their presence in Los Angeles will be invaluable in helping us serve Dodger fans and our community with excellence.”
“We are delighted to support the Dodgers and their ownership group in their launch of SportsNet LA. The Dodgers have one of the most passionate and loyal audiences in sports, and we look forward to helping deliver this new network to their fans,” said David Rone, President of Time Warner Cable Sports. “This deal, like our Lakers’ deal, furthers our efforts to attain greater certainty and control over local and regional sports programming costs.”
The agreement with TWC is subject to certain closing conditions. Additional terms were not disclosed.

Please Read and Acknowledge the Safe Harbor Statement Below in order to Gain Access to the Webcast
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this communication regarding the proposed transaction between Charter and Time Warner Cable and the proposed transaction between Bright House and Charter, including any statements regarding the expected timetable for completing the transaction, benefits and synergies of the transaction, future opportunities for the respective companies and products, and any other statements regarding Charter’s, Time Warner Cable’s and Bright House’s future expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, financial conditions, assumptions or future events or performance that are not historical facts are “forward-looking” statements made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “will,” “may,” “intend,” “estimated,” “aim,” “on track,” “target,” “opportunity,” “tentative,” “positioning,” “designed,” “create,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “would,” “could,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “upside,” “increases,” and “potential” and similar expressions. All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in the statements. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are the following: the timing to consummate the proposed transactions; the risk that a condition to closing the proposed transactions may not be satisfied; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed transactions is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; Charter’s ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the proposed transactions; Charter’s ability to promptly, efficiently and effectively integrate acquired operations into its own operations; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in Charter’s and Time Warner Cable’s respective filings with the SEC, including Charter’s and Time Warner Cable’s most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Charter and Time Warner Cable assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof.
