SCVPY-US‘s change in revenue this period compared to the same period last year of -4.88% is almost the same as its change in earnings, and is about average among the announced results thus far in its peer group, suggesting that SCVPY-US is holding onto its market share.

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s earnings growth was influenced by year-on-year improvement in gross margins from 21.69% to 22.78% as well as better cost controls.  As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) rose from 15.51% to 16.53% compared to the same period last year.  For comparison, gross margins were 24.46% and EBITDA margins were 17.63% in the last reporting period.

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.


SCVPY-US‘s gross margin improvement has not produced any big difference in its working capital.  Working capital days are currently 25.74, compared to last year’s level of 22.41 days.  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely from operating decisions and not trade-offs with the balance sheet.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
SCVPY-US‘s change in operating cash flow of 71.83% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period.  Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group.  This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable.

Margins
The company’s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from 10.07% to 10.52% and (2) one-time items. The company’s pretax margins are now 12.32% compared to 11.08% for the same period last year.

COMPANY HISTORY & PROFILE

The company was first established on May 16, 1969 as Siam City Cement Company Limited with the initial registered capital of 100 million baht and began cement production after the completion of its cement plant in 1972. 



A major development at the company came in 1998 when
					Holcim Limited of Switzerland became a major shareholder.
					Then in 1999, debt restructuring and refinancing was
					completed with the capital increased to 3,000 million baht.
					Siam City Cement Plc continued to expand their
					production capacity and new products in the market while.


					On December 21,2012, a change in major shareholding occurred when
					Thai Roc-Cem Company Limited and HOLDERFIN B.V. sold their holdings
					in the amount of 21,390,000 shares in the aggregate, representing 9.3
					percent of the issued and outstanding capital shares of the company, to
					Bangkok Broadcasting and Television Limited, a company in the Ratanarak
					Group. Thus, the proportion of the Ratanarak Group shareholding to
					increase to 104,360,272 shares or approximately 45.37 percent of the
					issued and outstanding capital shares.
				



					After five years of continuously successful operation, the company
					proudly became a listed company in the Stock Exchange of Thailand
					in 1977. Then in 1981, the company’s Saraburi plant endeavored
					to replace the imported bunker oil used as fuel in cement production
					to domestically sourced lignite coal.
				

					In order to reduce the consumption of fuel which represented a major
					cost of cement production, in 1989 the company became the first cement
					producer in Southeast Asia to introduce a waste heat recovery system
					which converted heat captured from the cement kiln to produce electricity.
					Then in 1993, the company was officially renamed “Siam City Cement
					Public Company Limited”  to reflect the nature of its being a fully listed
					company in Thailand’s stock exchange.
				


					In 2013, SCCC acquired assets of two Superblock Plc light-weight block
					plants-the Singburi operations early in the year, and the Ratchaburi plant
					towards the end of the year.
				


				In 2014, The Company achieved Carbon Footprint for Product (CFP) and Carbon Footprint Reduction labels from Thailand Greenhouse Management Organization (TGO). Moreover, the Company also received the Green Industry Level 5 ( Green Network) award, which is the highest level awarded by the Ministry of Industry. This makes us the first company in the cement industry to have all of its three plants awarded Green Industry Level 5 certification.
