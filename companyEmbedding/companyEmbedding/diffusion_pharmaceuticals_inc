Company Overview


Diffusion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company focused on improving the effectiveness of standard-of-care therapies for life-threatening treatment-resistant solid cancerous tumors, without adding harmful side effects.
 
The company is developing its lead drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), which has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for use in a number of cancers in which tumor hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) diminishes the efficacy of current treatments. TSC targets the cancer’s hypoxic micro-environment, re-oxygenating treatment-resistant tissue and making the cancerous cells more vulnerable to the therapeutic effects of conventional radiation and chemotherapy.
 
The company is poised to begin a pivotal phase 3 trial in Glioblastoma (GBM). Other programs include clinical trials in pancreatic cancer and brain metastases. Because TSC’s novel mechanism safely re-oxygenates a wide range of tumor types, its use is not limited to a specific tumor tissue, but has the potential to treat numerous life-threatening cancers.

Technology Overview


Oxygen deprivation at the cellular level (“hypoxia”) is the result of rapid tumor growth, causing the tumor to outgrow its blood supply. Cancerous tumor cells actually thrive on hypoxia, as the resultant changes in the tumor microenvironment confer “treatment resistance” to radiation and chemotherapy treatments within the hypoxic cancerous cell.

 





Mechanism of Action: TSC’s unique re-oxygenation capabilities derive from its novel mechanism of action, promoting enhanced diffusion of oxygen through the blood plasma and into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

Oxygen levels of normal tissue remain unaffected, thereby avoiding the introduction of additional harmful side effects. Disruption of the treatment-resistance syndrome by re-oxygenation promotes enhanced cancer killing power from standard radiation and chemotherapy treatments, thereby safely extending survival.

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DFFN) is a publicly traded biotechnology and drug development company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.[1] It was co-founded in 2001 by American life sciences entrepreneur David Kalergis and University of Virginia Chemical Engineering Professor John L. Gainer.[1] Gainer is the inventor of the company’s platform technology of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its lead drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC).[2] TSC acts to increase the rate at which oxygen moves through blood plasma by the process of diffusion,[3] a phenomenon that forms the basis for the company's name. TSC and other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, including bipolar trans carotenoid salts (the subclass to which TSC belongs), have been investigated by Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for treatment of conditions associated with reduced oxygen availability in tissues (hypoxia).[1][3]

Research activities[edit]




Entrance to Diffusion Pharmaceuticals laboratories.


Gainer invented the concept of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its specific embodiment, TSC, while a Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia. He secured the first patent on the molecule and its uses in 2000. Before TSC's invention, he and colleagues conducted research on the effects of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds in various animal disease models, including atherosclerosis, arthritis and cancer. At that time, crocetin, a naturally occurring carotenoid compound, was the focus of their research. With the invention of TSC, their research turned to the potential use of this synthetic oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound for the improved treatment of hemorrhagic shock (shock caused by the loss of a large volume of blood) on the battlefield.[2][3][4] This research, which was supported financially by the United States Office of Naval Research (ONR), was conducted in Gainer’s University of Virginia laboratory. Following the company's formation by Kalergis and Gainer in 2001, both ONR[5] and private funding[6] was obtained, enabling company researchers to set up their own laboratory and, along with collaborators, perform further preclinical studies into uses of TSC in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and other hypoxic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and cancer.[3][7][8][9]
Clinical trials[edit]
In 2007, TSC was advanced into clinical trials in humans. Clinical investigation first centered on the drug's safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in normal healthy volunteers. This was followed in 2009-2010 by a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining TSC’s safety and efficacy in the re-oxygenation of tissues in patients affected by peripheral artery disease.[10] The company is currently investigating the use of TSC as a radiation and chemo sensitizer in the treatment of solid cancerous tumors.
Intellectual property[edit]
Between 2008 and 2017, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals expanded its intellectual property portfolio, having been awarded new patents (in the United States and internationally) that covered the synthesis and uses of bipolar trans carotenoid salts and related compounds in peripheral artery disease, cancer and other indications.[11] In 2011, TSC received an orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the use of TSC as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. In accordance with standard practice, the Orphan Drug designation for TSC confers benefits including enhanced patent protection and marketing rights, waiver of certain FDA filing fees and favorable tax treatment.[12] By mid-2017, the company had been issued 14 U.S. and 46 international patents.[11]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals won the Virginia Healthcare Innovators award in the “Medical Product or Device ” category for its development of TSC.[13]

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DFFN) is a publicly traded biotechnology and drug development company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.[1] It was co-founded in 2001 by American life sciences entrepreneur David Kalergis and University of Virginia Chemical Engineering Professor John L. Gainer.[1] Gainer is the inventor of the company’s platform technology of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its lead drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC).[2] TSC acts to increase the rate at which oxygen moves through blood plasma by the process of diffusion,[3] a phenomenon that forms the basis for the company's name. TSC and other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, including bipolar trans carotenoid salts (the subclass to which TSC belongs), have been investigated by Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for treatment of conditions associated with reduced oxygen availability in tissues (hypoxia).[1][3]

Research activities[edit]




Entrance to Diffusion Pharmaceuticals laboratories.


Gainer invented the concept of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its specific embodiment, TSC, while a Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia. He secured the first patent on the molecule and its uses in 2000. Before TSC's invention, he and colleagues conducted research on the effects of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds in various animal disease models, including atherosclerosis, arthritis and cancer. At that time, crocetin, a naturally occurring carotenoid compound, was the focus of their research. With the invention of TSC, their research turned to the potential use of this synthetic oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound for the improved treatment of hemorrhagic shock (shock caused by the loss of a large volume of blood) on the battlefield.[2][3][4] This research, which was supported financially by the United States Office of Naval Research (ONR), was conducted in Gainer’s University of Virginia laboratory. Following the company's formation by Kalergis and Gainer in 2001, both ONR[5] and private funding[6] was obtained, enabling company researchers to set up their own laboratory and, along with collaborators, perform further preclinical studies into uses of TSC in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and other hypoxic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and cancer.[3][7][8][9]
Clinical trials[edit]
In 2007, TSC was advanced into clinical trials in humans. Clinical investigation first centered on the drug's safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in normal healthy volunteers. This was followed in 2009-2010 by a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining TSC’s safety and efficacy in the re-oxygenation of tissues in patients affected by peripheral artery disease.[10] The company is currently investigating the use of TSC as a radiation and chemo sensitizer in the treatment of solid cancerous tumors.
Intellectual property[edit]
Between 2008 and 2017, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals expanded its intellectual property portfolio, having been awarded new patents (in the United States and internationally) that covered the synthesis and uses of bipolar trans carotenoid salts and related compounds in peripheral artery disease, cancer and other indications.[11] In 2011, TSC received an orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the use of TSC as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. In accordance with standard practice, the Orphan Drug designation for TSC confers benefits including enhanced patent protection and marketing rights, waiver of certain FDA filing fees and favorable tax treatment.[12] By mid-2017, the company had been issued 14 U.S. and 46 international patents.[11]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals won the Virginia Healthcare Innovators award in the “Medical Product or Device ” category for its development of TSC.[13]

Overview / Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC)


A successful Phase1/2 trial of TSC in newly diagnosed GBM patients was completed in 2015. Subsequently, agreement was reached with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the design of a single Phase 3 study that would support registration of TSC for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients, in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy. Discussion is currently underway with the regulatory authorities regarding design of a clinical development program in pancreatic cancer. Trials in brain metastasis are in the planning stages, with enrollment expected following interim results in the pancreatic cancer study.  TSC has received Orphan Drug Designation for the potential treatment of GBM and brain metastasis, and expects to receive Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer in the near future.

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc Achieves Drug Production Milestone for Planned Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Inoperable GBM Brain Cancer
Jul 20 17
Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. has reported the completion of a major production run of its lead drug candidate trans sodium crocetinate (TSC). This drug supply will be used in its planned Phase 3 trial which will test TSC in the treatment of newly diagnosed inoperable glioblastoma (GBM) brain cancer patients and is of sufficient quantity to support the entire trial. Diffusion plans to initiate this clinical trial by the end of 2017. Diffusion is now interacting with the FDA on details regarding the design and execution of the planned Phase 3 study, with initiation planned for later this year. The study will focus on newly diagnosed GBM patients who have been judged by their medical team to be inoperable, usually because of the size or location of the tumor. Because of their poor prognosis, these patients are often excluded from participation in other GBM clinical trials. In the Company’s Phase 2 GBM study, the TSC-treated group showed a nearly four-fold increase in survival at two years, when compared to the historical controls.

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Receives Non-Compliance Notice From The Nasdaq
May 26 17
On May 23, 2017, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. received a written notice from the staff (the “Staff”) of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) because the market value of the Company’s listed securities had been below $35 million for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The Staff also noted that as of such date the Company also did not meet the alternative requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), due to the Company’s failure to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million, or Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(3), due to the Company’s failure to generate net income from continuing operations during its last fiscal year or during two of its last three fiscal years. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the notice, or until November 20, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities requirement or the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement. To regain compliance, the market value of the Company's listed securities must close at $35 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days or the Company must report stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million. Nasdaq’s written notice has no effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock at this time, and the Company is currently evaluating its alternatives to resolve this listing deficiency.

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Appoints Dr. Robert Ruffolo to Board of Directors




















July 06, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.






CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., July  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:DFFN), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel small molecule therapeutics for cancer and other hypoxia-related diseases, today announced the appointment of Robert R. Ruffolo, Jr., Ph.D., to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. “We are delighted to welcome Bob to the Board,” stated David Kalergis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “His comprehensive pharmaceutical industry experience and drug development knowledge will add real value to Diffusion.” Dr. Ruffolo currently serves as President of Ruffolo Consulting, LLC, and sits on the Boards of Directors for numerous biotechnology companies, in addition to several non-profit charitable organizations. He previously served as President of Research and Development of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Corporate Senior Vice President of Wyeth (now Pfizer). Previously Dr. Ruffolo spent 17 years at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (now GlaxoSmithKline) as Senior Vice President and Director of Biological Sciences, Worldwide, and before that, he was Chairman of the Cardiovascular Research Committee at Lilly Research Laboratories. During his distinguished career in the pharmaceuticals industry, Dr. Ruffolo played a significant role in the discovery and/or development of marketed products such as Carvedilol for the treatment of heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, Ropinirole for Parkinson’s disease, Dobutamine for congestive heart failure and Eprosartan for hypertension. He has authored nearly 500 full-length publications and over 200 abstracts, in addition to editing 15 books. Dr. Ruffolo was Editor-in-Chief of four international scientific journals, and has served on the editorial board of 29 international scientific journals. He has received numerous prestigious awards throughout his career, including the Discoverers Award for Carvedilol in heart failure. Dr. Ruffolo received a B.S. degree in pharmacy and his Ph.D. degree in pharmacology from The Ohio State University.  Thereafter, he spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health. About Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on extending the life expectancy of cancer patients by improving the effectiveness of current standard of care treatments including radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Diffusion is developing its lead product candidate, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), for use in the many cancer types in which tumor hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) is known to diminish the effectiveness of current treatments. TSC targets the cancer's hypoxic micro-environment, re-oxygenating treatment-resistant tissue and making the cancer cells more vulnerable to the therapeutic effects of treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy, without the apparent addition of any serious side effects. A Phase 2 clinical program, completed in the second quarter of 2015, evaluated 59 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This open label, historically controlled study demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile for TSC combined with standard of care, including a 37% improvement in overall survival over the control group at two years.  A particularly strong efficacy signal was seen in the subset of inoperable patients where survival of TSC-treated patients at two years was increased by almost fourfold over the controls. At an End-Of-Phase 2 Meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided Diffusion with extensive guidance on the design for a Phase 3 trial of TSC in newly diagnosed GBM patients.   Assuming FDA sign-off on our final protocol design, focusing on the inoperable patients, the study is planned to initiate by the end of 2017.  Due to its novel mechanism of action, TSC has safely re-oxygenated a range of tumor types in our preclinical and clinical studies.  Diffusion believes its therapeutic potential is not limited to specific tumors, thereby making it potentially useful to improve standard-of-care treatments of other life-threatening cancers.  Additional planned studies include a Phase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer and a study in brain metastases, with study initiation subject to receipt of additional funding or collaborative partnering.  The Company also believes that TSC has potential application in other indications involving hypoxia, such as neurodegenerative diseases and emergency medicine, and an in-ambulance trial of TSC in stroke is under consideration. Forward-Looking Statements To the extent any statements made in this news release deal with information that is not historical, these are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the company's plans, objectives, expectations  and intentions with respect to future operations and products, the potential of the company's technology and product candidates, the anticipated timing of future clinical trials and protocol review, the anticipated financial position, operating results and growth prospects of the company and other statements that are not historical in nature, particularly those that utilize terminology such as "would," "will," "plans," "possibility," "potential," "future," "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "intends," "continue," "expects," other words of similar meaning, derivations of such words and the use of future dates. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.

Description




Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc., formerly RestorGenex Corporation, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is focused on developing standard-of-care treatments, including radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The Company's lead product candidate, transcrocetinate sodium, also known as trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) is used in various cancer types, in which tumor oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) is known to diminish the effectiveness of treatments. The Company's Diffusion's technology is targeted at overcoming treatment-resistance in solid cancerous tumors by combining its lead product candidate, TSC, with standard-of-care radiation and chemotherapy regimens, thus effecting a better patient survival outcome without the addition of harmful side effects. Its clinical development plan targets TSC at the radiation and chemotherapy sensitization of hypoxic tumor types, with an initial focus on primary brain cancer (glioblastoma or GBM), pancreatic cancer, and brain metastases.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 





 Share

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

















THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DFFN) is a publicly traded biotechnology and drug development company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.[1] It was co-founded in 2001 by American life sciences entrepreneur David Kalergis and University of Virginia Chemical Engineering Professor John L. Gainer.[1] Gainer is the inventor of the company’s platform technology of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its lead drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC).[2] TSC acts to increase the rate at which oxygen moves through blood plasma by the process of diffusion,[3] a phenomenon that forms the basis for the company's name. TSC and other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, including bipolar trans carotenoid salts (the subclass to which TSC belongs), have been investigated by Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for treatment of conditions associated with reduced oxygen availability in tissues (hypoxia).[1][3]

Research activities[edit]




Entrance to Diffusion Pharmaceuticals laboratories.


Gainer invented the concept of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its specific embodiment, TSC, while a Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia. He secured the first patent on the molecule and its uses in 2000. Before TSC's invention, he and colleagues conducted research on the effects of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds in various animal disease models, including atherosclerosis, arthritis and cancer. At that time, crocetin, a naturally occurring carotenoid compound, was the focus of their research. With the invention of TSC, their research turned to the potential use of this synthetic oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound for the improved treatment of hemorrhagic shock (shock caused by the loss of a large volume of blood) on the battlefield.[2][3][4] This research, which was supported financially by the United States Office of Naval Research (ONR), was conducted in Gainer’s University of Virginia laboratory. Following the company's formation by Kalergis and Gainer in 2001, both ONR[5] and private funding[6] was obtained, enabling company researchers to set up their own laboratory and, along with collaborators, perform further preclinical studies into uses of TSC in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and other hypoxic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and cancer.[3][7][8][9]
Clinical trials[edit]
In 2007, TSC was advanced into clinical trials in humans. Clinical investigation first centered on the drug's safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in normal healthy volunteers. This was followed in 2009-2010 by a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining TSC’s safety and efficacy in the re-oxygenation of tissues in patients affected by peripheral artery disease.[10] The company is currently investigating the use of TSC as a radiation and chemo sensitizer in the treatment of solid cancerous tumors.
Intellectual property[edit]
Between 2008 and 2017, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals expanded its intellectual property portfolio, having been awarded new patents (in the United States and internationally) that covered the synthesis and uses of bipolar trans carotenoid salts and related compounds in peripheral artery disease, cancer and other indications.[11] In 2011, TSC received an orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the use of TSC as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. In accordance with standard practice, the Orphan Drug designation for TSC confers benefits including enhanced patent protection and marketing rights, waiver of certain FDA filing fees and favorable tax treatment.[12] By mid-2017, the company had been issued 14 U.S. and 46 international patents.[11]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals won the Virginia Healthcare Innovators award in the “Medical Product or Device ” category for its development of TSC.[13]

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DFFN) is a publicly traded biotechnology and drug development company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.[1] It was co-founded in 2001 by American life sciences entrepreneur David Kalergis and University of Virginia Chemical Engineering Professor John L. Gainer.[1] Gainer is the inventor of the company’s platform technology of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its lead drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC).[2] TSC acts to increase the rate at which oxygen moves through blood plasma by the process of diffusion,[3] a phenomenon that forms the basis for the company's name. TSC and other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, including bipolar trans carotenoid salts (the subclass to which TSC belongs), have been investigated by Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for treatment of conditions associated with reduced oxygen availability in tissues (hypoxia).[1][3]

Research activities[edit]




Entrance to Diffusion Pharmaceuticals laboratories.


Gainer invented the concept of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds and its specific embodiment, TSC, while a Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia. He secured the first patent on the molecule and its uses in 2000. Before TSC's invention, he and colleagues conducted research on the effects of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds in various animal disease models, including atherosclerosis, arthritis and cancer. At that time, crocetin, a naturally occurring carotenoid compound, was the focus of their research. With the invention of TSC, their research turned to the potential use of this synthetic oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound for the improved treatment of hemorrhagic shock (shock caused by the loss of a large volume of blood) on the battlefield.[2][3][4] This research, which was supported financially by the United States Office of Naval Research (ONR), was conducted in Gainer’s University of Virginia laboratory. Following the company's formation by Kalergis and Gainer in 2001, both ONR[5] and private funding[6] was obtained, enabling company researchers to set up their own laboratory and, along with collaborators, perform further preclinical studies into uses of TSC in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and other hypoxic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and cancer.[3][7][8][9]
Clinical trials[edit]
In 2007, TSC was advanced into clinical trials in humans. Clinical investigation first centered on the drug's safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in normal healthy volunteers. This was followed in 2009-2010 by a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining TSC’s safety and efficacy in the re-oxygenation of tissues in patients affected by peripheral artery disease.[10] The company is currently investigating the use of TSC as a radiation and chemo sensitizer in the treatment of solid cancerous tumors.
Intellectual property[edit]
Between 2008 and 2017, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals expanded its intellectual property portfolio, having been awarded new patents (in the United States and internationally) that covered the synthesis and uses of bipolar trans carotenoid salts and related compounds in peripheral artery disease, cancer and other indications.[11] In 2011, TSC received an orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the use of TSC as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. In accordance with standard practice, the Orphan Drug designation for TSC confers benefits including enhanced patent protection and marketing rights, waiver of certain FDA filing fees and favorable tax treatment.[12] By mid-2017, the company had been issued 14 U.S. and 46 international patents.[11]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals won the Virginia Healthcare Innovators award in the “Medical Product or Device ” category for its development of TSC.[13]
