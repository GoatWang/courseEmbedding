    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.
Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. of New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vontobel Holding AG of Switzerland that specializes in managing long-only global equity portfolios.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.
Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. of New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vontobel Holding AG of Switzerland that specializes in managing long-only global equity portfolios.

Investment Opportunity


							Strong demand for U.S. energy infrastructure, including oil and gas pipelines, will continue to drive
						

							sizeable capital investment. Midstream Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and General Partners
						

							(GPs) are uniquely positioned to match producer supply with end-user demand.
						

							The Fund strives to generate attractive total returns by investing primarily in energy MLPs and GPs
						

							that own midstream oil and natural gas assets which are backed back by long-term, fee-based
						

							contracts. The Fund will be overweighted to GPs, which are well-positioned to capitalize on
						

							midstream M&A activity and may offer superior growth prospects to MLPs.
						

							Duff & Phelps’ experienced MLP team will seek to utilize its deep fundamental, bottom-up approach to
						

							capture cash distributions and distribution growth opportunities across the U.S. energy value chain.

STEP 3


							A combination of both quantitative risk modeling and qualitative assessment determines overall
						

							portfolio construction, viewed through a contribution-to-risk framework, rather than a traditional
						

							asset allocation lens
						

							Portfolio construction is anchored by three principles:
						

1.


							Is the portfolio structured to meet the stated risk-return profile?
						

2.


							Does the portfolio deliver substantial liquidity?
						

3.


							Is the portfolio scalable?
						

							Construct portfolio of 25-35 strategies
						

STEP 2


							Bottom-up investment process seeks to divide opportunities into
						

							three buckets:
						

1.


							Strategies driven by the differences between the house view
						

							and what the rest of the market believes
						

2.


							Strategies seeking to exploit market mispricings
						

3.


							Risk-reducing strategies anticipated to perform well during
						

							times of market stress, including times when the house
						

							view does not play out
						

STEP 1


							Develop a macro house view that drives investment decision making

							The Fund seeks to deliver a positive return of
						

							5% per annum above the Fed Funds Target
						

							Rate, on a gross of fees basis, on average,
						

							over rolling three year periods, regardless
						

							of the prevailing stock market environment.
						

							In seeking to target this level of return,
						

							the Fund also aims to manage volatility
						

							to a target of less than half that of global
						

							equities, measured over the same rolling
						

							three year periods. The Fund may be suitable
						

							for investors who seek a benchmark-agnostic
						

							core investment that stretches across
						

							traditional and non-traditional asset classes.

Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share: The market worth of one share of a mutual fund. This figure is calculated by subtracting a fund's liabilities from total assets (securities, cash and any accrued earnings) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.
Public Offering Price (POP): The price at which a fund's shares can be purchased. The offering price includes the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any sales charges.
On each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, the net asset value (NAV) is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 pm Eastern Time). The NAV and POP for all funds are subject to change.

Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
