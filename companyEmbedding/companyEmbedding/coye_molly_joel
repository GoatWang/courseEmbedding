ACHIEVEMENT

Dr. Coye founded the Health Technology Center, a non-profit group dedicated to advancing the use of beneficial technologies for healthier people and communities where she is currently CEO.


























I was inspired to study medicine in order to improve community health.
I studied the social upheavals in China, and the public health campaigns to eradicate infectious diseases and provide clean water and basic health care. 

























Dr. Molly Joel Coye is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Health Technology Center, a non-profit organization which promotes the use of new technologies to improve the health of individuals and communities. She has run health departments in two states, has served as director of a health care policy group, and has also directed product development for a consumer software company. Dr. Coye enjoys the challenge of taking on such different tasks and has built a very varied career.
Molly Coye was born in Bennington, Vermont, to Robert D. Coye, M.D., a doctor, and Janet Loper Nelson, a mental health planner. She was surrounded by aspects of the medical world growing up, and well remembers visiting her father's pathology laboratory and coming home to "intense discussions of politics and how to improve health care." Despite this family background, Molly Coye did not decide to go to medical school until she was 27 years old. First, she earned a B.A. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley, and then spent the next two years studying history and Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan. While there, she became increasingly interested in the role of health care in society and cost-effective strategies for providing care for the poor and underserved. She returned to the United States and completed a master's degree in history at Stanford University and then enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She graduated with an M.D. degree and an M.P.H. from the School of Hygiene and Public Health at Hopkins in 1977.
Dr. Coye completed an internship in family practice at San Francisco General Hospital in 1978 and served as a fellow in the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program from 1978 to 1980. She moved into public health policy at the government level in her first job as a medical investigative officer for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1980 whilst simultaneously serving as chief of the occupational health clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. 
In 1986 Dr. Coye was appointed commissioner of health for the state of New Jersey, the first of two posts leading state health departments. The second was the directorship of the department of health services for the state of California, from 1991 to 1993, where she managed a budget of more than $16 billion and 5,000 employees. In 1988, two years into her three-year tenure as commissioner in New Jersey, Dr. Coye had her son Langston. Apparently the nurses were so nervous about treating the commissioner of health that they struggled to insert her intravenous drip! Between 1979 and 1994 Dr. Coye has also held a series of academic appointments at the University of California and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. 
Since leaving the California state department in 1993, Dr. Coye has held leadership positions at a number of health care organizations and has served as a consultant to venture capital firms specializing in health technology and communications. In 2001, she founded the Health Technology Center, a non-profit group dedicated to advancing the use of beneficial technologies for healthier people and communities where she is currently CEO. Dr. Coye was also a founding member of the California Endowment, the largest philanthropy in health care in California.
Dr. Coye has chaired the executive board, the action board, and the occupational health and safety section of the American Public Health Association and has served on the editorial board of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, Environmental Health Perspectives and the California Health Law Monitor. In 1988 she received the Virginia Apgar Award, and in 1993 the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association awarded her the Woodrow Wilson Award for Distinguished Government Service. Amongst numerous other honors, she was also named "Woman of the New Year" by Jersey Woman in 1988 and "Woman of the Year" by Northern California Women Healthcare Executives in 2003.

























What was my biggest obstacle? 
Because I had not concentrated on science as an undergraduate in college, I had to return to the university to take the pre-medical science courses, and I had to convince the medical schools that my application was sincere and well thought out.
How do I make a difference? 
In every setting, I try to discover solutions that will build support for increased access to health care, and improve the quality of care that patients and families receive. I create new programs and legislation and ways of thinking about health care.
Who was your mentor? 
Dr. Barbara Starfield, a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins, helped me to understand that research and scholarship could contribute to social change and better healthcare. She also showed me that having a family would help me be a better leader and thinkerthere is no reason to sacrifice family life.
My mother, Janet Loper Nelson, was a mental health planner. She was an advisor on health issues to Governor Pat Lucy of Wisconsin twenty yearsalmost exactlybefore I joined the staff of Govenor Tom Kean in New Jersey as an advisor on health. She built a movement, got legislation passed in Michigan to create the first patient's rights advocacy program within mental health institutions, and then headed that new agency for eight years. Quite a role model! When I first began giving speeches on public health at the American Public Health Association, our names would be found in the programs listed alphabetically right after each other, because she would be presenting on mental health topics. My father, Robert D. Coye, M.D., is a pathologist and was dean of the Wayne State School of Medicine for ten yearshe was the one who taught me to question authority, argue for what I wanted and keep a sense of humor.

SPOTLIGHT / Molly Joel Coye: Bringing hospitals the latest technology

1 / 1


Back to Gallery
















Dr. Molly Joel Coye has the tough task of keeping hospitals abreast of the latest technological advances, even though many are struggling to make ends meet. 
Despite the financial and logistical strains on many hospitals and their staffs, Coye, chief executive of San Francisco's Health Technology Center, a nonprofit medical technology assessment group, believes what the latest technology has to offer can play a decisive role in improving health care. 
"We're one of the few resources out there to help delivery systems plan and identify what's out there in the pipeline," she said, adding that her group evaluates technologies, but does not focus on prices and does not advise individual hospitals what to do. 



Latest business videos




 
What's out there is a range of disease-oriented and computerized technologies -- from inhalers that will replace injections to monitors that fit in a vest a patient can wear. Many are surprisingly straightforward and based on existing technologies, such as wireless locators that can help hospital staff find each other within the hospital. Others, such as implantable devices to support various organs, may take longer to test and adopt. 
"Even in the worst of times, hospitals have to keep investing in technology, 
because it's a part of their mission, and it's what their physicians expect. We're trying to help them make the best decisions they can make," Coye said from her office in the South of Market. 
Coye founded the center, which is known as HealthTech, in 2000. HealthTech has 15 employees and is funded by 28 member organizations, including Kaiser Permanente and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. 
Coye's career, which she jokingly referred to as "checkered," hasn't been exclusively in technology, but she has always been interested in searching for solutions to prevent problems and medical mistakes before they occur. 
Coye, a Wisconsin native who received both her medical degree and masters in public health from Johns Hopkins University, left San Francisco General Hospital after practicing just five years in family and occupational medicine, because she wanted to focus on preventing rather than just treating diseases. 
Among her many positions, she headed the state health departments in both New Jersey and California, served as executive vice president at the Good Samaritan Health System in the Santa Clara Valley and was the product development director for HealthDesk Corp., a Berkeley company that developed interactive health and disease-management software for consumers. 
As a member of the Institute of Medicine, Coye was also behind two highly publicized reports that shook up the medical establishment. The first, in 1999, 
reported that as many as 98,000 Americans a year die from preventable medical errors. A follow-up report in 2001 found that it took an average of 17 years for new research knowledge to become incorporated into standard practice. 
Coye gives hospitals and the medical community credit for owning up to some of the problems identified in the report and trying to address them. 
Wanda Jones, president of the New Century Health Care Institute in San Francisco, commended Coye for her efforts but thinks she has her work cut out for her. 
While some hospitals are on solid financial footing, Jones said many are still shell-shocked from the drop in revenue they experienced because of managed-care contracts in the 1990s. "It's like going through a war. You don't forget," she said. "They (hospitals) are fearful of spending money on anything optional, and they consider new technologies as optional." 
But Coye said many new technologies actually save money by improving efficiencies or by detecting health problems before they wind up costing even more. 
Coye said she's seeing exciting improvements in remote Internet-based management of intensive-care units, or ICUs, because of a current shortage in intensive-care specialists. 
She said the technology, which is already used in some hospitals throughout the country, allows an off-site specialist to see and know everything that is going on in that ICU through remote feeds and to advise the medical staff accordingly. 
One local hospital system currently using such a system is Sutter Health, which has been a HealthTech member since the group's inception. 
In January, Sutter started using remote intensive-care monitoring in two of its 26 hospitals, Sutter Memorial and Sutter General in Sacramento, and plans to expand its use, according to Sutter's chief medical officer, Dr. Gordon Hunt. 
Hunt said HealthTech has been particularly helpful in helping Sutter develop its system to archive digital radiological images. In addition, Sutter expects to spend as much as $4 billion over the next 10 years to build new hospitals and outpatient clinics and relies on HealthTech to help answer some important design questions. 
"What will the hospital of the future look like, what will the operating room look like? How will technologies of the future affect how we deliver care?" Hunt asked, explaining that the construction is necessary for expansion as well as meeting seismic upgrading requirements. 
"HealthTech is working on these issues three or five or even 10 years on the horizon that you really need to address," Hunt said. 
Robert Merwin, chief executive of Mills-Peninsula Health Services, said HealthTech has been helpful in designing the replacement for the Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame. Construction will begin in 2006. 
For example, Merwin said, such design features as a larger operating room have been incorporated to accommodate the robotic surgical systems that 
HealthTech believes will be a key part of the operating room of the future. 
Coye said with advancements in so-called keyhole or minimally invasive surgeries, an increasing number of surgical procedures will be done in an outpatient setting. Doctors will be able to train for the procedures using computers, the way pilots train with flight simulators. 
In terms of medical device advancements, Coye said inhaled insulin for diabetics will be available in the next couple of years. Within five years, she said, dialysis will be used for people with liver disease.
