History[edit]
The Fifth Street entities were founded by Leonard M. Tannenbaum in 1998.[1]
Fifth Street Asset Management owns two publicly traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corporation and Fifth Street Floating Rate Corporation.[1] Fifth Street Finance Corporation was founded in 1998 and launched its IPO in 2008[9] and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corporation was established in 2013.[10]
In 2014, Fifth Street Finance partnered with the Kemper Corporation on two joint ventures, which allow lenders to take on and re-distribute more debt, for $200 million in equity commitments and $400 million in leverage. Other firms that have entered into these agreements include Solar Capital and THL Credit. Fifth Street Asset Management also has two senior loan funds on its books.[11]
In the summer of 2014 they made decisions that cost their investors to lose their investment value. In July 2014 they issued new shares to grow their balance sheet, but set these shares at a new price and that, after fees, diluted the wealth of existing shareholders. In August 2014 Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp a business development company, managed by the same manager as Fifth Street Finance Corp. issued millions of new shares at a price of $12.14, a 20% discount to the previously reported net asset value per share of $15.13. This led to shareholders losing millions of dollars. [12]
In October 2014, Fifth Street Asset Management completed its initial public offering and is currently listed on the NASDAQ(NASDAQ: FSAM). The company had initially withdrawn its initial public offering, only to then amend it on October 28 and reduce the initial offering by 50 percent.[2] Originally, the company planned to issue 8 million shares at between $24 to $26 per share.[1] Company shares declined 21 percent to $13.37 on its first day of trading after opening at $17 per share.[2]
Total revenues increased by 4.6%, or $1.1 million, to $24.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to $23.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The growth in total revenues was driven by a 22.4% increase in year-over-year fee-earning AUM. Management fees (which include base management fees and Part I fees) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $23.6 million, or 94.8% of total revenues.[13]
Recognitions[edit]
Fifth Street Finance Corp. has received an investment grade rating from Standard & Poor's and ranks among the top Business Development Companies based on its market capitalization. Fifth Street received the 2014 ACG New York Champion's Award for "Senior Lender Firm of the Year" and was named in 2013 the Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Lender of the Year.[14]
Local involvement[edit]
Fifth Street Asset Management, together with GE, Ernst & Young, KPMG and UBS help sponsor the Junior Achievement program for young Connecticut entrepreneurs.[15]

History[edit]
The Fifth Street entities were founded by Leonard M. Tannenbaum in 1998.[1]
Fifth Street Asset Management owns two publicly traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corporation and Fifth Street Floating Rate Corporation.[1] Fifth Street Finance Corporation was founded in 1998 and launched its IPO in 2008[9] and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corporation was established in 2013.[10]
In 2014, Fifth Street Finance partnered with the Kemper Corporation on two joint ventures, which allow lenders to take on and re-distribute more debt, for $200 million in equity commitments and $400 million in leverage. Other firms that have entered into these agreements include Solar Capital and THL Credit. Fifth Street Asset Management also has two senior loan funds on its books.[11]
In the summer of 2014 they made decisions that cost their investors to lose their investment value. In July 2014 they issued new shares to grow their balance sheet, but set these shares at a new price and that, after fees, diluted the wealth of existing shareholders. In August 2014 Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp a business development company, managed by the same manager as Fifth Street Finance Corp. issued millions of new shares at a price of $12.14, a 20% discount to the previously reported net asset value per share of $15.13. This led to shareholders losing millions of dollars. [12]
In October 2014, Fifth Street Asset Management completed its initial public offering and is currently listed on the NASDAQ(NASDAQ: FSAM). The company had initially withdrawn its initial public offering, only to then amend it on October 28 and reduce the initial offering by 50 percent.[2] Originally, the company planned to issue 8 million shares at between $24 to $26 per share.[1] Company shares declined 21 percent to $13.37 on its first day of trading after opening at $17 per share.[2]
Total revenues increased by 4.6%, or $1.1 million, to $24.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to $23.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The growth in total revenues was driven by a 22.4% increase in year-over-year fee-earning AUM. Management fees (which include base management fees and Part I fees) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $23.6 million, or 94.8% of total revenues.[13]
Recognitions[edit]
Fifth Street Finance Corp. has received an investment grade rating from Standard & Poor's and ranks among the top Business Development Companies based on its market capitalization. Fifth Street received the 2014 ACG New York Champion's Award for "Senior Lender Firm of the Year" and was named in 2013 the Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Lender of the Year.[14]
Local involvement[edit]
Fifth Street Asset Management, together with GE, Ernst & Young, KPMG and UBS help sponsor the Junior Achievement program for young Connecticut entrepreneurs.[15]

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
