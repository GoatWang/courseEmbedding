time to time by the Selling Security Holders beginning immediately after the 
registration statement effective date, which is the date of this prospectus. We 
are completing this registration statement to allow the Selling Security Holders
to sell their shares. We, the issuer, will not receive any proceeds from the 
common stock sale by the Selling Security Holders in this offering. MITU will 
pay all expenses of this offering estimated at $29,802.14.


We face strong competition from other mining companies for the acquisition of 
new properties. New properties increase the probability of discovering a 
profitable reserve. Most companies have greater financial and managerial 
resources than we do and can acquire and explore attractive new mining 
properties. We will face similar difficulties raising new capital to expand 
operations against the larger, better capitalized competitors. Limited supply 
and unforeseen demand from larger, more competitive companies may make secure 
all necessary equipment and materials difficult and may result in periodic 
interruptions or even business failure. Success depends on a combination of 
many factors including but not limited to: the quality of management, technical 
(geological) expertise, quality of land available for exploration and the 
capital available for exploration.


Company Description
We are a start-up, exploration stage mining company formed to explore mineral 
properties for gold. We have purchased a 100% interest in a nine-unit claim 
block (“MITU Gold Claim”) containing 92.5 hectares that have been staked and 
recorded with the Bogota Regional Office of the Ministry of


 Mining of the 
Republic of Colombia. The claim was purchased on April 25, 2013 from Alvarez 
Explorations Inc. for the sum of $5000.00. We do not currently have the 
necessary funds to undergo exploration of this property and will need to raise 
capital in order to do so. If we cannot, we may have to go out of business. The 
proposed two phase exploration plan will cost approximately $19,712. There has 
been no production to date. There are no full-time employees and management is 
able to spend only a small amount of time with respect to these affairs. MITU 
has no other assets.

Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements: 

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K may include statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These 
forward-looking statements reflect MITU Resources Inc.’s current views about future events and financial performances. These "forward-looking" statements are identified by the use of terms and phrases such as "will," "believe," "expect," 
"plan," "anticipate," and similar expressions identifying forward-looking statements. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from our expectation. These factors include, for example: regulatory and permitting issues; timing and outcome of exploration proposals; future financial performances of MITU and its projects; the estimation of mineral 
resources and the realization of mineral reserves; exploration, development, and production activities and estimated future production; costs of production, capital, operating and exploration expenditure estimates; additional capital requirements 
and acquisition; government regulation, environmental risks, reclamation and rehabilitation expenses; title disputes or claims; insurance coverage; future prices of gold and other minerals and all risk factors discussed in the sections entitled 
“Item A risk Factors” and item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K. Such statements made by us fall within the safe harbors provided by Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results and the actual results we achieve may differ materially from 
these estimates due to these and other risk factors as discussed in the sections entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K. MITU Resources 
Inc. expressly does not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements. 


PART I 


Item 1. 
Business 
Overview
We are a start-up exploration stage mining company with one 
mineral claim (the MITU Gold claim) in the Republic of Colombia. Our goal is to 
generate revenues through the sale of gold found and extracted from this claim. 
We have a specific business plan to complete exploration work on this claim and 
have no reason to alter this plan within the next twelve months. The company has 
no subsidiaries, affiliates or joint venture partners. We do not intend to enter 
into a merger or acquisition, have not been involved in any large purchases 
other than that of the MITU Gold Claim and have not been involved in any 
reclassification, bankruptcy or receivership since inception.
MITU Resources Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the 
State of Nevada April 17, 2013, by Juan Perez and another, former, officer to 
acquire and develop gold properties.
We acquired the MITU Gold Claim from Alvarez Explorations Inc. 
("Alvarez") located in the Republic of the Colombia on April17, 2013 for the sum 
of $5,000. The only terms between the Company and Alvarez are the payment of the 
purchase price by the Company to Alvarez, and the transfer of the MITU Gold 
Claim from Alvarez to the Company. The MITU Gold Claim is our only mineral claim 
and only material asset. 
In April 2013, we engaged a mining consultant, Jorge 
Villaneuva, to develop a Technical Report for the development of the MITU Claim. 
Mr. Villaneuva has proposed a two phase exploration program of this property but 
no exploration has yet been carried out. There are no operations underway, no 
facilities other than the principal executive offices and no employees other 
than the two executive officers.
Assuming we can raise the necessary capital, we intend to carry 
out the exploration program proposed on the MITU Claim. There is the distinct 
possibility that we will not only fail to raise the capital but fail to find a 
commercially viable ore body. There is no guarantee that gold or any other 
substance of significant value will be found. We currently do not have any ore 
body, products or revenues.
We lease our principal executive offices at CLL 62B 32c-60, 
Bogota, Colombia. Our telephone number is +57225872251.
Emerging Growth Company 
We are an Emerging Growth Company as defined in the Jumpstart 
Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.
We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until 
the earliest of
(A) the last day of the fiscal year of 
the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as 
such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect 
the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or 
more;
(B) the last day of the fiscal year of 
the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of 
common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration 
statement;
(C) the date on which such issuer has, 
during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in 
non-convertible debt; or
(D) the date on which such issuer is 
deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b -2 of 
title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto..


As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 
404(b) of Regulation S-K. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish 
information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the 
internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This 
statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and 
procedures.
Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm 
shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the 
effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial 
reporting.
As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 14A 
(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the 
shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.
We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition 
period for complying with any new or revised accounting standards pursuant to 
Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
We will be conducting exploration activities in Columbia. If 
the U.S. dollar loses strength to the Columbian Peso (the COP) our future 
operations may be adversely affected.
There have been no purchases of our equity securities by us 
since inception. 
Regulation of Mining Activity- Republic of Colombia 
Mining Laws
We are currently in compliance with all material mining, 
health, safety, and environmental statutes of the Republic of Colombia.
Mining regulations in Colombia are predicated upon the 
principle that the subsoil and all mineral resources are property of the state 
and therefore may only be exploited with the permission of the National Mining 
Agency.
Columbian law grants the rights to explore and exploit mining 
reserves exclusively through mining concession agreements. These concession 
agreements include the exploration, construction and exploitation phases and are 
granted for periods of up to 30 years. The three phases covered by a concession 
agreement are as follows:



 

Exploration: This phase has an initial term of three 
      years, extendible for time periods of two years up to a maximum of 11 
      years. During this phase, the holder may perform the technical exploration 
      of the concession area. 


 

Construction: Once the exploration term lapses the holder 
      may begin the construction of the necessary infrastructure to perform 
      exploitation and related activities. This phase has an initial three-year 
      term, which may be extended for one additional year. 


 

Exploitation: During the remainder of the term minus the 
      two previous phases, the concession holder will be permitted to perform 
      exploitation activities. 
Concession agreements are granted for specific minerals within 
the concession area; however if the holder finds other minerals within the 
granted area, it may request that the mining authorities extend the object of 
the agreement to include them. We hold a concession agreement for the MITU Gold 
Claim.
Colombian laws distinguish between the environmental 
requirements for exploration activities and those that have to be fulfilled for 
construction and exploitation works. During the exploration phase, the 
concession holder does not need any specific environmental permit or license. 
There are no permitting, bonding or reclamation requirements for the exploration 
phase of a concession agreement.
In order to commence and perform construction and exploitation 
operations, however, the concession holder must obtain an environmental license. 
Environmental licenses include all the necessary permits and authorizations 
necessary for the construction and exploitation operations of a mining 
project.
In order to obtain an environmental license for a mining 
project, the concession holder must file an environmental impact assessment, 
which includes a description of the project, the natural renewable resources to 
be used and a report of the possible environmental impacts and the measures that 
are going to be taken to prevent, mitigate, correct or compensate them. The 
holder must also take out an insurance policy to cover any possible 
environmental damage.




The cost of complying with these environmental requirements should we determine to proceed with construction and exploitation operations cannot be determined at this time. Upon completion of exploration operations, if we decide based upon the 
results of those operations to proceed with construction and exploitation operations, we will be in a position to estimate the costs of complying with these environmental requirements.

We are in compliance with all governmental laws and regulations that bear upon the exploration of the MITU Gold Claim. There are no new regulations the adoption of which is probable that would affect our exploration or exploitation of the MITU Gold 
Claim.

Fees are due from the moment the area is declared available for the company (rather than from the time the concession contract is signed). Such fees change based on the size of the concession. The fees for the MITU Gold Claim will be $9.00 per 
hectare per year, or about $832.50 per year. 

Once exploration is complete and the mining infrastructure is in place, the concessionaire must begin paying royalties. Royalties paid to the Colombian government consist of a percentage of the primary product and sub-products being exploited. For 
gold, the percentage to be paid is four percent.

Any changes to current laws in the Republic of Colombia may require additional costs and financing. These changes are unpredictable and the additional requirements may render certain exploration activities uneconomical and lead to business 
failure.

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods

Although there can be no assurance, large and well capitalized markets are readily available for all metals and precious metals throughout the world. A very sophisticated futures market for the pricing and delivery of future production also exists. 
The price for metals is affected by a number of global factors, including economic strength and resultant demand for metals for production, fluctuating supplies, mining activities and production by others in the industry, and new and or reduced uses 
for subject metals.

The mining industry is highly speculative and of a very high risk nature. As such, mining activities involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Few mining 
projects actually become operating mines.

The mining industry is subject to a number of factors, including intense industry competition, high susceptibility to economic conditions (such as price of metal, foreign currency exchange rates, and capital and operating costs), and political 
conditions (which could affect such things as import and export regulations, foreign ownership restrictions). Furthermore, the mining activities are subject to all hazards incidental to mineral exploration, development and production, as well as 
risk of damage from earthquakes, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to or loss of property and equipment and possible environmental damage. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are also 
involved in mineral exploration and development.

Competition

The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new and exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and 
institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition 
of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders.

Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be 
able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater 
quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration 
interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.


We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies 
for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in 
such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies 
may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our 
acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in 
our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral 
exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, 
we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for 
available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, 
land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral 
exploration supplies and drill rigs.
General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by 
various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to 
time by the governments of Columbia, the United States and other countries, as 
well as factors beyond our control, including international political 
conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in 
acquiring, exploring or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or 
interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral 
properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or 
development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the gold or 
mineral industry by:


 
 
keeping our costs low; 

 
 
relying on the strength of our managements 
      contacts; and 



 

using our size and experience to our advantage by 
      adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to 
      potential opportunities. 
Intellectual Property
None. 
Research and Development
We have not incurred any research and development expenses 
since our inception. 
Reports to Security Holders
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the 
Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing 
financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting 
firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial 
statements for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year. We may also 
file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the 
course of our companys future operations. 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with 
the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 
20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public 
Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an 
Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other 
information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address 
of that site is www.sec.gov. 
Environmental Regulations
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental 
permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our future 
operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations 
relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any 
material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or 
other requirements. 
While our intended projects and business activities do not 
currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional 
restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely 
affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our 
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of future 
operations. 


Item 1A. 
Risk Factors 


Please consider the following risk factors before deciding 
to invest in our common stock. 
Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of 
risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, 
and all other information contained in this report, before you decide whether to 
purchase our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could 
harm our business. You may lose part or all of your investment due to any of 
these risks or uncertainties. Our stock is speculative and should be purchased 
only by those who can afford to lose their entire investment.
Risks Associated with our Company and our 
Industry
We are governed by only two people, which may lead to faulty 
corporate governance.
We have only one director  Juan Perez - and two executive 
officers  Mr. Perez and Nelson Rincon- who make all the decisions regarding 
corporate governance. These decisions will include their (executive) 
compensation, accounting overview, related party transactions and so on. Mr. 
Perez will have full control over matters that require Board of Directors 
approval. This may introduce conflicts of interest and prevent the segregation 
of executive duties from those that require Board of Directors approval. This 
may lead to ineffective disclosure and accounting controls. Noncompliance with 
laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties. They would have the 
ability to take any action that they review and approve. So long as they are the 
sole shareholders, they would exercise control over all matters requiring 
shareholder approval including significant corporate transactions. We have not 
implemented various corporate governance measures nor have we adopted any 
independent committees as we presently do not have any independent 
directors.
Our sole director and executive officers will own a 
substantial amount of common stock and will have substantial influence
over our operations denying an investor an effective voice .
Mr. Rincon owns 33%, or 10,000,000, of the 30,000,000 of our 
outstanding common shares. Mr. Perez has 16.7%, or 5,000,000, of the 30,000,000 
outstanding shares. Together, these holdings amount to almost 50% of our 
outstanding stock. 
Our director and officers are not residents of the United 
States making the enforcement of liabilities against them difficult .
Our director and executive officers reside outside the United 
States in the Republic of Columbia. If a shareholder wishes to sue them for 
damages, the shareholder would have to serve on them a summons and complaint. 
Even if personal service is accomplished and a judgement is entered against that 
person, the shareholder would then have to locate the assets of that person, and 
register the judgement in the foreign jurisdiction where the assets are 
located.
Our executive officers have other business interests which 
may limit the amount of time they can devote to our Company.
Our executive officers have other business interests, meaning 
they may not have enough time to devote to our business operations. This could 
cause business failure. They have been devoting and in the future plan to devote 
only 10 hours per month to company affairs which may lead to sporadic 
exploration activities and periodic interruptions of business operations. 
Unforeseen events may cause this amount of time to become even less. 
We must attract and maintain key personnel or our business 
will fail .
Success depends on the acquisition of key personnel. We will 
have to compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry 
to recruit and retain competent employees. If we cannot maintain qualified 
employees to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, this could have a 
material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
We are recently formed, lack an operating history and have 
yet to make any revenues. If we cannot generate any profits, you may lose 
your entire investment .
We are a recently formed company and have yet to generate any 
revenues. No profits have been made to date and if we fail to make any then we 
may fail as a business and an investment in our common stock will be worth 
nothing. We have no operating history and thus no way for you to measure 
progress or potential future success. Success has yet to be proved. Currently, 
there are no operations in place to produce revenue. We are exploration stage 
and have yet to find or produce sellable product. Financial losses should be 
expected to continue in the near future and at least until such time that we 
enter the production stage. As a new business we face all the risks of a 
start-up venture including unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and 
management limitations and difficulties. Since inception, we have a loss of 
approximately $13,239. There is no guarantee, unfortunately, that we may ever be 
able to turn a profit or locate additional opportunities, hire additional 
management and other personnel.


We need to acquire additional financing or our company will 
fail.
We must obtain additional capital or our business will fail. In 
order to explore the claim and eventually establish operations, we must secure 
more funds. Currently, we have very limited resources and have already 
accumulated a net loss. Unless we complete the planned exploration work on the 
MITU Gold Claim and commence operations, we will make no money, which may result 
in complete loss of your investment. Financing is also needed to bring product 
to market. Financing may be subject to numerous factors including investor 
sentiment, acceptance of mining claims and so on. We currently have no 
arrangements for additional financing. We may also have to borrow large sums of 
money that require substantial capital and interest payments. We must perform 
mineral explorations on the MITU Gold Claim to determine if any ore reserves are 
present and to keep the property in good standing. The planned exploration work 
alone is expected to cost $19,713. On March 31, 2015, we had cash of only 
$6,184.
The probability of a mineral claim having profitable 
reserves is very small and our claim, even with large investments, may
never generate a profit.
We are dependent upon our mining property for success. All 
anticipated future revenues would come directly from the MITU Gold Claim. Should 
we fail to extract and sell gold from this property, our business will fail. 
Mineral deposit estimates are imprecise and subject to error, and resource 
calculations when made may prove unreliable. Assumptions made regarding the 
supporting data may prove inaccurate and unforeseen events may lead to further 
inaccuracies. Sample variability, mining and processing adjustments, 
environmental changes, metal price fluctuations, and law and regulation changes 
are all factors that could lead to deviances from the original estimations. No 
assurances can be given that any mineral deposit estimate will ever be 
reclassified as a reserve. We have no known ore reserves. Despite future 
investment in exploration activities, there is no guarantee we will locate a 
commercially viable ore reserve. Most exploration projects do not result in 
discovery of commercially mineable deposits. With little capital available, we 
will have to limit our exploration which decreases the chances of finding a 
commercially viable ore body. Even if gold is identified, the MITU Gold Claim 
may not be put into production due to high extraction costs, low gold prices, or 
inadequate amount and reduced recovery rates. If the exploration activities do 
not suggest a commercially successful prospect then we may altogether abandon 
plans to develop the property.
The exploration and prospecting of minerals is speculative 
and extremely competitive which may make success difficult.
We face strong competition from other mining companies for the 
acquisition of new properties. New properties increase the probability of 
discovering a profitable reserve. Most companies have greater financial and 
managerial resources than we do and can acquire and explore attractive new 
mining properties. We will face similar difficulties raising new capital to 
expand operations against the larger, better capitalized competitors. Limited 
supply and unforeseen demand from larger, more competitive companies may make 
secure all necessary equipment and materials difficult and may result in 
periodic interruptions or even business failure. Success depends on a 
combination of many factors including but not limited to: the quality of 
management, technical (geological) expertise, quality of land available for 
exploration and the capital available for exploration.
International operations in Columbia are subject to inherent 
risks.
Political instability, uncertainty of the economic climate, 
currency fluctuations, exchange controls and taxation laws may be significant. 
Access to all of the equipment, supplies and materials necessary to begin 
exploration may not be available and delay such activity. We have not yet 
attempted to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products, equipment or 
materials but plan to do so when exploration begins. Exchange rate changes 
between the COP and the U.S. Dollar may also adversely affect success.
Our future operations may be adversely affected by future 
governmental and environmental regulations and permitting.
Environmental regulations may negatively affect the progression 
of operations and these regulations may become stricter in the future. In 
Columbia, all mining is regulated by the Deputy Minister of Mines and the 
National Mining Agency. Licenses and permits must be obtained from these 
entities as well as an environmental impact study developed for each mining 
property before starting mining activities. These are expensive and may affect 
the timing of operations. Pollution can be anticipated with mining activities. 
If we are unable to comply with current or future regulations, this may expose 
us to fines, penalties and litigation that could cause our business to fail.


We are subject to inherent mining hazards and risks that may 
result in future financial obligations.
Risks and hazards associated with the mining industry may 
adversely affect our operations such as but not limited to: political and 
country risks, industrial accidents, labor disputes, inability to retain 
necessary personnel or equipment, environmental hazards, unexpected geologic 
formations, cave-ins, landslides, flooding and monsoons, fires, explosions, 
power outages, processing problems. Personal injury and death could result as 
well as property damage, delays in mining, environmental damage, legal liability 
and monetary loss. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks 
at economically reasonable premiums. We do not carry any sort of insurance and 
may have difficulties obtaining such once operations start as insurance is 
generally sparse and cost prohibitive.
Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about 
our ability to continue as a going concern.
We incurred a net loss of ($44,711) for the period from April 
17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2015 and we expect to incur further 
losses in the development of our business, which raises substantial doubt about 
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We had cash of $6,184 as 
at March 31, 2015. We are in the development stage and have yet to attain 
profitable operations and in their report on our financial statements for the 
period from inception to March 31, 2015, our independent auditors included an 
explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to 
continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note 
disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our 
independent auditors. 
Our officers and director have never visited the MITU Gold 
Claim
If any feature of the MITU Gold Claim is obvious and might 
impede the claim's exploration, that feature might remain undiscovered because 
no officer or director of the Company has personally visited the claim.
Risks related to our stock
We may not be able to raise additional capital through the 
offering of more shares, and if we are able to do so it will dilute those 
shares issued and outstanding at the time of raise.
Raising additional capital through future offerings of common 
stock may be necessary for our company to continue operations, but there is no 
guarantee that this will be possible. Doing so will, however, dilute the total 
share number issued and outstanding. Financing may be achieved by issuing more 
shares which will increase the number of common shares outstanding. This may 
decrease the percentage interest held by each of our shareholders. Obtaining 
financing through the sale of our common stock will dilute other shareholders 
interests. As the total number of outstanding common shares increases, the 
equity attached to any individual share will decrease causing a dilution of 
shareholder ownership over the company. With little other access to funds 
currently, we may have to rely on this method substantially to raise additional 
capital.
There is no market for our common stock meaning that you may 
not be able to resell your shares .
Our common stock currently has no market limiting shareholders 
ability to resell them or use them as collateral. Thus, the shareholder must 
sell their shares privately which may prove very difficult. The shares are not 
currently listed on any exchange or quotation system. Private sales are more 
difficult and often give lower than anticipated prices.
Should a public market develop for our stock, future sales 
of shares may negatively affect their market price.
Even if a market develops, the shares may be sparsely traded 
and have wide share price fluctuations. If we succeed in receiving a quotation, 
the liquidity of the stock may be low despite there being a market making it 
difficult to get a return on the investment. The price also depends on potential 
investors feelings regarding the results of our operations, the competition of 
other companies shares, mineral prices, our ability to generate future 
revenues, and market perception about future mineral exploration.
Because our stock is a penny stock, trading of it may be 
restricted and limit a shareholders ability to buy and sell shares.
As our stock is a penny stock, there are restrictions imposed 
by the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions penny stock 
regulations and the FINRAs sales practice requirements. This might limit a 
shareholders ability to buy and sell their shares as broker-dealers may be less 
likely to engage in transactions of our common shares. A penny stock generally 
includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than 
$5.00 per share. Our common stock is expected to trade well below that mark. 
Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 under the Exchange Act impose sale practice and 
disclosure requirements on certain brokers-dealers who engage in certain 
transactions involving a penny stock.


We have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends 
on our common stock.
Cash dividends are not currently paid on our common stock 
shares nor are they expected to be paid in the near future. We intend to retain 
our cash for the continued development of our business. Thus, you will not be 
able to derive any dividend income and your return on investment will solely be 
based on your ability to sell your shares in a secondary market.

Property Location and Description
Mitu Gold Claim project consists of one unpatented mineral 
claim, located in the department of Vaupes at UTM co-ordinates Latitude 1 
degrees 11' 53" North and Longitude 70 degrees 10' 23" West. The mineral claim 
was assigned to Mitu Resources Inc. by Alvarez Explorations Inc. and said 
assignment was filed with the Bogota Regional office of the Ministry of Mining 
of the Republic of Colombia. We own 100% of this claim with no encumbrance. The 
area of the claim is 92.5 hectares. 
There are no known environmental concerns or parks designated 
for any area contained within the claims. The property has no encumbrances. If 
advanced exploration proceeds, there may be bonding requirements for 
reclamation.
Except as described above, there are no material terms of the 
land or mineral rights securing agreements with respect to the MITU Gold 
Claim.
A mining license is necessary to mine the MITU Gold Claim. MITU 
obtained such a license, but it has expired. MITU plans to renew the license if 
and when it is ready to commence mining operations.
Maps of the MITU Gold claim are set forth below:

Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, 
and Topography
The MITU Gold Claim is located close to the Brazilian border in 
southeastern Colombia, in the north western part of the Department of Vaupes. It 
covers areas of historic placer and small scale bedrock gold mining. It is 
approximately 40 km west of the capital Mitu and approximately 102 km northwest 
of the small town of Taraira. Flying time from Bogota to Mitu, capital of Vaupes 
Department, is 1.35 hours.
The main routes of transportation and communication with the 
provinces and the municipalities of Caruru and Taraira are by air. The Vaupes 
River is the main waterway in the Department of Vaupes and its municipalities. 
Larger sailing vessels can navigate the upper portions of the river for seven 
months a year. A section of 54 km of road between Mitu and Monforth is passable 
as well as a network of 788 km of unpaved roads link the communities to each 
other.
Mitu is described as an area of transition between the dry 
plains of Orinoco and the Amazon rainforest with temperatures ranging from 24°C 
to 38°C (75.2 to 100.4 farenheit). There are dry and wet seasons with rainfalls 
ranging from 254 cm to 635 cm per year. Exploration work can be carried out 
unhampered throughout the year, although production may be slower during the 
months of April, May, and October when peak rains occur.
There is a heavy reliance on government expenditure in the form 
of government salaries and government subsidies to improve living conditions in 
the area. Other economic activities in the area consist of the collection of 
wild rubber and subsistence farming with the cultivation of yucca, pupuna, 
peppers, pineapple, sugar cane and onions. Mineral resources such as gold and 
ilmenite can be found as well as small percentage content of coltan 
tantalite.


Over 98% of the municipality is covered in tropical forests, 
which are part of the Forest Reserve of the Amazon so their uses are 
conditional. The main food crops are cassava, maize, coca, banana, sweet potato 
and yam cane. Various fruits are also grown in the region such as pineapple, 
papaya, watermelon, cocoa as well as numerous local wild fruits.
In Mitu, there is an airport named Alberto Leon Bentley which 
has been in operation since September 2002 with a runway length of 1850 meters 
long and 30 wide. The airport terminal, approximately 1620 meters square in 
size, handles all cargo (food, fuel, and other materials) to be distributed to 
interior areas in the Department of Vaupes. Freight companies operate regularly 
and air taxi carriers provide transport service between Mitu, the other 
municipalities of the department and rural indigenous communities.
A series of unpaved roads connects the town of Mitu to other 
communities in the interior of the department accessible by jeep. A 54 km of 
passable roadway links Mitu to the town of Monforth. There are numerous trails 
present and many of the local residents use canoes and waterways to travel 
between communities in the Amazon Basin 
History
Numerous showings of mineralization have been discovered in the 
area and six prospects have achieved significant production, with the nearby 
Lopez Gold Claim (25 kilometers away) producing 134,000 ounces of gold annually. 
Gold is reported to have also been discovered in Taraira, a municipal in the 
Department of Vaupes approximately 95 km southeast of Mitu, where several mining 
explorations are currently being conducted.
Geological setting
Regional Geology of the Area
The project lies within the northwestern edge of the Neblina 
successor foreland basin, a large Meso- to Paleo-Proterozoic basin, which 
overlaps the Paleo-Proterozoic Roraima foreland basin and encompasses a large 
area of Brazil, as well as areas of Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia.
Deposits within these basins were derived from the 
Trans-Amazonian mountain range and are dominantly mature deltaic and 
shallow-marine sandstones such as quartz arenite and arkosic sandstones. 
Sedimentary strata underlying the project area and gold mineralization are 
belong to a group of Roraima-like have been determined. Sedimentary outliers 
overlie Roraima Supergroup strata further west, for which zircon from tuffs 
within this Supergroup are from the Paleoproterozoic age. Basin deposits in the 
project area overlie the eastern Proterozoic Rio Negro Amazon craton formed 
mostly by collisional S- and I-type granitoids which were intruded into the 
basement. Roraima-like sequences including deposits were deformed during the 
Sunsas collision along the northwestern and southwestern margins of the Amazon 
craton. These deposits remained buried until Late Jurassic, when they were 
uplifted during the Takutu rift event which preceded the drift phase of Africa 
and North America.
The metasedimentary sequence is comprised predominantly of 
quartzarenite strata with minor mudstone and siltstone intercalations and 
metaconglomerate beds. This sequence is the primary host to gold mineralization 
in the region. Meta-sedimentary strata throughout the region have been folded 
into a sequence of northerly-trending anticlines and synclines. Outcrop patterns 
suggest poly-phase folding.
The MITU Gold Claim is the located on a bedrock of native gold 
occurrences and numerous relatively small alluvial gold deposits. Mineralization 
was discovered in the area in the early 1930s and since that time has been the 
site of multiple small-scale placer and hard-rock gold recovery operations by 
individual miners. These minor operations left no disturbance or contamination 
on the surface or in the groundwater, and so no remediation activities will be 
needed. Alluvial gold deposits appear to be widespread in the region and these 
types of deposits have been the main target of small-scale individual miners. 
Native gold is readily panned from the surrounding areas, generally in areas of 
minor excavations and mine workings and also from creeks. Grains of native gold 
up to 5mm in size have been observed in rock samples from the project.
In-situ primary gold mineralization in the district occurs 
along trending ridges of Precambrian sedimentary stratigraphy. Quartz arenite is 
the main lithological unit in this metasedimentary sequence and is also the 
primary host of gold. Minor native gold also occurs in metaconglomerate beds in 
the sedimentary sequence.


Primary gold mineralization identified to date in the district 
appears to be strongly controlled by stratigraphy, however, it is also 
associated with cross-cutting structures. Mineralization occurs as fine to 
coarse-grained native gold hosted by narrow cryptocrystalline quartz veins. Gold 
mineralization also occurs as possibly detrital grains along bedding planes and 
as very fine interstitial grains interpreted as paleoplacer mineralization.
Mineralization is most closely associated with silica 
alteration at all locations, occurring as minor zones of narrow quartz veining 
and/or as evidently more widely distributed zones of silicification in host 
strata. Native gold most commonly occurs in the absence of sulfides or other 
opaque minerals or in association with trace to minor amounts of pyrite and/or 
wolframite. The presence of organic matter within the sedimentary strata has 
also been suggested to be important to gold mineralization.
Historic reports and preliminary investigations suggest that 
the district has the potential to host paleoplacer or modified paleoplacer 
and/or epigenetic vein- and shear-related gold mineralization. A synsedimentary 
origin for gold mineralization in the district is consistent with apparent 
lithological and stratigraphic controls on mineralization and by the widespread 
distribution of gold mineralization in quartz arenite dominant strata. The 
tentative identification of rounded and irregular-shaped gold particles in 
quartz sandstone also supports a synsedimentary origin since these particles 
closely resemble paleoplacer "micronuggets", and do not appear to be related to 
veining. The apparent paucity of sulfides associated with gold mineralization 
and the absence of significant hydrothermal alteration could also be construed 
as supportive of a paleoplacer origin for stratabound mineralization.
The common occurrence of native gold in narrow quartz veins and 
along fractures, supports either an epigenetic or remobilized paleoplacer model. 
The close association between mineralization and silica, as silicification of 
quartz arenite strata and/or as narrow quartz veinlets and the apparent 
association between gold and elements such as bismuth and antimony may more 
readily conform with an epigenetic model.
Nevertheless, a possible Paleoproterozoic age for siliciclastic 
deposits and therefore also for inferred detrital gold mineralization do not 
preclude a paleoplacer origin for gold mineralization. It is hypothesized that 
where regional-scale tectonic processes favored their preservation, paleoplacer 
gold deposits, which is thought to have formed throughout earth's history, have 
survived. An increase in the distribution of orogenic gold deposits globally 
have provided a ready source of primary gold for redistribution in Late 
Paleoproterozoic placers.
Both epigenetic and syngenetic paleoplacer deposit types are 
being targeted in exploration programs with the possibility for paleoplacer or 
remobilized paleoplacer and structurally controlled and/or vein-hosted gold 
mineralization in the district, and considering the potential economic 
importance associated with these styles of mineralization.
Exploration
Records indicate that no detailed exploration has been 
completed on the property.
Drilling Summary
No drilling has occurred on the MITU Gold Claim. Since 2000, 
several properties east of Mitu Gold Claim have been drilled by junior mineral 
exploration companies.
Sampling Method, Sample Preparation, 
Data Verification
All the exploration will be conducted according to generally 
accepted exploration procedures with methods and preparation that are consistent 
with generally accepted exploration practices. No samples have been taken.
No other procedures of quality control will be employed and no 
opinion on their absence is expressed.
Report Recommendations
A two phased exploration program to further delineate the 
mineralized system currently recognized on MITU Gold Claim is recommended.
The program would consist of air photo interpretation of the 
structures, geological mapping, both regionally and detailed on the area of the 
main showings, geophysical survey using both magnetic and electromagnetic 
instrumentation in detail over the area of the showings and in a regional 
reconnaissance survey and geochemical soil sample surveying regionally to 
identify other areas on the claim that are mineralized and in detail on the 
known areas of mineralization. The effort of this exploration work is to define 
and enable interpretation of a follow-up diamond drill program, so that the 
known mineralization and the whole property can be thoroughly evaluated with the 
most up to date exploration techniques.

      in those rocks. 

 

 

Assaying 

laboratory examination that determines the content or 
      proportion of a specific metal contained within a sample. 

 

 

Auriferous 

refers to gold (AU) or gold equivalents (AUEQ). 


 

 

Basalt 

a hard rock of varied mineral content; volcanic in 
      origin, it makes up much of the Earth's crust 

 

 

Bauxite 

the principal ore of aluminium; a clay-like mineral, 
      being a mixture of hydrated oxides and hydroxides. 

 

 

Caldera 

a large circular volcanic depression often originating 
      due to collapse 

 

 

Charnockites 

any orthopyroxene-bearing granite, composed mainly of 
      quartz, perthite or antiperthite and orthopyroxene (usually hypersthene), 
      as an end-member of the charnockite series. 




Chert 

massive, dull-colored and opaque quartzite, hornstone, 
      impure chalcedony or other flint-like mineral. By general usage in 
      mineralogy and geology, a chert does not have a conchoidal fracture. In 
      North American archeology the term chert occasionally is still used for 
      various siliceous minerals (including flint) that have a conchoidal 
      fracture; this leads to confusion between the terms flint and chert in 
      some archeology texts. 

  



Clay 

a mineral substance made up of small crystals of silica 
      and alumina, that is ductile when moist; the material of pre-fired 
      ceramics; an earth material with ductile qualities 

  



Clinopyroxene 

any pyroxene that has a monoclinic crystal structure 
    

  



Coal 

a readily combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary 
      rock normally occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal 
      beds. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as 
      metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and 
      pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon along with variable 
      quantities of other elements, chiefly sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen and 
      nitrogen. 

  



Copper 

a chemical element with the symbol Cu (Latin: cuprum) and 
      atomic number 29. It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and 
      electrical conductivity. Pure copper is rather soft and malleable, and a 
      freshly- exposed surface has a pinkish or peachy color. 

  



Cretaceous age 

a geological period and system from 145 to 65 million 
      years ago.

      spatial dimensions; ie. crystals. 

  



Dolerite 

A fine-grained basaltic rock 

  



Dynamothermal 

rock formed at variable temperatures 

  



Extrusive 

the mode of igneous volcanic rock formation in which hot 
      magma from inside the Earth flows out (extrudes) onto the surface as lava 
      or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or 
      tuff. This is opposed to intrusive rock formation, in which magma does not 
      reach the surface. The main effect of extrusion is that the magma can cool 
      much more quickly in the open air or under seawater, and there is little 
      time for the growth of crystals. Often, a residual portion of the matrix 
      fails to crystallize at all, instead becoming an interstitial natural 
      glass or obsidian. 

  



Fault 

a break in the continuity of a body of rock. It is 
      accompanied by a movement on one side of the break or the other so that 
      what were once parts of one continuous rock stratum or vein are now 
      separated. The amount of displacement of the parts may range from a few 
      inches to thousands of feet. 

  



Feldspar 

any of a large group of rock-forming minerals that, 
      together, make up about 60% of the earth's outer crust. The feldspars are 
      all aluminum silicates of the alkali metals sodium, potassium, calcium and 
      barium. Feldspars are the principal constituents of igneous and plutonic 
      rocks. 

  



Flatmake 

flat-dipping fractures 

  



Fold 

a curve or bend of a planar structure such as rock stata, 
      bedding planes, foliation, or cleavage. 

  



Foliation 

A general term for a planar arrangement of textural or 
      structural features in any type of rock; esp., the planar structure that 
      results from flattening of the constituent grains of a metamorphic rock. 
      

  



Formation 

a distinct layer of sedimentary rock of similar 
      composition. 

  



Gabbro 

a group of dark-colored, basic intrusive igneous rocks 
      composed principally of basic plagioclase (commonly labradorite or 
      bytownite) and clinopyroxene (augite), with or without olivine and 
      orthopyroxene; also, any member of that group. It is the approximate 
      intrusive equivalent of basalt. Apatite and magnetite or ilmenite are 
      common accessory minerals. 

  



Geochemistry 

the study of the distribution and amounts of the chemical 
      elements in minerals, ores, rocks, solids, water, and the atmosphere. 
    




Geophysicist 

one who studies the earth; in particular the physics of 
      the solid earth, the earths magnetosphere, and the atmosphere. 

  

 

Geotechnical 

the study of ground stability 

  

 

Gneiss 

a foliated rock formed by regional metamorphism, in which 
      bands or lens-shaped strata or bodies of rock of granular minerals 
      alternate with bands or lens-shaped strata or bodies or rock in which 
      minerals having flaky or elongate prismatic habits predominate 

  

 

Gold 

chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum, 
      "shining dawn") and an atomic number of 79. It has been a highly 
      sought-after precious metal for coinage, jewelry, and other arts since the 
      beginning of recorded history. The metal occurs as nuggets or grains in 
      rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. Gold is dense, soft, shiny and 
      the most malleable and ductile pure metal known. Pure gold has a bright 
      yellow color and luster traditionally considered attractive, which it 
      maintains without oxidizing in air or water. Gold is one of the coinage 
      metals and has served as a symbol of wealth and a store of value 
      throughout history. Gold standards have provided a basis for monetary 
      policies. It also has been linked to a variety of symbolisms and 
      ideologies. 

  

 

Granite 

highly felsic igneous plutonic rock, typically light in 
      color; rough plutonic equivalent of rhyolite. Granite is actually quite 
      rare in the U.S.; often the term is applied to any quartz-bearing plutonic 
      rock. 

  

 

Granodiorite 

a group of coarse-grained plutonic rocks intermediate in 
      composition between quartz diorite and quartz monzonite, and potassium 
      feldspar, with biotite, hornblende, or more rarely, pyroxene, as the mafic 
      component. 

  

 

Granulite 

fine to mediumgrained metamorphic rocks that have 
      experienced high temperatures of metamorphism, composed mainly of 
      feldspars sometimes associated with quartz and anhydrous ferromagnesian 
      minerals, with granoblastic texture and gneissose to massive structure. 
      They are of particular interest to geologists because many granulites 
      represent samples of the deep continental crust. Some granulites 
      experienced decompression from deep in the Earth to shallower crustal 
      levels at high temperature; others cooled while remaining at depth in the 
      Earth. 

  

 

Graphite 

one of the allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond (another 
      carbon allotrope), graphite is an electrical conductor, a semimetal, and 
      can be used, for instance, in the electrodes of an arc lamp. Graphite 
      holds the distinction of being the most stable form of carbon under 
      standard conditions. 

  

 

Gypsum 

a mineral consisting of the hydrated calcium sulphate. 
      When calcined, it forms plaster of Paris. 

  

 



Heavy mineral sands ore deposits a class of ore deposit 
      which is an important source of zirconium, titanium, thorium, tungsten, 
      rare earth elements, the industrial minerals diamond, sapphire, garnet, 
      and occasionally precious metals or gemstones. Heavy mineral sands are 
      placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration 
      due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains. It is equally likely 
      that some concentrations of heavy minerals (aside from the usual gold 
      placers) exist within streambeds, but most are of a low grade and are 
      relatively small. 

  

 

Hydrothermal 

creation of rock with fluid at high temperatures 
  

  

 

Igneous 

resulting from, or produced by, the action of great heat; 
      with rocks, it could also mean formed from lava/magma; granite and basalt 
      are igneous rocks 

  

 

Intrusions 

masses of igneous rock that, while molten, were forced 
      into other rocks. 

  

 

Iron 

chemical element with the symbol Fe (Latin: ferrum) and 
      atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. Like other 
      group 8 elements, it exists in a wide range of oxidation states. Iron and 
      iron alloys (steels) are by far the most common metals and the most common 
      ferromagnetic materials in everyday use. Fresh iron surfaces appear 
      lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in air. Iron is the most common element 
      in the earth, albeit the fourth most common one in the earth's crust. 
    

  

 

Khondalite 

a granulite-facies metasedimentary rock. 
  




Laterite 

a red hard or gravel-like soil or subsoil formed in the 
      tropics that has been leached of soluble minerals leaving insoluble iron 
      and aluminium oxides and hydroxides; used to make bricks and roads. 
  

  

 

Leptynite 

a granulite. 

  

 

Lignite 

a low-grade, brownish-black coal 

  

 

Limestone 

An abundant rock of marine and fresh-water sediments; 
      primarily composed of calcite (calcium carbonate); it occurs in a variety 
      of forms, both crystalline and amorphous. 

  

 

Marble 

a non foliated metamorphic rock composed mostly of 
      calcite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate. It is formed from 
      carbonate rocks, often limestone. It is extensively used for sculpture and 
      as a building material. 

  

 

Magnetite 

a ferrimagnetic mineral with chemical formula Fe 3 
      O 4 , one of several iron oxides and a member of the 
      spinel group. 

  

 

Metamorphic 

the mineralogical, chemical, and structural adjustment of 
      solid rocks to physical and chemical conditions that have generally been 
      imposed at depth below the surface zones of weathering and cementation, 
      and that differ from the conditions under which the rocks in question 
      originated. 

  

 

Metasediment 

a metamorphosed sedimentary rock 

  

 

  

 

Mica 

the name of a group of hydrous aluminosilicate minerals 
      characterized by highly perfect cleavage, so that they readily separate 
      into very thin leaves, more or less elastic. 

  

 

Monzonite 

an intermediate igneous intrusive rock composed of 
      approximately equal amounts of sodic to intermediate plagioclase and 
      orthoclase feldspars with minor amounts of hornblende, biotite and other 
      minerals. 

  

 

Ore 

the natural occurring mineral from which a mineral or 
      minerals of economic value can be extracted profitable or to satisfy 
      social or political objectives. 

  

 

Oxides 

a chemical compound containing at least one oxygen atom 
      as well as at least one other element. Most of the Earth's crust consists 
      of oxides. Oxides result when elements are oxidized by oxygen in air. 
    

  

 

Paragneisses 

a gneiss from sedimentary rock 

  

 

Peat 

an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. 
      Peat forms in wetland bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosins, mires, and peat 
      swamp forests. Peat is harvested as an important source of fuel in certain 
      parts of the world. 

  

 

Pegmatite 

a very coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock composed of 
      interlocking grains usually larger than 2.5 cm in size; such rocks are 
      referred to as pegmatitic. Most pegmatites are composed of quartz, 
      feldspar and mica; in essence a granite. Rarer intermediate composition 
      and mafic pegmatites containing amphibole, Ca- plagioclase feldspar, 
      pyroxene and other minerals are known, found in recrystallised zones and 
      apophyses associated with large layered intrusions. 

  

 

Phosphatic nodules 

black to brown, rounded mass, variable in size from a few 
      millimeters to 30 or more centimeters. Usually consists of coprolites, 
      corals, shells, and bones, more or less enveloped in crusts of collophane. 
      Found in many horizons of marine origin. Also covering the ocean floors at 
      many locations around the world. 

  

 

Placers 

an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by deposition 
      of dense mineral phases in a trap site. 

  

 

Precious metals 

a rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical element of 
      high economic value, which is not radioactive (excluding natural polonium, 
      radium, actinium and protactinium). Chemically, the precious metals are 
      less reactive than most elements, have high lustre, are softer or more 
      ductile, and have higher melting points than other metals. Historically, 
      precious metals were important as currency, but are now regarded mainly as 
      investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum, and 
      palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code. 





Production 

a production stage project is actively engaged in the 
      process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a 
      marketable metal or mineral product. 

  

 

Pyrite 

a yellow iron sulphide mineral of little value and 
      referred to as fools gold. 

  

 

Pyrrhotite 

a bronze-colored, magnetic iron sulphide mineral 
  

  

 

Quartz 

a common rock-forming mineral consisting of silicon and 
      oxygen 

  

 

Quartzite 

a hard metamorphic rock which was originally sandstone. 
      Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually 
      related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. Pure quartzite is 
      usually white to grey, though quartzites often occur in various shades of 
      pink and red due to varying amounts of iron oxide. Other colors, such as 
      yellow and orange, are due to other mineral impurities. 

  

 

Reserve 

the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral 
      deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at 
      the time of the reserve determination. Reserves must be supported by a 
      feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the 
      economic extraction. (Bankable standards implies that the confidence 
      attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is 
      sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing.) A 
      reserve includes adjustments to the in-situ tons and grade to include 
      diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the 
      material is mined. 

  

 

Schist 

any crystalline rock having a foliated structure and 
      hence admitting of ready division into slabs or slates. 

  

 

Seismic 

referring to earthquakes 

  

 

Shear 

a form of strain resulting from stresses that cause or 
      tend to cause contiguous parts of a body of rock to slide relatively to 
      each other in a direction parallel to their plane of contact. 

  

 

Silica 

the chemical compound silicon dioxide, also known as 
      silica (from the Latin silex), is an oxide of silicon with a chemical 
      formula of SiO 2 and has been known for its hardness since 
      antiquity. Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as 
      well as in the cell walls of diatoms. Silica is the most abundant mineral 
      in the Earth's crust. 

  

 

Stockwork 

a complex system of structurally controlled or randomly 
      oriented veins. Stockworks are common in many ore deposit types and 
      especially notable in greisens. They are also referred to as stringer 
      zones. 

  

 

Stratum 

one of several parallel horizontal layers of material 
      arranged one on top of another. A layer of sedimentary rock having 
      approximately the same composition throughout 

  

 

Sulphides 

an anion of sulfur in its lowest oxidation number of −2. 
      Sulfide is also a slightly archaic term for thioethers, a common type of 
      organosulfur compound that are well known for their bad odors. 

  

 

Telluride 

a compound of a metal with tellurium; metal salts of 
      tellurane. Any organic compound of general formula R 2 Te (R 
      not = H), the tellurium analogues of ethers. Another name for sylvanite. 
      

  

 

Tonalite 

an igneous, plutonic (intrusive) rock, of felsic 
      composition, with phaneritic texture. Feldspar is present as plagioclase 
      (typically oligoclase or andesine) with 10% or less alkali feldspar. 
      Quartz is present as more than 20% of the rock. Amphiboles and pyroxenes 
      are common accessory minerals. 

  

 

UTM 

the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system 
      is a grid-based method of specifying locations on the surface of the Earth 
      that is a practical application of a 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate 
      system. It is used to identify locations on the earth, but differs from 
      the traditional method of latitude and longitude in several respects. The 
      UTM system is not a single map projection. The system instead employs a 
      series of sixty zones, each of which is based on a specifically defined 
      secant transverse Mercator projection. 

  

 

Vein 

a thin, sheet-like body of hydrothermal mineralization, 
      principally quartz. 

  

 

Wall Rock 

the rock adjacent to a vein. 




Wollastonite 

a calcium inosilicate mineral (CaSiO 3 ) that 
      may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting 
      for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or 
      dolostone is subjected to high temperature and pressure sometimes in the 
      presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or contact metamorphic 
      rocks. Associated minerals include garnets, vesuvianite, diopside, 
      tremolite, epidote, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene and calcite. It is 
      named after the English chemist and mineralogist William Hyde Wollaston 
      (17661828).

Item 7. 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
      Financial Condition and Results of Operation 
This discussion should be considered in conjunction with 
audited financial statements of the company and forward-looking statements 
contained here apply from this date and involve some risks and uncertainties. We 
are a start-up, exploration stage company. We have a limited operating history 
and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our activities. We have 
yet to undertake any exploration activity on our sole property - the MITU Gold 
Claim. As our property is in the early stage of exploration and there is no 
reasonable likelihood that revenue can be derived from the property in the 
foreseeable future. Our plan is to explore the MITU Gold Claim for gold; we want 
to proceed but lack sufficient cash to do so. The two phase exploration program 
will cost $6,712 (COP 12,650,840) for Phase I and $13,000 (COP 24,500,000) for 
Phase II. Thus, the anticipated company expenses over the next year are roughly 
$19,712 in exploration alone if Phase I and Phase II are undertaken. We also 
anticipate an additional $49,337 for expenses including professional legal and 
accounting services required after becoming a reporting company. No revenues 
have yet been earned. We do not anticipate revenues until a commercially 
profitable product can be extracted and sold. As exploration has not yet 
commenced, we remain uncertain as to whether we will ever discover profitable 
amounts of mineral and what the market will be for it when and if we do produce 
some. If conditions are favorable, then upon discovery we will enter into 
production. If we do not proceed then we will try to acquire an interest in 
another mineral claim. Should we not have sufficient funds to purchase another 
mineral claim outright then we may have to make a share offering to obtain an 
option on a property. If that succeeds then again we would try to explore with 
money raised by offering our stock, engaging in borrowing, or locating a joint 
venture partner. We have not generated any revenues, and no revenues are 
anticipated until we begin removing and selling minerals, if ever. Accordingly, 
we must raise cash from sources other than the sale of gold found on the MITU 
Gold Claim.
To implement further exploration work on the MITU Gold Claim 
and to stay in business, we must raise additional cash  particularly over the 
next 12 months. If we cannot raise additional funds we will not have sufficient 
funds to satisfy our cash requirements and would have to go out of business. 
Since our business activity is related solely to the exploration and evaluation 
of the MITU Gold Claim, it is the opinion of management that the most meaningful 
financial information relates primarily to current liquidity and solvency. As at 
March 31, 2015, we had $19,711 in working capital deficit. Our future financial 
success will depend upon the success of the exploration work on the MITU Gold 
Claim. Such exploration may take years to complete and future cash flows, if 
any, are impossible to predict at this time. The realization value from any 
mineralization which may be discovered by us is largely dependent on factors 
beyond our control, such as the market value of metals produced, mining 
regulations in Columbia and foreign exchange rates.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception to the present, we have raised capital through 
private placements of common stock aggregating $30,000 with our only two 
shareholders and officers. As at March 31, 2015, we had $6,184 in cash.
Our capital commitments for the coming 12 months consist of 
administrative expenses together with expenses associated with the completion of 
our planned exploration program. Including this exploration work, we estimate 
that we will have to incur the following expenses during the next 12 months:

In the future, the Company may be forced to rely upon cash 
advances from its officers to meet current and future liabilities.
We have no plant or significant equipment to sell, nor are we 
going to buy any plant or significant equipment during the next 12 months. We 
will not buy any equipment unless we locate a body of ore and determine that it 
is economical to extract the ore from the land. We may attempt to interest other 
companies to undertake exploration work on the MITU Gold Claim through joint 
venture arrangement or even the sale of part of the MITU Gold Claim. Neither of 
these avenues has been pursued as of the date of this prospectus. Our geologist 
has recommended an exploration program for the MITU Gold Claim. However, even if 
the results of this work suggest further exploration work is warranted, we do 
not presently have the requisite funds and so will be unable to complete 
anything beyond the exploration work on Phase I recommended in the Report until 
we raise more money or find a joint venture partner to complete the exploration 
work. If we cannot find a joint venture partner and do not raise more money, we 
will be unable to complete any work beyond the exploration program recommended 
by our geologist. If we are unable to finance additional exploration activities, 
we do not know what we will do and we do not have any plans to do anything else. 
We do not intend to hire any employees at this time. All of the work on the MITU 
Gold Claim will be conducted by our two officers. They will be responsible for 
supervision, surveying, exploration, and excavation and will be capable of 
evaluating the information derived from the exploration and excavation including 
advising MITU on the economic feasibility of removing any mineralized material 
we may discover. Of all the possibilities of financing to meet current and 
future liabilities, the most likely is cash advances from our officers. However, 
we have no agreements with our officers for them to make such advances, and they 
have no obligation to do so.
The Company can operate for at least six months with its 
current cash balance.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon 
which to base an evaluation of our performance as an exploration corporation. We 
are a exploration stage company and have not generated any revenues from our 
exploration activities. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our 
exploration activities. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the 
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, 
possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns 
due to price and cost increases in services.




To become profitable and competitive, we must invest in the exploration of our property before we start production of any minerals we may find. We must obtain equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to fully implement our phased 
exploration program. We have no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to commence, continue, develop or expand our exploration activities. Even if 
available, equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.

Results of Operations 

During the year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $31,472 comprised of $26,200 of professional fees related to our accounting, audit, and legal fees incurred as part of our SEC registration and filing requirements. We also 
incurred $5,272 of general and administrative costs from transfer agent fees. This compared to a net loss of $13,239 during the period from April 17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2014 for which we incurred $12,500 in 
professional fees and $739 in transfer agent fees. The overall increase is due to the fact that we incorporated a full year of operations in fiscal 2015 and the fact that we incurred a majority of SEC filing costs during the current fiscal 
period. 

For the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period from April 17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2014, we had a loss per share of $nil.

Our Planned Exploration Program

We must conduct exploration to determine what, if any, amounts of minerals exist on the MITU Gold Claim and if such minerals can be economically extracted and profitably processed.

Our planned exploration program is designed to explore and evaluate our property efficiently.

Our anticipated exploration costs for Phase I work on the MITU Gold Claim are approximately $6,712. This figure represents the anticipated cost to us of completing only Phase I work recommended by the Report. However, should the results of this 
work be sufficiently encouraging to justify our undertaking Phase II work recommended in the Report at an estimated cost of $13,000, we will have to raise additional investment capital. Regardless, we will have to raise additional funds within 
the next 12 months in order to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements and finance anything beyond Phase I work on the MITU Gold Claim.

Balance Sheet

As at March 31, 2015, we had cash of $6,184 and total assets of $11,184 compared to cash of $21,761 and total assets of $26,761 as at March 31, 2014. The decrease in cash and total assets was attributed to the use of cash for 
operating expenses during the year, as the Company had more operating expenses and raised less money from financing activities compared to prior year.

We had liabilities of $25,895 at March 31, 2015 compared to $10,000 at March 31, 2014. The increase in liabilities is due to $20,000 of debt owing to the President and Director of the Company for financing of our day-to-day operations. 
The amount owing is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. The increase is offset by a decrease of $4,105 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as we repaid outstanding obligations as they became due.

During the year ended March 31, 2015, we did not have any capital transactions.

Cash Flows 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

During the year ended March 31, 2015, we used $35,577 of cash in operating activities compared to $3,239 during the period from April 17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities 
was attributed to an increase in overall operating activities during the year, including professional fees for accounting, audit, and legal fees.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 


During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company has not had 
any investing activities. From April 17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 
2014, the Company acquired mineral property of $5,000. 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
During the year ended March 31, 2015, we received $20,000 from 
our President and Director for funding of our day-to-day operations, and the 
amounts owing are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. During the 
period from April 17, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2014, we received 
$30,000 from the issuance of 30,000,000 common shares.
Trends
We are in the exploration stage, have not generated any revenue 
and have no prospects of generating any revenue in the foreseeable future. We 
are unaware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are 
reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our business or income, either 
in the long term of short term, other than as described in this section or in 
Risk Factors, page 14.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and 
results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital 
resources, are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an 
ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments.
The going concern basis of presentation assumes we will 
continue in operation throughout the next fiscal year and into the foreseeable 
future and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and 
commitments in the normal course of business. Certain conditions, discussed 
below, are currently present that raise substantial doubt upon the validity of 
this assumption. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that 
might result from the outcome of the uncertainty.
Our intended exploration activities depend upon our ability to 
obtain financing in the form of debt and equity and ultimately to generate 
future profitable exploration activity or income from its investments. As of the 
date hereof we have not generated revenues, and have experienced negative cash 
flow from minimal exploration activities. We may look to secure additional funds 
through future debt or equity financings. Such financings may not be available 
or may not be available on reasonable terms.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
      Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Mitu Resources, 
Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Mitu 
Resources, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related 
statements of operation, changes in shareholders equity and cash flow for the 
year ended March 31, 2015 and the period from April 17, 2013 (inception) to 
March 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well 
as evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. We believe that our 
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mitu 
Resources, Inc. as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the result of its operation 
and its cash flow for the year ended March 31, 2015 and the period from April 
17, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.
The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the 
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the 
financial statements, the Companys losses from operations raise substantial 
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements 
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this 
uncertainty.

Mitu Resources Inc. Notes to the Financial 
Statements (Expressed in U.S. dollars) 


1. 

Nature of Operations and Continuance of 
      Business
Mitu Resources Inc. (the Company) was 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2013 and is a mineral 
exploration and production company engaged in the exploration, acquisition, and 
development of mineral properties. The Company holds nine claims in the Mitu 
Gold Mine in Departamento del Vaupes, Colombia and is in the process of 
exploring these claims, as well as raising additional capital for future 
acquisitions.
Going Concern 
These financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue 
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of 
business. The Company has generated no revenues to date, and has an accumulated 
deficit of $44,711. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is 
dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the 
ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable 
operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial 
doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These 
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and 
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that 
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going 
concern.
The Companys plan of action over the 
next twelve months is to raise capital financing to conduct exploration and 
drilling on its mineral property claims held in Departamento del Vaupes, 
Colombia as well as exploring for new mineral property claims. 


2. 

Summary of Significant Accounting 
  Policies


 
a) 

Basis of Presentation
These financial statements and related 
notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States (US GAAP), and are expressed in US dollars. The Companys 
fiscal year-end is March 31.


 
b) 

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company 
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of 
mineral properties, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The 
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical 
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and 
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results 
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the 
Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the 
estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 



 
c) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly 
liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance 
to be cash equivalents. As at March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no cash 
equivalents. 


 
d) 

Mineral Property Costs
The Company has been in the 
exploration stage since its formation on April 17, 2013 and has not yet realized 
any revenues from its planned operations. Mineral property acquisition costs are 
capitalized as incurred. Exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as 
incurred until proven and probable reserves are established. The Company 
assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and 
Equipment at each fiscal quarter end. When it has been determined that a 
mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing 
proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, 
are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production 
method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. If mineral properties 
are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to 
operations. 


 
e) 

Asset Retirement Obligations
As at March 31, 2015 and 2014, the 
Company has no asset retirement obligations.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
      (continued)


 
f) 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per 
Share
The Company computes net income (loss) 
per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 
requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on 
the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income 
(loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives 
effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period 
using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the 
if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the 
period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from 
the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive 
potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive. 


 
g) 

Income Taxes
Potential benefits of income tax 
losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than 
not. The Company has adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as of 
its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset 
benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net 
operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because 
the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net 
operating losses carried forward in future years.


 
h) 

Comprehensive Loss
ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, 
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and 
its components in the financial statements. As at March 31, 2015 and 2014, the 
Company has no items that represent comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not 
included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. 


 
i) 

Financial Instruments
Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value 
Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an 
entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use 
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair 
value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence 
surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments 
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the 
inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
Level 1 
Level 1 applies to assets or 
liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 
Level 2 applies to assets or 
liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are 
observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets 
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or 
liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less 
active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are 
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable 
market data. 
Level 3 
Level 3 applies to assets or 
liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology 
that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or 
liabilities. 
The Companys financial instruments 
consist principally of cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
Pursuant to ASC, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents is determined based 
on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other 
financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their 
nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 


 
j) 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has limited operations and 
is considered to be in the exploration stage. During the period ended September 
30, 2014, the Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 
2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain 
Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to 
remove the inception to date information and all references to exploration 
stage.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
      (continued)


 
j) 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new 
accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have 
any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and 
the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting 
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its 
financial position or results of operations. 


3. 

Mineral Property
On April 17, 2013, the Company 
acquired nine claims in the Mitu Gold Mines, located in Colombia, for 
$5,000.
A mining license is necessary to mine the MITU Gold Claim.  MITU obtained such a license, but it has expired.  MITU plans to renew the license if and when it is ready to commence mining operations. 


4. 

Common Shares
On April 17, 2013, the Company issued 
30,000,000 common shares to founders of the Company at $0.001 per share for 
proceeds of $30,000. 


5. 

Income Taxes
The Company has $44,711 of net 
operating losses carried forward to offset taxable income in future years which 
expire commencing in fiscal 2034. The income tax benefit differs from the amount 
computed by applying the US federal income tax rate of 34% to net loss before 
income taxes. As at March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no uncertain tax 
positions.

any material recognizable subsequent events after March 31, 2015, with the 
exception of the following: 


 
(a) 

On April 23, 2014, the Company issued a $10,000 
      promissory note to the President and Director of the Company. The note is 
      unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on 
demand.

Item 9A. 
Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     As of the end of the period 
covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and 
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of 
our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, both the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure 
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were effective as of March 31, 2015. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting 
     Our Management is responsible for 
establishing adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as that term 
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision 
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 
2015 based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls 
over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2015, and that there was 
no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal controls 
during the year ended on that date. 
This annual report does not include a report of managements 
assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation 
report of the companys registered public accounting firm due to a transition 
period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly 
public companies

PART III 


Item 10. 
Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate 
      Governance 
Directors and Officers 
Our bylaws state that our authorized number of directors shall 
be not less than one and shall be set by resolution of our Board of Directors. 
Our Board of Directors has fixed the number of directors at one, and we 
currently have only one director.
Our current director and officers are as follows:


          
                          
               Name 
Age 
Position 


 
 
 

Juan Perez 
59 
President and Director 

 
 
 

Nelson Rincon 
43 
Secretary and Treasurer 
  
Our director will serve in that capacity until our next annual 
shareholder meeting or until his successor is elected and qualified. Officers 
hold their positions at the will of our Board of Directors. There are no 
arrangements, agreements or understandings between non-management security 
holders and management under which non-management security holders may directly 
or indirectly participate in or influence the management of our affairs.
Juan Perez, 59, Director and President 
Mr. Perez is a citizen of the Republic of Colombia. He 
graduated from Colegio El Rosario Montelibano Cordoba in 1977 and holds an ARC 
GIS for Geology and Mining advanced level II George Bruce Montelibano Cordoba 
2002. From May 2007 to the present, he has been operations supervisor for 
Ashmont Resources Corp, where he supervised exploration work, geophysics, 
geochemistry and drilling. Mr. Perez has supervised the exploration and 
exploitation of two gold mines in Colombia Mr. Perez's extensive background in 
the mining industry led us to conclude that he should serve as our Director. Mr. 
Barrios has been Director and President of our company since its inception on 
December 11, 2012.
Nelson Rincon , 43, Secretary and Treasurer 
Nelson Rincon Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Rincon is a citizen 
of the Republic of Colombia. He received a Bachelors of Commerce in Business 
Administration and Accounting degree in 1992 and a Masters in Business 
Administration in 1994, both from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, 
Colombia. Since January 2005, Mr. Rincon has been a senior accountant with 
Santos Financial Services, Bogota, Colombia, where he advises clients as to tax 
and finance strategies, prepares financial statements and assists with audits. 

From inception of the Company until May 26, 2014, the Companys 
Secretary and Treasurer was Denise Kovalski. She was replaced by Mr. Rincon, who 
became Secretary and Treasurer on May 26, 2014, and sold all her stock in the 
Company to him on that date. Mr. Perez has been President and Director since 
inception of the Company. Mr. Rincon has been Secretary and Treasurer since May 
26, 2014.
Currently neither Mr. Perez nor Mr. Rincon is a director or 
executive officer of any other mining companies. There is no guarantee that this 
wont change in the future and may present a conflict of interest. A Code of 
Ethics has been adopted to ensure responsible conduct to its customers, 
employees, lenders, shareholders and other stakeholders.
F-10 


Other than Mr. Rincon and Mr. Perez, we have no other employees 
at this time. Mr. Rincon and Mr. Perez are not paid employees. Our Officers and 
Director fulfill many functions that would otherwise require MITU to hire 
employees or outside consultants. Mr. Rincon and Mr. Perez each work full time 
at other jobs. Each devotes approximately 10 hours of professional time to MITU 
matters each month.
Other Directorships 
Our director holds no other directorships in any company with a 
class of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the Exchange Act or 
subject to the requirements of section 15(d) of such Act or any company 
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 
1940.
Board of Directors and Director Nominees 
Since our Board of Directors does not include a majority of 
independent directors, the decisions of the Board regarding director nominees 
are made by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. 
The Board will consider candidates for directors proposed by security holders, 
although no formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. 
Unless otherwise determined, at any time not less than 90 days prior to the next 
annual Board meeting at which the slate of director nominees is adopted, the 
Board will accept written submissions from proposed nominees that include the 
name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee; a brief statement of 
the nominees qualifications to serve as a director; and a statement as to why 
the security holder submitting the proposed nominee believes that the nomination 
would be in the best interests of our security holders. If the proposed nominee 
is not the same person as the security holder submitting the name of the 
nominee, a letter from the nominee agreeing to the submission of his or her name 
for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter 
should be accompanied by a résumé supporting the nominees qualifications to 
serve on the Board, as well as a list of references. 
The Board identifies director nominees through a combination of 
referrals from different people, including management, existing Board members 
and security holders. Once a candidate has been identified, the Board reviews 
the individuals experience and background and may discuss the proposed nominee 
with the source of the recommendation. If the Board believes it to be 
appropriate, Board members may meet with the proposed nominee before making a 
final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of the 
slate of director nominees submitted to security holders for election to the 
Board.
Some of the factors which the Board considers when evaluating 
proposed nominees include their knowledge of and experience in business matters, 
finance, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The Board may request 
additional information from each candidate prior to reaching a determination. 
The Board is under no obligation to formally respond to all recommendations, 
although as a matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so.
Conflicts of Interest 
Our directors and officers are not obligated to commit their 
full time and attention to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter a 
conflict of interest in allocating their time between our future operations and 
those of other businesses. In the course of their other business activities, 
they may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be 
appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a 
fiduciary duty. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining 
to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. They may 
also in the future become affiliated with entities, engaged in business 
activities similar to those we intend to conduct.
In general, officers and directors of a corporation are 
required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:


 
 
the corporation could financially undertake the 
      opportunity; 

 
 
the opportunity is within the corporations 
      line of business; and 


 
it would be unfair to the corporation and its 
      stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the 
      corporation. 
Our code of ethics obligates our directors, officers and 
employees to disclose potential conflicts of interest and prohibits those 
persons from engaging in such transactions without our consent.

individuals to make a significant contribution to our business.

No such plans or options exist. None have been approved or are 
anticipated. No Compensation Committee exists either.
Compensation of Directors 
We have no formal plan for compensating our directors for their

are expected in the future to receive options to purchase shares of our common 
stock as awarded by our Board of Directors or by any compensation committee that 
may be established. 
Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans 
There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, 
retirement or similar benefits to our directors or executive officers. We have

Under Rule 13-d of the Exchange Act, shares not 
      outstanding but subject to options, warrants, rights, conversion 
      privileges pursuant to which such shares may be acquired in the next 60 
      days are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the 
      percentage of outstanding shares owned by the person having such rights, 
      but are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage 
      for such other persons. None of our officers or director has options, 
      warrants, rights or conversion privileges 
outstanding.
We have no knowledge of any arrangements, including any pledge 
by any person of our securities, the future operation of which may at a 
subsequent date result in a change in our control.
We are not, to the best of our knowledge, directly or 
indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or foreign government.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Relationships 
F-14 


Our executive officers are not related. 
Transactions with related persons, promoters and certain 
control persons 
To this date, and aside from the following completed 
transactions, there have been no agreements or transactions with the 
director/officers, nominees for election as directors, any principal security 
holders, or any relative or spouse of such named persons. There have been no 
transactions, or proposed transactions, which have materially affected or will 
materially affect us in which any director, executive officer, or beneficial 
holder of more than 10% of the outstanding common stock, or any of their 
respective relatives, spouses, associates or affiliates has had or will have any 
direct or material indirect interest, except as follows:
The Company issued an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares to Mr. 
Perez, director and president, and Mr. Rincon, secretary and treasurer, at the 
price of $0.001 per share, for an aggregate consideration of $30,000. 
Subsequently, they sold an aggregate of 15,000,000 to persons unrelated to the 
Company. 
The shares issued to the officers were in consideration of 
their agreeing to take the initiative in developing and implementing the 
business plan of our company, including, among other things, providing the 
initial seed capital to allow our company to engage a professional geologist to 
assist in identifying a mineral prospect considered worthy of exploration thus 
enabling our company to implement its business plan
No transactions between the Selling Security Holders are known 
to have occurred.
Corporate Governance 
Director Independence 
We have determined that we do not have a director that would 
qualify as an independent director as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 
4200(a)(15). 
We do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating 
committee, but our entire Board of Directors acts in such capacities. We believe 
that our Board of Directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial 
statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial 
reporting. The Board of Directors of our company does not believe that it is 
necessary to have a standing audit, compensation or nominating committee because 
we believe that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by 
the Board of Directors. Additionally, we believe that retaining an independent 
director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be 
overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the 
early stages of our development. 


Item 14. 
Principal Accounting Fees and Services

     We have engaged PLS CPA, a 
professional corp., as our auditors on April 25, 2014. For fiscal years 2014 and 
2015, total audit fees were $0 and $10,000, respectively. We made no other 
payments to our auditors.
