Prior to joining Sealed Air Corporation in 2013, Dr. Kadri was with Dow Chemical Company from 2010 until 2012, where she was the General Manager of the Dow Advanced Materials Division, a specialty materials provider in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, and the Commercial Director for Dow Water & Process Solutions, a global leader in sustainable separation and purification technology. Dr. Kadri joined Dow in 2010 as a Marketing Director for Dow Coating Materials, following its acquisition of Rohm and Haas, where she served as a Marketing Director for the construction, coatings and industrial division since 2007. Dr. Kadri started her career with Royal Dutch Shell PLC in the Netherlands and has held positions of increasing financial and global responsibility with public and private companies. A third-party search firm recommended Dr. Kadri to the Nominating and Governance Committee, which considered Dr. Kadri and recommended to the Board that Dr. Kadri be appointed as a director.

Dr. Kadri has extensive international experience, having held executive leadership roles in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In addition, as a chemical engineer, with a master's degree in physics and chemistry, and a doctorate degree in reactive extrusion, Dr. Kadri brings a unique perspective on manufacturing and research and development, with a focus on sustainability and the water industry that are directly applicable to our industry. She also has broad mergers and acquisition experience that benefits our company. As an added benefit, Dr. Kadri brings gender and ethnic diversity to our Board.

MILWAUKEE, Dec. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:    AOS) has named Dr. Ilham Kadri to its Board of Directors.
Dr. Kadri is a senior vice president at Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:    SEE) and president of the company's Diversey Care Division. Diversey Care is a global leader in hygiene and health solutions, food safety and security, and infection prevention.








In her 20 years of experience, Dr. Kadri has held a variety of global roles in business leadership, strategic planning, sales, marketing, product management, mergers and acquisitions, and R&D, in public and private companies such as Shell-Basell, UCB-Cytec, Huntsman, and Rohm Haas-Dow.
Dr. Kadri joined Sealed Air in January 2013, coming from Dow Chemical, where she held executive leadership roles in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. She is a chemical engineer and has a master's degree in physics and chemistry and a doctorate in reactive extrusion from the University of Strasbourg, France.
Under her leadership, Diversey Care has delivered groundbreaking innovations that deliver more productivity, less waste, more sustainable and reliable cleaning operations, to hotels, hospitals, retail stores, restaurants and facility management companies.
Sealed Air announced the intention to spin-off its Diversey Care Division into a separate publicly traded company and Dr. Kadri will become the chief executive officer of the standalone business. 
"We look forward to adding Ilham's international business perspective, her mergers and acquisitions experience, and her passion for sustainability and the water industry to enhance the vast array of expertise on the A. O. Smith board," Ajita Rajendra, chairman and chief executive officer of A. O. Smith Corporation, said.     
Dr. Kadri is committed to mentoring young women and promoting female leadership in the science, engineering and business fields. She is an Advisory Board member at Catalyst, the leading non-profit organization dedicated to diversity and inclusion.  She is the founder and first Chairwoman of The ISSA Hygieia™ Network, with the mission to advance women at the bottom in the hygiene and cleaning sector.  She has been recognized and awarded throughout her career for her commitment to mentoring young women and fighting female illiteracy.
"Ilham has lived in 13 locations around the world and brings a world of experience to our board, which is critical since A. O. Smith continues to expand globally," Rajendra continued. "Her experience with developing women professionals will also augment our own recently launched Women's Resource Network at A. O. Smith."
A. O. Smith Corporation, with headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis., is a global leader applying innovative technology and energy-efficient solutions to products manufactured and marketed worldwide.  The company is one of the world's leading manufacturers of residential and commercial water heating equipment, as well as a manufacturer of water treatment products.
