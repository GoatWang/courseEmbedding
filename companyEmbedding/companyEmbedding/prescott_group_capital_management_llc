Prescott Capital Management, LLC
						Prescott Capital Management is Prescott’s investment and asset management affiliate.  Its activities are focused on the acquisition and asset management of real property on behalf of 
            institutions, corporate entities, and private clients.
						

						Prescott acquires high quality, income producing commercial properties located in targeted markets throughout the U.S. and internationally.  Prescott’s investment products are structured for institutional
            and private investors and represent an opportunity for 
            investors to participate in real estate based investments managed by sophisticated and experienced professionals.  Prescott particularly sees significant underserved demand among individual investors 
            and investment groups for investment in attractively yielding, institutional quality real estate assets that, to date, have often only been available to major institutional investors and sizeable private 
            investment entities.  These assets are typically acquired in conjunction with leading publicly and privately held real estate investment and operating companies and further benefit from Prescott’s in-depth 
            asset management expertise.   
						

						Prescott accesses private capital through a group of wealth managers that serve the substantial private client, including private banks, brokerages, trust companies, family offices, financial advisors, 
            and other financial service entities.  Prescott sees a depth of demand for alternative product among these groups that serve the significant individual investor marketplace.  These groups see increasing
            demand from their clientele for additional alternative investment opportunities, including private real estate options, to address portfolio diversification and return requirements.  The highly competitive 
            landscape of the wealth management industry creates significant demand for such investments as financial advisors respond to client demand that wealth managers offer a greater depth of sophisticated 
            advisory support for alternative investment products.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
