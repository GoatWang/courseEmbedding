	ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION





	 




	On February 2, 2017, DSP Group, Inc. (the “Company”) announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. A copy of the press release, dated February 2, 2017, is attached and filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This information, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.




	 




	In addition to the disclosure of financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the press release also included non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 that excluded (a) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $425,000 associated with previous acquisitions; equity-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million; and amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions in the amount of $99,000; (b)


	for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $321,000 associated with a previous acquisition; equity-based compensation expenses of $1.2 million; write-off of $400,000 associated with an expired option related to a previous investment in a private company (the “Expired Option”); and amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in a previous acquisition in the amount of $114,000; (c)


	for the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.5 million associated with previous acquisitions; equity-based compensation expenses of $5.1 million; other income in the amount of $2.5 million related to reversal of provisions due to the elapse of applicable statue of limitations;




	and amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in connection with previous acquisitions in the amount of $352,000; and (d)


	for the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.3 million associated with a previous acquisition; equity-based compensation expenses of $5.1 million; write-off of $400,000 associated with the Expired Option;




	and amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in connection with a previous acquisition in the amount of $369,000


	.




	 




	The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation in the press release is useful to investors in analyzing the results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 because the exclusion of such expense may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful for investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of FASB ASC No. 718 are reflected on its statements of income. The non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and are intended to provide additional insight into the Company’s operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, offer a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. The non-GAAP presentation should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results.

	Presentation on Non-GAAP Net Income Calculation





	The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of net income, gross margins, operating margins, and diluted earnings per share presented in this press release is useful to investors in comparing results for the quarter




	and year ended December 31, 2016 to the same periods in 2015 because the exclusion of the above noted expenses may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with equity-based compensation are reflected in its statements of income.




	 





	Forward Looking Statements





	This press release contains statements that qualify as “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Mr. Elyakim’s statements regarding an expectation of revenue slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 due to a decrease in demand for the company's cordless telephony and HDClear products, as well as the optimism that the company remains very well positioned for future growth and profitability due to its new products strategy. The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products, including in the mobile and office segments; slower than expected change in the nature of residential communications domain; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available on DSP Group’s website (www.dspg.com) under Investor Relations. DSP Group assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.

	ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION





	 




	On April 27, 2017, DSP Group, Inc. (the “Company”) announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. A copy of the press release, dated April 27, 2017, is attached and filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This information, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.




	 




	In addition to the disclosure of financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the press release also included non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 that excluded (a) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $425,000 associated with previous acquisitions; equity-based compensation expenses of $1.5 million; and changes in deferred taxes in the amount of $182,000 related to intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions and equity-based compensation expenses


	(b) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $321,000, associated with previous acquisitions, equity-based compensation expenses of $1 million and amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in previous cquisitions in the amount of $80,000


	.




	 




	The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation in the press release is useful to investors in analyzing the results for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 because the exclusion of such expense may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful for investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of FASB ASC No. 718 are reflected on its statements of income. The non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and are intended to provide additional insight into the Company’s operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, offer a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. The non-GAAP presentation should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results.

	7



	- DSP Group

	®

	, Inc.


	(NASDAQ: DSPG), a leading global provider of wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, announced today its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.




	 





	First Quarter Financial Review:






	 






	●






	GAAP and non-GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.13 and $0.05, respectively







	 







	●






	Revenues of $27.9 million, up 1% year-over-year






	 






	●






	GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 43.8% and 44.2%, respectively, a 140 and 160 basis point improvement year-over-year, respectively







	 







	●






	GAAP and non-GAAP operating loss of $3.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, compared to GAAP and non-GAAP operating loss of $3.2 and $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2016, respectively







	 







	●






	GAAP and non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to GAAP and non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million and $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2016, respectively

	Commenting on the results, Ofer Elyakim, CEO of DSP Group, stated, "


	Our first quarter performance reflects continued improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin of 160 bps to 44.2%, and execution of our new products strategy as evidenced by the solid year-over-year revenue growth of 30% and 42%


	in our Office/VoIP and IoT businesses, respectively. These initiatives, together with a modest recovery in our cordless business, more than offset the expected temporary


	shortfall in HDClear revenues.”




	 






	 


	 




	 




	 




	Mr. Elyakim added, “Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect a sequential increase in revenues, propelled by shipments of our HDClear products for non-smartphone applications, market share gains in the Office/VoIP segment and gradual increase in demand for IoT products. More importantly, DSP Group is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of Voice User Interface, by leveraging our proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low power design. We have successfully built a promising and diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs, which is just beginning to materialize, paving a promising path for long term growth.”

	Presentation on Non-GAAP Net Income Calculation






	 



	The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of net income and diluted earnings per share presented in this press release is useful to investors in comparing results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 because the exclusion of the above noted expenses may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with equity-based compensation are reflected in its statements of income.

	Forward Looking Statements






	 



	This press release contains statements that qualify as “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Mr. Elyakim’s statements that the Company expects a sequential increase in revenues, propelled by shipments of its HDClear products for non-smartphone applications, market share gains for its VoIP products and gradual increase in demand for its IoT products, as well as the belief that the Company is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of Voice User Interface and that the pipeline with leading OEMs the Company built paves a path for long term growth.


	The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products such as products with Voice User Interface; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products, including in the mobile and office segments; speed of decline in the cordless market; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available on DSP Group’s website (www.dspg.com) under Investor Relations. DSP Group assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This report and certain information incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements, which are provided under the "safe harbor" protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements that are purely historical in nature, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or are preceded by words such as "will," "may," "should," "could," "expect," "suggest," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," or other similar words. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding:  ? Our expectation that revenues from some of our new products will continue to increase in 2017 and expect such revenues to represent a higher percentage of 2017 total revenues, as compared to 2016;  ? Our anticipation that our gross margin on an annual basis will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as our product mix shifts in favor of new products, which generally have higher gross margins;  ? Our anticipation that annual revenues generated from our new products in the VoIP, home gateway and home-automation domains will increase in 2017 as compared to 2016;  ? Our belief that our past research and development investments in new technologies are paying off;  ? Our belief that new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity, the traditional cordless telephony market using fixed-line telephony will continue to decline, which will continue to reduce our revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products;  ? Our belief that the market will remain price sensitive for 2017 for our traditional cordless telephony products and expect that price erosion and the decrease in the average selling prices of such products to continue; and  ? Our belief that our available cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 should be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future.  All forward looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those express or implied by the forward -looking statements contained in this report. These factors include, but are not limited to, our dependence on one primary distributor, our OEM relationships and competition, as well as those risks described in Part II Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q.  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes trademarks and registered trademarks of DSP Group. Products or service names of other companies mentioned in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.  DSP Group, Inc. is referred to in this Quarterly Report as "DSP Group," "we," "us" "our" or "company."  Overview  The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide investors with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Business Overview  DSP Group is a leading global provider of wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, delivering system solutions that combine semiconductors and software with reference designs. We provide a broad portfolio of wireless chipsets integrating DECT, Wi-Fi, PSTN and VoIP technologies with state-of-the-art application processors. We also enable converged voice, audio and data connectivity across diverse consumer products - from cordless and VoIP phones to home gateways and connected multimedia screens. In addition, our mobile segment products consist of products targeted at mobile, IoT and wearable device markets that incorporate our HDClear technology, as well as other third party advanced voice processing, always on and sensor hub functionalities.  A majority of our revenues is derived from products targeted for digital cordless telephony. Such revenues currently represent approximately 60% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017.  Our revenues were $27.9 million for the first three months of 2017, a 1% increase compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The increase for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily as a result of an increase in sales of our VoIP and cordless telephony products, partially offset by decreased sales of our HDClear products. Revenues from our new products accounted for 40% of our total revenues for the first three months of 2017, as compared to 46% of our total revenues for the first three months of 2016.  Revenues derived from the sale of cordless telephony products represented 60% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to 54% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2016. Sales of our home gateway products represented 10% of our total revenues for both first quarters of 2017 and 2016. Sales of our VoIP products represented 24% of our total revenues for the first quarter 2017, as compared to 18% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2016. Revenues from our HDClear products represented 1% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to 14% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2016. We expect that revenues from some of our new products will continue to increase in 2017 and expect such revenues to represent a higher percentage of 2017 total revenues, as compared to 2016.  Our gross margin increased to 43.8% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017 from 42.4% for the first quarter of 2016, primary due to (i) an improvement in direct contribution and production yield of certain of our products, and (ii) a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers. We anticipated that our gross margin on an annual basis will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as our product mix shifts in favor of new products, which generally have higher gross margins.  Our operating loss was $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in our operating loss is attributed to an increase in total operating expenses for the first three months of 2017 as compared to the corresponding period of 2016. This was partially offset by an increase in total revenues and gross margin for the first three months of 2017, as compared to the corresponding period of 2016. Our operating expenses increased by 5% to $15.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2016, mainly as a result of an increase in equity-based compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2017, as compared for the first quarter of 2016.  Notwithstanding our success in increasing our gross margin as a percentage of our total revenues, we expect that our financial condition will continue to be challenged by the expected decline of the cordless telephony market. With the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity, the traditional cordless telephony market using fixed-line telephony will continue to decline, which will continue to reduce our revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products. Furthermore, our business also may be significantly affected by the outcome of the competition between cellular phone operators and fixed-line operators for the provision of residential communication. A significant majority of our revenues are currently generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixed-line telephony. If we are unable to continue to develop new technologies to address alternative connectivity methods, our business could be materially adversely affected.  We see evidence that our past research and development investments in new technologies are paying off. We achieved a number of design wins for our new products and a number of such new products have begun mass shipments. Aggregate revenues derived from our new products were 40% and 46% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Notwithstanding the loss of a design win for a flagship mobile phone, based on a strong pipeline of design wins, our current mix of new products and anticipated commercialization schedules of customers incorporating our new products, we anticipate annual revenues generated from our new products in the VoIP, home gateway and home-automation domains will increase in 2017 as compared to 2016.  However, despite our successes thus far, we can provide no assurances about our continued success in introducing new products and penetrating new markets, as well as our predictions regarding market trends. Furthermore, although our new products targeted for mobile devices, home control & automation and enterprise VoIP solutions are gradually being introduced into the market, market adoption of such products is at early stages and may require us to increase our research and development spending to capitalize on opportunities in those markets. Moreover, although we have achieved a number of design wins with top-tier OEMs for new products, revenue generated from the commercialization of new products is a measured process as there is generally a long lead time from a design win to commercialization. From initial product design win to volume production, many factors could impact the timing and/or amount of sales actually realized from the design win. In addition to general price sensitivity and price erosion in the markets we operate, the introduction of new products may accelerate price erosion of older products. As a result, we expect the market to remain price sensitive for our traditional cordless telephony products and expect that price erosion and the decrease in the average selling prices of such products to continue. In addition, our continued success and growth in new markets that we have recently gained market share, which markets are highly competitive, is highly dependent on our ability to be designed into future flagship products of top-tier OEMs. Furthermore, various other factors, including increases in the cost of raw materials and commodities and our suppliers passing such increases onto us, increases in silicon wafer costs and increases in production, assembly and testing costs, and shortage of capacity to fulfill our fabrication, assembly and testing needs, all may decrease our gross profit and harm our ability to grow our revenues in future periods.  As of March 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $17.2 million and marketable securities and short term deposits of $102.6 million, totaling $119.8 million.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Total revenues.  The following tables represent our total revenues and our revenues by product family for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in millions):   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Total Revenues (1) $ 27.9 $ 27.7 1% Cordless (2) $ 16.8 $ 14.9 13% Percentage of total revenues 60% 54% Home Gateway $ 2.7 $ 2.7 (1%) Percentage of total revenues 10% 10% Home automation (3) $ 1.5 $ 1.1 42% Percentage of total revenues 5% 4% VoIP (4) $ 6.6 $ 5.1 30% Percentage of total revenues 24% 18% HDClear (5) $ 0.4 $ 3.9 (90%) Percentage of total revenues 1% 14%  1.The increase in revenues for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily as a result of increased sales of our cordless telephony, VoIP and home automation products, offset to some extent by a decrease in sales of our HDClear products.  The following table shows the breakdown of revenues for all product lines for the periods based on the geographic location of our customers (in thousands):  Three months ended March 31,   2017 2016 United States $ 1,299 $ 720 Japan 3,804 2,665 Europe 2,094 1,669 Hong-Kong 11,544 11,702 China 2,347 2,531 Taiwan 4,586 3,367 Korea 869 4,427 Other 1,390 578 Total revenues $ 27,933 $ 27,659  Sales to our customers in Japan increased for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, representing an increase of 43% in absolute dollars. The increase in our sales to Japan for the comparable periods resulted mainly from an increase in sales, through our distributor, Tomen Electronics, Ltd. ("Tomen Electronics"), to Panasonic Communications Ltd ("Panasonic"), representing a 60% increase in absolute dollars for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Sales to our customers in Taiwan increased for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016, representing an increase of 36% in absolute dollars. The increase in our sales to Taiwan for the comparable periods resulted mainly from an increase in sales through our distributor, Ascend Technology Inc. ("Ascend Technology").  Sales to our customers in Korea decreased for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016, representing a decrease of 80% in absolute dollars, resulted mainly from a decrease in demand from our tier one mobile customer.  As our products are generally incorporated into consumer electronics products sold by our OEM customers, our revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer electronics products sold by our OEM customers that incorporate our products, as well as inventory correction cycles within the market.  Significant customers. The Japanese and Hong Kong markets and the OEMs that operate in those markets are among the largest suppliers of residential wireless products with significant market share in the U.S. market. The loss of any of our significant customers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The following table represents our total revenues, as a percentage of our total revenues, from our significant customers for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Vtech Holdings Ltd. 30% 32% Samsung Electronics Ltd. 1% 14%  The following table represents our total revenues, as a percentage of our total revenues, through our main distributors for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Tomen Electronics (1) 12% 9% Ascend Technology (2) 21% 15%  (1) Our distributor, Japan-based Tomen Electronics, sells our products to a limited number of customers; however none of those customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017 or 2016.  (2) Ascend Technology sells our products to a limited number of customers; however none of those customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2017 or 2016.  Significant products. Revenues from our digital cordless telephony products represented 60% and 54% of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe that sales of digital cordless telephony products will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenues for the remainder of 2017. We believe that the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, as well as the lack of growth in fixed-line telephony, will reduce our total revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products for the short and long term.  Revenues from our home gateway products represented 10% of our total revenues for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Revenues from our home automation products represented 5% and 4% of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Revenues from our VoIP products represented 24% and 18% of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Revenues from our HDClear products represented 1% and 14% of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 43.8 % for the first quarter of 2017 and 42.4% for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in our gross profit for the comparable periods was primarily due to (i) an improvement in direct contribution and production yield of certain of our products, and (ii) a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers.  As gross profit reflects the sale of chips and chipsets that have different margins, changes in the mix of products sold have impacted and will continue to impact our gross profit in future periods. Our gross profit may decrease in the future due to a variety of factors, including the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products, changes in the mix of products sold, our failure to achieve cost reductions, roll-out of new products in any given period, our success in introducing new engineering processes to reduce manufacturing costs, increases in the cost of raw materials such as gold, oil and silicon wafers, and increases in production, assembly and testing costs. Moreover, our suppliers may pass the increase in the cost of raw materials and commodities onto us, which would further reduce the gross margins of our products. There are no guarantees that our ongoing efforts in cost reduction and yield improvements will keep pace with the anticipated continuing decline in average selling prices of our products.  Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs of wafer manufacturing and fabrication, assembly and testing of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs, and compensation and associated expenses related to manufacturing and testing support, inventory obsolesce and logistics personnel.  Research and development expenses, net. Our research and development expenses, net, increased to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $8.9 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase for the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to (i) a decrease in funding received from Israeli Innovation Authority ("IIA") (formerly known as Office of the Chief Scientist) in the amount of $0.5 million, as compared to the first quarter of 2016, and (ii) an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $0.2 million, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Those increases were partially offset by a decrease in subcontractor and labor contractor expenses for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Our research and development expenses, net, as a percentage of our total revenues were 33% and 32% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses, net, as a percentage of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was mainly due to an increase in research and development expenses for the comparable periods.  Research and development expenses consist mainly of payroll expenses to employees involved in research and development activities, expenses related to tape out and mask work, subcontracting, labor contractors and engineering expenses, depreciation and maintenance fees related to equipment and software tools used in research and development, and facilities expenses associated with and allocated to research and development activities.  Sales and marketing expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses increased to $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2017, compared to the comparable period of 2016, was mainly due to an increase in equity-based compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Our sales and marketing expenses, net, as a percentage of our total revenues were 13% and 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase as a percentage of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was mainly due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses for the comparable periods.  Sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of sales commissions, payroll expenses to direct sales and marketing employees, travel, trade show expenses, and facilities expenses associated with and allocated to sales and marketing activities.  General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses were $2.5 million and $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the comparable period of 2016, was mainly due to an increase in employee related expenses and equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the corresponding period of 2016.  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 9% and 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of our total revenues for the three months period ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2016, was mainly due to an increase in general and administrative expenses for the comparable periods.  Our general and administrative expenses consist mainly of payroll expenses for management and administrative employees, accounting and legal fees, expenses related to investor relations as well as facilities expenses associated with general and administrative activities.  Description of segments.  We operate under three reportable segments.  Our segment information has been prepared in accordance with ASC 280, "Segment Reporting." Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the company's chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating income.  Our operating segments are as follows: Home, Office and Mobile. The classification of our business segments is based on a number of factors that our management uses to evaluate, view and run the company's business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology.  A description of the types of products provided by each business segment is as follows:  Home - Wireless chipset solutions for converged communication at home. Such solutions include integrated circuits targeted for cordless phones sold in retail or supplied by telecommunication service providers, home gateway devices supplied by telecommunication service providers which integrate the DECT/CAT-iq functionality, integrated circuits addressing home automation applications, as well as fixed-mobile convergence solutions. In this segment, (i) revenues from cordless telephony products exceeded 10% of our total consolidated revenues and amounted to 60% and 54% of our total revenues for the first three months of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and (ii) revenues from home gateway products amounted to 10% of our total revenues for both the first three months of 2017 and 2016.  Office - Comprehensive solution for Voice-over-IP (VoIP) office products, including office solutions that offer businesses of all sizes low-cost VoIP terminals with converged voice and data applications. VoIP products in the Office segment represented 24% and 18% of our total revenues for the first three months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. No revenues derived from other products in the office segment exceeded 10% of our total consolidated revenues for the first three months of 2017 and 2016.  Mobile - Products for the mobile market that provides voice enhancement, always-on and far-end noise elimination targeted for mobile phone and mobile headsets and wearable devices that incorporate our noise suppression and voice quality enhancement HDClear technology. Revenues derived from products in the mobile segment represented 1% and 14% of our total revenues for the first three months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. No revenues derived from other HDClear products in the mobile segment exceeded 10% of our total consolidated revenues for the first three months of 2017 and 2016.  Segment data. We derive the results of our business segments directly from our internal management reporting system and by using certain allocation methods. The accounting policies we use to derive business segment results are substantially the same as those the Company uses for consolidation of our financial statements. The CODM measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. We do not allocate to our business segments certain operating expenses, which are managed separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible . . .  May 10, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

In addition to the disclosure of financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the press release also included non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 that excluded (a) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $425,000, associated with previous acquisitions, equity-based compensation expenses of $1.6 million and changes in deferred tax in the amount of $20,000 related to intangible assets and equity-based compensation expenses, and (b) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $321,000, associated with previous acquisitions, equity-based compensation expenses of $1.3 million and changes in deferred tax of $80,000 related to intangible assets.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation in the press release is useful to investors in analyzing the results for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 because the exclusion of such expense may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful for investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of FASB ASC No.718 are reflected on its statements of income. The non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and are intended to provide additional insight into the Company’s operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, offer a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. The non-GAAP presentation should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results.

Such revenues accounted for 47% of our total sales, thereby propelling GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to a ten year high of 46.3% and 46.6%, respectively. Moreover, we are delighted by the solid market traction for our new products and their contribution to our revenue and profit, with Office/VoIP and IoT posting record revenues of $8.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.” Mr. Elyakim added, “Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in revenues, propelled by an increase in shipments of our SmartVoice products for voice user interface in non-smartphone applications and demand for Office/VoIP products. More importantly, DSP Group is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of voice user interface by leveraging our proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low power design. We are making solid progress in augmenting our diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs. This pipeline is materializing, evidenced by commercial shipments to two new customers, and paving a promising path for long term growth.” Second Quarter Product and Market Highlights:  New product revenues of $14.7 million, 47% of total revenuesOffice/VoIP revenues of $8.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 17%Home gateway revenues of $2.9 million, a year-over-year increase of 9%IoT revenues of $2.3 million, a year-over-year increase of 80%SmartVoice (HDClear) revenues of $0.9 million, a year-over-year decrease of 81%Deutsche Telekom launched its IoT-enabled broadband HGW and a new lineup of Magenta Smart Home sensors based on our ULE technologyTier 1 European Telco selected our DECT/ULE to power its new home gatewayiFLYTEK a leading voice-recognition provider selected our DBMD4D SoC for its new IoT module Second Quarter GAAP Results:Revenues for the second quarter of 2017 were $31.3 million, a decrease of 13% from revenues of $36.2 million for the second quarter of 2016.  Net loss for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.6 million, as compared to a net income of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2016.  Loss per share for the second quarter of 2017 was $(0.03), as compared to $0.05 earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016.

Further, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with equity-based compensation are reflected in its statements of income. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains statements that qualify as “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Mr. Elyakim’s statements (i) about the market traction for the company’s new products (ii) that the company expects a sequential increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2017, propelled by shipments of its SmartVoice products for non-smartphone applications and demand for its Office/VoIP products, (iii) that the company is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of voice user interface by leveraging its proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low power design, and (iv) the company is making solid progress in augmenting its diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs and this materializing pipeline is paving a promising path for long term growth.  The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products such as products with SmartVoice/HDClear, VoIP, ULE and Home Gateway products; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products; speed of decline in the cordless market; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available on DSP Group’s website (www.dspg.com) under Investor Relations. DSP Group assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. About DSP Group DSP Group®, Inc.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 27, 2017, DSP Group, Inc. (the "Company") announced its financial
results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. A copy of the press release, dated
July 27, 2017, is attached and filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This information,
including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes
of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated
by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be
expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
In addition to the disclosure of financial results for the quarter ended June
30, 2017 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ("GAAP"), the press release also included non-GAAP net income and
diluted earnings per share, for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 that
excluded (a) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the impact of amortization of
acquired intangible assets in the amount of $425,000, associated with previous
acquisitions, equity-based compensation expenses of $1.6 million and changes in
deferred tax in the amount of $20,000 related to intangible assets and
equity-based compensation expenses, and (b) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of
$321,000, associated with previous acquisitions, equity-based compensation
expenses of $1.3 million and changes in deferred tax of $80,000 related to
intangible assets.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation in the press release is
useful to investors in analyzing the results for the quarters ended June 30,
2017 and 2016 because the exclusion of such expense may provide a more
meaningful analysis of the Company's core operating results. Further, the
Company believes it is useful for investors to understand how the expenses
associated with the application of FASB ASC No. 718 are reflected on its
statements of income. The non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to
and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and are
intended to provide additional insight into the Company's operations that, when
viewed with its GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to
corresponding GAAP financial measures, offer a more complete understanding of
factors and trends affecting the Company's business. The non-GAAP presentation
should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company's reported GAAP results.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

Overview


Targeting home, enterprise, and mobile markets, DSP Group’s comprehensive chipset portfolio reduces development risk costs, and shortens time to market.
ODMs and service providers use our system-on-chips (SoCs), hardware reference packages (HDKs) and software development packages (SDKs) to rapidly and cost-effectively develop cutting edge consumer electronics and business products.








 HDClear™ – Voice Enhancement For Mobile & IoT – DBM Family









DSP Group’s DBM family of SoCs - DBMD2 (D2A3X) and DBMD4 (DSP D4A1A) - offers the ultimate noise-cancellation experience to users of mobile phones, wearable
devices, tablets, DECT wireless and wired headsets, and fixed-line corded or cordless phones.
The DBM chipsets are available in small footprints and embed DSP Group’s advanced HDClear™ technology. DBM
 chipsets dramatically suppress background noise for far-end users, enhance privacy for near-end speakers, and
maximize performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines.
The DBMD2 chip is DSP Group’s most advanced solution for voice communications. It supports a rich set of voice processing features to significantly enhance voice call quality, intelligibility and speech recognition accuracy, including:

System-On-Chip (SOCs) 
 IoT Application Developers with radio design and production know-how are encouraged to consider designing a ULE Node/Device using DSP Group's DHX91 68 -pin SOC in a discrete design. Developers needing to integrate a DECT-ULE Hub into a gateway, over-the-top-box or some other focal point of the star network, can consider a discrete design with the DCX81 68-pin SOC. 

Modules For Developer's with agressive Time-to-Market goals, a practical solution is to embed  a DSP Group module into the applicarion PCB. Currently available is the DHAN-S Module which can be used in a ULE Dual-Mode (data and audio) application on the Device side as well as a data-only ULE application on the Hub side. The DHAN-S does not include an antenna. By the end of 2017, the DHAN-J will be offered which will feature an on-board antenna and regulatory certification that can be leveraged by the customer. Both these modules can be paired (via UART) with a Host Application Processor that interfaces with the sensor or actuator. Alternatively, the the on-board stack can be customized to suit "standalone" ULE applications. 

 For a full-fledged Hub supporting a both ULE and traditional Cordless devices, DSP Group will soon  make available (end of 2017) the DHAN-M Module. This module has both UART and USB interfaces (for control) as well as a TDM interface for exchange of PCM audio with the Host Processor. This module can also be used for a DECT Device high-end, smart audio applications where the Host Processor includes a microphone and speaker and requires wireless access to a phone-line (PSTN or VOIP).
