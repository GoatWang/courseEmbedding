Marina Biotech Acquires DyrctAxess™ Technology Platform to Support Sales and Marketing of Prestalia®




















July 24, 2017 12:00 ET

CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marina Biotech, Inc. (OTCQB:MRNA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for disease intersections of arthritis, hypertension and cancer, announced today that it has acquired DyrctAxess™ Technology Platform from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals Inc.. DyrctAxess™ offers enhanced efficiency, control and information to empower patients, physicians and manufacturers to help achieve optimal care. The secure, web-based, HIPAA-compliant platform provides: Direct fulfillment of physician prescriptions at a fixed cost to patientsEasy prescription, tracking and refill management via mobile applications (iPhone and Android)Real-time monitoring and communications between patients and physiciansComplete database capture of insurance reimbursement and transparency of co-pay and coverage positionsAutomatic patient reminders and refillsEnhanced security with 128 bit SSL Prestalia® will continue to be marketed using DyrctAxess™, which drove strong compliance and patient engagement when developed by Symplmed. Prestalia® is currently protected by two patents listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. The two Prestalia patents (6696481 and 7846961) offer product exclusivity until 2029. The acquisition of DyrctAxess™ follows the recent acquisition of Prestalia and continues Marina’s process of building a commercial organization which can support multiple products.  Erik Emerson, Chief Commercial Officer of Marina Biotech, stated, “We will be building our sales and marketing capabilities around DyrctAxess™ with an eye toward building a commercial organization focused on efficiency, meeting patient needs and enhancing our patients’ experience.” Mr. Emerson continued, ‘We look forward to leveraging this platform for products developed organically and those we pursue through licensing efforts.” About Prestalia®Prestalia® contains perindopril arginine, an ACE inhibitor, and amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Prestalia® may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy. Prestalia® may be used as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor class to which perindopril principally belongs. FDA approval of Prestalia® was based on data from the 837-patient Phase III PATH trial (Perindopril Amlodipine for the Treatment of Hypertension). The study demonstrated that the fixed-dose combination of perindopril arginine with amlodipine besylate in a single pill was significantly better than either compound alone in reducing both sitting diastolic and sitting systolic blood pressure after six weeks of treatment. It also suggested that the combination may provide a better benefit/risk ratio than either treatment alone. About Marina BiotechMarina Biotech’s focus is to treat the intersection of arthritis, pain, hypertension, and oncology diseases using combination therapies of already approved drugs. The company is developing and commercializing late stage, non-addictive pain therapeutics. The company’s ‘next-generation of celecoxib,’ including IT-102 and IT-103, are designed to control the dangerous side-effect of edema that prohibits the drug from being prescribed at higher doses. These have the potential of replacing opioids and combatting the opioid epidemic. Additionally we are developing therapeutic microbiome using the only orally bioavailable siRNAs platform against FAP and IBD. Additional information about Marina Biotech is available at http://www.marinabio.com. About Symplmed Symplmed Pharmaceuticals is a private pharmaceutical company optimizing the value of its medicines and those of its industry partners by streamlining the prescription process, from fulfillment and payment to therapeutic compliance and outcomes monitoring. The Company's patented technology platform, DyrctAxess™, enables direct delivery of medications to a patient's home and addresses the problem of unfilled prescriptions. Symplmed is taking a therapeutic area approach, ensuring that medications necessary to manage a particular disease state are available through its DyrctAxess platform.

 Marina Biotech Announces Binding Letter of Intent for the Sale of its DiLA2 Delivery Platform




                    Tuesday, July 25, 2017 4:00 PM  UTC                                            
0 comments                        



CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif., July  25, 2017   -- Marina Biotech, Inc. (OTCQB:MRNA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for disease intersections of arthritis, hypertension, and cancer, today announced that it has entered into a binding letter of intent with a biotech company in the gene editing space for the sale of Marina’s DiLA2 delivery platform.﻿﻿
Under the terms of the letter of intent, Marina will receive $1.5 million, with $300,000 due upon the closing of the transaction and the balance of $1.2 million due upon either a successful fundraising by the buyer above a certain minimum dollar amount or the 1-year anniversary of the closing of the transaction, whichever comes first. The deadline for closing is August 30, 2017.  Marina will retain an exclusive, fully paid and royalty free license to DiLA2 outside of the field of gene editing, as well as the rights to license DiLA2 outside of gene editing. “This proposed transaction is consistent with Marina Biotech’s stated intentions to narrow its focus to pain and hypertension and to look to monetize its oligotherapeutic assets,” stated Joseph W. Ramelli, CEO of Marina Biotech. “Upon closing, this deal will bring in non-dilutive capital to Marina, which would extend our cash runway and allow us to invest in building out the commercial infrastructure to support the launch of the recently acquired Prestalia. We continue to seek out other opportunities to monetize our oligotherapeutic assets, be that either through a sale, a spin off to our shareholders, or by out-licensing of the technology.” About Marina Biotech, Inc.Marina Biotech's focus is to treat the intersection of arthritis, pain, hypertension, and oncology diseases using combination therapies of already approved drugs. Marina’s first FDA approved drug, Prestalia®, contains perindopril arginine, an ACE inhibitor, and amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. The company is developing and commercializing late stage, non-addictive pain therapeutics. The company's 'next-generation of celecoxib,' including IT-102 and IT-103, are designed to control the dangerous side-effect of edema that prohibits the drug from being prescribed at higher doses. These have the potential of replacing opioids and combatting the opioid epidemic. Additionally we are developing therapeutic microbiome using the only orally bioavailable siRNAs platform against FAP and IBD.

WELCOME TO MARINA BIOTECH
Marina Biotech’s focus is to treat the intersection of arthritis, pain, hypertension, and oncology diseases using combination therapies of already approved drugs. The company is developing and commercializing late stage, non-addictive pain therapeutics. The company’s ‘next-generation of celecoxib,’ including IT-102 and IT-103, are designed to control the dangerous side-effect of edema that prohibits the drug from being prescribed at higher doses. These have the potential of replacing opioids and combating the opioid epidemic.
















Problems: Edema, Pain and Opioid Epidemic
Drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase in the United States. The majority of drug overdose deaths (more than six out of ten) involve an opioid. We now know that overdoses from prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 15-year increase in opioid overdose deaths. Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, yet there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report. Deaths from prescription opioids—drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone—have more than quadrupled since 1999.

Solution: Next Gen Celecoxib without Opioid addiction
While opioids will certainly continue to have a place in pain management despite their disadvantages, the use of non-opioid medication options may limit the amount of opioid necessary or even result in improved pain control. In fact, given that the majority of both acute and chronic pain is thought to be complex and multifactorial, a multimodal analgesic approach is ideal for management. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used analgesic. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and headaches, are common conditions that NSAIDs treat.

Result of PLD analyses
This was a retrospective study that used two patient level data (PLD) sources: (1) anonymous PLD from Symphony from Jan 2012 to Dec 2014 (3 years), and (2) Pinnacle registry data from American College of Cardiology (ACC) over the same time period with detailed clinical data such as blood pressure readings, peripheral edema flags, etc. In Symphony dataset there were 162 million (M) unique pts, 4.3M pts on celecoxib, 16.3M pts with osteoarthritis (OA)(15.4M only OA), and 2.3M pts with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1.4M only RA). In ACC dataset, there were 870,000 pts with edema flag.

					Full Description



Marina Biotech, Inc., incorporated on October 23, 1983, is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of nucleic acid-based therapies to treat orphan diseases. The Company's pipeline includes CEQ508, a product in clinical development for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), for which it has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Fast Track Designation (FTD) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and preclinical programs for the treatment of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).The Company creates a range of therapeutics targeting coding and non-coding ribonucleic acid (RNA) through several mechanisms of action, such as RNA interference (RNAi), messenger RNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, microRNA (miRNA) replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action. The Company uses its drug discovery platform to discover and develop multiple nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including small interfering RNA (siRNA), miRNA mimics and single stranded oligonucleotide-based compounds.The Company has over two liposomal-based delivery platforms. The first platform, SMARTICLES, defines a class of liposomes that are charge-reversible particles allowing delivery of active substance (siRNA, single-stranded oligonucleotides) inside a cell either by local or systemic administration. The second platform utilizes amino-based liposomal delivery technology and incorporates a molecule, Di-Alkylated Amino Acid (DiLA2). Its TransKingdom RNA interference (tkRNAi) platform involves the modification of bacteria to deliver short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to cells of the gastrointestinal tract.The Company is developing CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP, a hereditary condition. FAP is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. As a result of these mutations, epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract have increased levels of the protein beta-catenin, which in turn results in uncontrolled cell growth. CEQ508 utilizes the tkRNAi platform. It is an orally administered RNAi-based therapeutic in clinical development. CEQ508 consists of attenuated bacteria that are engineered to enter into dysplastic tissue and release a payload of shRNA, a mediator in the RNAi pathway. The Company is developing CEQ508 to reduce the levels of beta-catenin protein in the epithelial cells of the small and large intestine. Upon enrollment in the Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial, patients are placed in one of four dose-escalating cohorts. The Company completed dosing for Cohort 2 in the dose escalation Phase of the safety and tolerability of an RNAi therapeutic in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (START-FAP) clinical trial of CEQ508.The Company competes with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc., Benitec Biopharma, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Isis Pharmaceuticals, miRagen Therapeutics, Mirna Therapeutics, Inc., PhaseRx Pharmaceuticals, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Regulus Therapeutics, RXi Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics and Silence Therapeutics.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 





 Share

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

WELCOME TO MARINA BIOTECH
Marina Biotech’s focus is to treat the intersection of arthritis, pain, hypertension, and oncology diseases using combination therapies of already approved drugs. The company is developing and commercializing late stage, non-addictive pain therapeutics. The company’s ‘next-generation of celecoxib,’ including IT-102 and IT-103, are designed to control the dangerous side-effect of edema that prohibits the drug from being prescribed at higher doses. These have the potential of replacing opioids and combating the opioid epidemic.
















Problems: Edema, Pain and Opioid Epidemic
Drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase in the United States. The majority of drug overdose deaths (more than six out of ten) involve an opioid. We now know that overdoses from prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 15-year increase in opioid overdose deaths. Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, yet there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report. Deaths from prescription opioids—drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone—have more than quadrupled since 1999.

Solution: Next Gen Celecoxib without Opioid addiction
While opioids will certainly continue to have a place in pain management despite their disadvantages, the use of non-opioid medication options may limit the amount of opioid necessary or even result in improved pain control. In fact, given that the majority of both acute and chronic pain is thought to be complex and multifactorial, a multimodal analgesic approach is ideal for management. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used analgesic. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and headaches, are common conditions that NSAIDs treat.

Result of PLD analyses
This was a retrospective study that used two patient level data (PLD) sources: (1) anonymous PLD from Symphony from Jan 2012 to Dec 2014 (3 years), and (2) Pinnacle registry data from American College of Cardiology (ACC) over the same time period with detailed clinical data such as blood pressure readings, peripheral edema flags, etc. In Symphony dataset there were 162 million (M) unique pts, 4.3M pts on celecoxib, 16.3M pts with osteoarthritis (OA)(15.4M only OA), and 2.3M pts with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1.4M only RA). In ACC dataset, there were 870,000 pts with edema flag.
