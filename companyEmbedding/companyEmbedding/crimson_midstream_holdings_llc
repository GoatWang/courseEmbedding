Ultra-Low Carbon Biodiesel
Crimson is California’s largest producer of ultra-low carbon biodiesel. Our product exceeds ASTM D6751, is BQ-9000 certified, and meets individual end-user and terminal specifications year-round. Crimson’s biodiesel is a cleaner-burning fuel that significantly reduces carbon emissions while helping boost the longevity and performance of diesel engines.
 
 
 
 





 

What is ultra-low carbon biodiesel?
Biodiesel is a “drop in” diesel fuel that can be used in any diesel engine, typically in blends with petroleum-based diesel fuel. 
Ultra-low carbon biodiesel is an advanced biofuel that achieves less than 20g CO2e/MJ via California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Crimson’s biodiesel releases 80% less carbon than petroleum diesel.
 
 
 
 






Renewable Fuel
Crimson biodiesel turns waste – inedible animal fats, used oils like cooking greases and vegetable oils – into renewable, ultra-low carbon biodiesel.

 
 
 




Reduces Harmful Pollutants
The higher the percentage content of biodiesel (B20 vs. B5), the greater the reduction in CO, CO2, hydrocarbons, particulate matter emissions, and carbon output.

 
 
 




Increases Energy Independence
American-made, renewable fuel reduces dependence on foreign oil and fuels. 

 
 
 
 





Safe-to-Use
Biodiesel contains no hazardous materials and it biodegrades faster than diesel. Its use is preferred in environmentally sensitive areas.

 
 
 




Easy-to-Use
Equipment or engine modifications are not necessary. Biodiesel can be stored in existing diesel fuel tanks and pumped with existing equipment.

 
 
 




Improves Lubricity
High solvent and lubricity properties of biodiesel reduce wear and extend component life compared to ultra-low sulfur diesel.

Future of Fuels | Crimson Renewable Energy LP






















 





















Select Page


  
 



 



 








 



The Future of Fuels
Petroleum-based transportation fuels are a vital source of energy, and will remain so for many decades to come. However, these petroleum-based fuels contribute approximately 40% of total carbon emissions. As the global community seeks to address climate change, reduce those emissions, and develop sustainable sources of energy, these fuels are evolving. The United States implemented the Renewable Fuels Standard in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels. California and Oregon have expanded on these efforts with their Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs to achieve a 10% reduction in those carbon emissions by 2020. In all, 64 countries on six continents have adapted initiatives to reduce harmful emissions via the use of biofuels.
 
 
 




 

We Are Part of a New Future
Conventional petroleum-based fuels have made vast improvements in recent decades, but to continue that advancement, fuels must evolve to burn cleaner.
Advanced biofuels like Crimson’s ultra-low carbon biodiesel are paving the way for the future of fuel by helping petroleum-based diesel achieve its environmental objectives.
 
 
 


We Make Petroleum Fuels Better Using Innovative Technologies
We develop and use innovative technologies to convert waste materials into ultra-low carbon biodiesel. Used cooking oil, byproduct animal fats, and inedible corn oil from ethanol production are utilized in our process.
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard identifies biodiesel produced from these waste products as the cleanest burning, lowest environmental impact transportation fuel available today.
 
 



 
 
 



We Are All Part of a New Way Forward
Advanced biofuels combined with conventional petroleum-based fuels are the future. The environmental and economic benefits of a new industry like biodiesel boost local, regional and global communities.
 
 
 
 



We Help Improve Health and the Environment
Ultra-low carbon biodiesel fuel can help decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 80%+ and reduce other harmful pollutants by up to 50% compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel. 
Another key factor is the health benefits that come from cleaner burning fuels. Cleaner burning fuels means cleaner air, which means less asthma and reductions in lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses.
 
 



 
 




 

We Deliver Great Benefits to the Community
Biodiesel not only delivers environmental and health benefits, it also benefits the community economically by offering high-quality/high-paying manufacturing jobs, as well as increased demands for local goods and services. 
But biodiesel’s benefits affect more than just the city where the plant is located. These local benefits promote a healthy regional community, have a rippling economic effect on the entire region, and a global effect by reducing our carbon footprint.
