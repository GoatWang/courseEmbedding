About Me

What made you want to become a health care provider or what is your earliest memory of wanting to be one?My goal is to assist others to the best of my abilities. Considering my strengths and weaknesses, in college I decided a career in medicine would best achieve that goal.
What do you love most about your specialty? / Why did you choose your specialty?I enjoy helping children, adolescents and their families to be as healthy, happy and productive as possible.
How do you connect with your patients?I do my best to share the concerns of my patients and their families.
What are your interests outside of the office (hobbies, activities)?I enjoy being with my lovely wife, our two sons and their families. My wife and I swim, hike and bicycle. I bike to work and have run the New York City Marathon three times. I'm an avid Yankee fan.
What is your advice for your patients?I strive to guide my patients through all the medical and emotional challenges they may face.
