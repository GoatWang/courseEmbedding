PART I






ITEM 1.  BUSINESS



Unless otherwise indicated, all references to "Notes" are to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd.
contained in this report.  Capitalized terms used herein, but not defined,
have the same meanings as used in the Notes.


The registrant, JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd. (the
"Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed in 1983 and currently
governed by the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of
Illinois for the original purpose of acquiring and owning an approximate
48.25% interest in 245 Park Avenue Company, a New York general partnership,
("245 Park" or the "Joint Venture") which owned and operated an office
building located at 245 Park Avenue, New York, New York.  The Partnership
was admitted to the Joint Venture through the purchase of one of the
existing unaffiliated joint venture partner's interests.  The unaffiliated
venture partners (the "O&Y partners") were affiliates of Olympia & York
Developments, Ltd. ("O&Y").  On May 7, 1984, the Partnership commenced a
private offering of $124,300,000 in Limited Partnership Interests (the
"Interests") pursuant to a Private Placement Memorandum (the "Private
Placement Memorandum") in accordance with Rules 501-503 and 506 of
Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.  The offering closed on June
28, 1984.  The holders of Interests (herein after "Holders" or "Holders of
Interests") in the Partnership share in their portion of the benefits of
ownership of the Partnership's real property investment according to the
number of Interests held.


As a result of the financial difficulties of the O&Y partners, in
October 1995 each of the O&Y partners and certain other O&Y affiliates (but
not the Joint Venture) filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.   As a result of the plan
of restructuring (the "Plan"), which became effective on November 21, 1996
("Effective Date"), the Partnership owned through JMB 245 Park Avenue
Holding Company, LLC ("245 Park Holding") an approximate 5.4% general
partner interest in Brookfield Financial Properties, L.P. ("BFP, LP"),
formerly known as World Financial Properties, L.P.  The managing general
partner of BFP, LP is not affiliated with the Partnership and, subject to
the partnership agreement of BFP, LP and the JMB Transaction Agreement
(discussed below), has full authority to manage its affairs.  245 Park
Holding is a limited liability company in which the Partnership is a 99%
member and WFP Property G.P. Corp. ("WFP, GP"), which is an affiliate of
the managing general partner of BFP, LP, is a 1% member.


BFP, LP's principal assets are majority and controlling interests in
office buildings, certain of which are owned subject to ground leases of
the underlying land.


As a result of transactions noted below, at December 31, 2005, the
Partnership holds an approximate .5% interest in BFP, LP.  Persons who are
interested in obtaining information concerning BFP, LP should be aware that
Brookfield Properties Corporation ("BPC") files periodic reports and other
information, which includes information about BFP, LP and its assets and
operations, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
BPC's filings with the SEC are available to the public through the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system accessible through
the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov.  Interested persons also may read
and copy any report, statement or other information that BPC has filed with
the SEC at its Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20549, or may call the SEC for more information on obtaining
information from the SEC's public reference rooms.  This description is
provided for informational purposes only.  The Partnership does not
prepare, and is not responsible for the preparation of, any of BPC's
reports or other information it files with the SEC including, but not
limited to, those concerning the business and financial results of BFP, LP.





Those reports and other information are not intended to be incorporated by
reference into this report on Form 10-K, and the Partnership has no
responsibility for the accuracy of any information included in BPC's
reports or other information.


The Partnership's interest in BFP, LP was pledged as collateral for
certain notes payable (collectively "the JMB Notes") which aggregated
approximately $89,337,000 in principal and interest at December 31, 2002,
(immediately prior to repayment), to JMB Realty Corporation ("JMB").  The
security agreements for the JMB Notes required mandatory payment of
principal and interest out of any net proceeds received upon the
redemption, refinancing or other disposition of, or any distribution made
with respect to, the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.


On December 31, 2002 (the "Redemption Date") 245 Park Holding entered
into a redemption agreement (the "Partial Redemption") by and among 245
Park Holding, WFP, GP and BFP, LP pursuant to which 245 Park Holding
transferred and BFP, LP thereby redeemed approximately 90% of its
approximate 5.4% interest (the "Redeemed Interest"), in BFP, LP, and 245
Park Holding received a distribution of approximately $56,109,000 (the
"Redemption Distribution").  245 Park Holding's remaining interest in BFP,
LP is approximately .5%, represented by 567.375 Class A Units (the
"Retained Interest").  In accordance with the 245 Park Holding limited
liability company agreement, 245 Park Holding distributed approximately
$55,548,000 (99% of the Redemption Distribution) to the Partnership and
approximately $561,000 (1% of the Redemption Distribution) to WFP, GP.  The
Partnership received its share of the Redemption Distribution on the
Redemption Date and in accordance with the security agreements relating to
the JMB Notes, the Partnership then paid to JMB approximately $55,548,000
as repayment toward the JMB Notes.  One JMB Note remained after such
repayment, which was secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.


On October 8, 2004, the Partnership and JMB entered into an agreement
to split the JMB Note (which had an unpaid principal and accrued and
deferred interest balance at October 8, 2004 of approximately $30,531,000)
into two separate replacement notes (the "Replacement Notes"), whereby the
Partnership issued the Replacement Notes payable to JMB that allocated the
outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest under the JMB
Note between the Replacement Notes in the amounts of $3,482,284 of
principal and $385,345 of accrued and unpaid interest to one Replacement
Note ("Replacement Note 1") and $22,017,716 of principal and all other
accrued and all unpaid interest totaling $4,645,531 (including all of the
default interest of $4,631,375) to the second Replacement Note
("Replacement Note 2").  The division of the JMB Note and its replacement
by Replacement Note 1 and Replacement Note 2 resulted in those two notes
superseding the JMB Note.  The security, interest rate and maturity date
for the Replacement Notes remained unchanged from those under the JMB Note.


Through a series of transactions, JMB assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to JMB Park Avenue, Inc., which is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of JMB and the Corporate General Partner of the
Partnership.  Effective October 8, 2004, the Corporate General Partner and
the Partnership entered into an Assignment and Contribution Agreement,
pursuant to which the Corporate General Partner assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to the Partnership as an additional, voluntary
contribution of capital.  This resulted in the release of the Partnership
from liability for repayment of Replacement Note 2 (with aggregate
principal and interest of $26,663,247).  Due to the decrease in the
Partnership's outstanding indebtedness, interest accruals in future periods
will be substantially less.  Replacement Note 1 remains as outstanding
indebtedness of the Partnership owed to JMB and is secured by the
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.  The unpaid principal and accrued
interest balance of Replacement Note 1 at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
$3,961,754 and $3,884,073, respectively.





In addition to the amounts owing to JMB under Replacement Note 1,
advances totaling $135,000 and $222,000 were made to the Partnership from
JMB in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  These advances are evidenced by a
demand note ("Demand Note") dated December 1, 2004 which bears interest at
prime plus 1 percent and is secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP,
LP.  Additional advances totaling $20,000 were made by JMB under the Demand
Note in January 2006.  JMB is under no obligation to make further advances
and has the right to require repayment of the Demand Note together with
accrued and unpaid interest at any time.


In connection with the Partial Redemption, the limited partnership
agreement of BFP, LP was amended (the "Amendment") to, among other things,
provide for the right of the Partnership to consent to the nomination of an
independent director to the board of directors of BPC.  The Amendment also
generally provides that in the event either (i) a sale or other disposition
of the 245 Park Avenue Building by BFP, LP results in the recognition by
the Partnership of gain for Federal income tax purposes, or (ii) as a
result of a merger or consolidation of BFP, LP, the Partnership thereafter
holds less than one-half of its Retained Interest in a form which does not
give rise to a material amount of gain for Federal income tax purposes, the
Partnership may elect to sell to BFP, LP, or BFP, LP may elect to redeem
from the Partnership, the Retained Interest at its fair market value (as
defined in the BFP, LP partnership agreement) per Class A Unit, but in no
event less than 80% ($8,790), and no greater than 120% ($13,186), of the
Redemption Distribution per Class A Unit in the Partial Redemption.


Under the terms of the Amendment, BFP, LP is obligated to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, in any agreement of merger or
consolidation entered into by BFP, LP on or before December 2007, to the
extent that the consideration is comprised in whole or in part of equity
interests, to provide for the Partnership to obtain its share of such
equity interests in a form such that the Partnership will not recognize a
material amount of gain for Federal income tax purposes.  If BFP, LP,
having used its commercially reasonable efforts, is unable to provide for
the Partnership to receive such an equity interest, BFP, LP must pay to the
Partnership, in addition to the Partnership's share of the merger
consideration, a cash amount equal to the percentage of the merger
consideration in the form of equity multiplied by a number which is $14
million in 2003 and reduces by $1.5 million per year through the year 2007.


BFP, LP has had the right to sell the 245 Park Avenue property
without the consent of the Partnership since January 2000.  BFP, LP
notified the Partnership that it sold a 49% interest in the 245 Park Avenue
property to an unaffiliated third party on October 2, 2003.  The
Partnership did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 49% interest
in 245 Park Avenue.  However, as a result of such transaction, and subject
to the terms of the transaction, a substantial amount of gain for Federal
and state income tax purposes was allocated to the Holders of Interests
without any distribution of cash.  Under certain circumstances, the
Partnership may have obligations for Federal or state withholding or
estimated tax payments on behalf of certain Holders of Interests.
Notwithstanding any such obligations, the Partnership believes that the
Holders of Interests have the ultimate responsibility for the timely filing
of state and Federal tax returns and the payment of all related taxes,
including the reimbursement to the Partnership of all withholding tax
payments or estimated tax payments made on their behalf.


BFP, LP has a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding.  Any
proceeds from the sale of the buildings in which BFP, LP has an interest
would be first applied to repayment of the mortgage and other indebtedness
of BFP, LP.  In any event, any net proceeds obtained by the Partnership
could then be available to satisfy Replacement Note 1 and the Demand Note
(previously discussed).  Only after such applications would any remaining
proceeds be available to be distributed to the Holders of Interests.
Similarly, in the event of a sale or other disposition of the Retained
Interest (including a redemption pursuant to an election discussed above),
the Partnership's share of the proceeds of such sale or disposition would
be available to satisfy Replacement Note 1 and the Demand Note.  Only after





such application would remaining proceeds, if any, be available to be
distributed to the Holders of Interests.


It is unlikely that the Holders of Interests ever will receive any
further distributions from the Partnership or any further return on their
original investment.  However, it is expected that Holders of Interests
will be allocated a substantial amount of additional gain for Federal and
state income tax purposes as a result of transactions which may occur over
the remaining term of the Partnership.  These transactions include (i) a
sale or other disposition of the 245 Park Avenue property or other
properties in which BFP, LP owns an interest; (ii) a sale or other
disposition of the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP (including a
redemption of the Retained Interest); or (iii) a significant reduction in
the indebtedness of the 245 Park Avenue property or other indebtedness of
the Partnership for Federal and state income tax purposes.  The amount of
gain for Federal and state income tax purposes to be allocated to a Holder
of Interests over the remaining term of the Partnership is expected to be,
at a minimum, equal to all or most of the amount of such Holder's deficit
capital account for tax purposes.  Such gain may be offset by suspended
losses from prior years (if any) that have been allocated to the Holder of
Interests.  The actual tax liability of each Holder of Interests will
depend on such Holder's own tax situation.


The Partnership has no employees.


The terms of transactions between the Partnership and the General
Partners and their affiliates are set forth in Items 11 and 13 below and in
the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, to which reference is
hereby made for a description of such transactions.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



The Partnership is subject to significant risks, including factors
related to its minority position in BFP, LP, its dependency on JMB for
continued advances to fund operations, and its past history of operating
losses.  The Partnership is obligated under a Demand Note which
significantly exceeds its assets and there is substantial uncertainty that
it has the ability to continue as a going concern.  Reference is made to
Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS



None






ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES



The Partnership owns an indirect, minority interest in properties
referred to under Item 1 above to which reference is hereby made.  The
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP is pledged as collateral for Replacement
Note 1 and the Demand Note payable to JMB.






ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



The Partnership is not subject to any material pending legal
proceedings.






ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS



There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of 2005.










PART II






ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SECURITY
HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES



As of January 1, 2006, there were 859 record holders of the remaining
958 Interests outstanding in the Partnership.  There is no public market
for Interests and it is not anticipated that a public market for Interests
will develop.  Consequently, a Holder may not be able to sell or otherwise
liquidate his or her Interests.  In addition, the Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (with certain
exceptions) under state securities laws.  Transfers of the Interests must
be made in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and
are subject to the restrictions on transfers set forth in Article 14 (pages
15-17) of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the
Partnership, which are incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 99 to
this annual report.  A sale or other transfer of an Interest may result in
material adverse Federal income tax consequences.


The Partnership has not made any distributions since 1989.  The
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP is pledged as collateral for Replacement
Note 1 and the Demand Note payable to JMB, which notes require mandatory
payment of principal and interest out of (i) any distributions received
from BFP, LP, and (ii) any net proceeds received upon the sale, refinancing
or other disposition of the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.  Reference
is made to the section entitled "Investment in Unconsolidated Venture" in
the Notes to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7 for a
discussion of the restrictions on the distributions (if any) to the
Partnership from BFP, LP.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Item 7 have the same
meanings as used in Item 1. Business or in the Notes.


The Partnership's future liquidity and ability to continue as a going
concern are dependent upon additional advances from JMB Realty Corporation
("JMB") and there is no assurance that such advances will continue to be
made.  Advances totaling $135,000 and $222,000 were made to the Partnership
from JMB in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  These advances are evidenced by a
demand note ("Demand Note"), dated December 1, 2004, which bears interest
at prime plus 1 percent and is secured by the Partnership's interest in
BFP, LP.  Additional advances totaling $20,000 were made by JMB under the
Demand Note in January 2006.  JMB is under no obligation to make further
advances and has the right to require repayment of the Demand Note together
with accrued and unpaid interest at any time.


The Partnership has an approximate .5% interest in BFP, LP.  Persons
who are interested in obtaining information concerning BFP, LP should be
aware that BPC files periodic reports and other information, which includes
information about BFP, LP and its assets and operations, with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  BPC's filings with the SEC are
available to the public through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system accessible through the SEC's web site at
http://www.sec.gov.  Interested persons also may read and copy any report,
statement or other information that BPC has filed with the SEC at its
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, or
may call the SEC for more information on obtaining information from the
SEC's public reference rooms.  This description is provided for
informational purposes only.  The Partnership does not prepare, and is not
responsible for the preparation of, any of BPC's reports or other
information it files with the SEC including, but not limited to, those
concerning the business and financial results of BFP, LP.  Those reports
and other information are not intended to be incorporated by reference into
this report on Form 10-K, and the Partnership has no responsibility for the
accuracy of any information included in BPC's reports or other information.


BFP, LP has a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding.  Any
proceeds from the sale of the buildings in which BFP, LP has an interest
would be first applied to repayment of the mortgage and other indebtedness
of BFP, LP.  In any event, any net proceeds obtained by the Partnership
could then be available to satisfy Replacement Note 1 and the Demand Note.
Only after such applications would any remaining proceeds be available to
be distributed to the Holders of Interests.  Similarly, in the event of a
sale or other disposition of the Retained Interest (including a redemption
pursuant to an election discussed above), the Partnership's share of the
proceeds of such sale or disposition would be available to satisfy
Replacement Note 1 and the Demand Note.  Only after such application would
remaining proceeds, if any, be available to be distributed to the Holders
of Interests.


It is unlikely that the Holders of Interests ever will receive any
further distributions from the Partnership or any further return on their
original investment.  However, it is expected that Holders of Interests
will be allocated a substantial amount of additional gain for Federal and
state income tax purposes as a result of transactions which may occur over
the remaining term of the Partnership.  These transactions include (i) sale
or other disposition of the 245 Park Avenue property or other properties in
which BFP, LP owns an interest; (ii) a sale or other disposition of the
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP (including a redemption of the Retained
Interest); or (iii) a significant reduction in the indebtedness of the 245
Park Avenue property or other indebtedness of the Partnership for Federal
and state income tax purposes.  Moreover, none of these transactions is
expected to result in Holders of Interests receiving any significant cash





distributions.  The amount of gain for Federal and state income tax
purposes to be allocated to a Holder of Interests over the remaining term
of the Partnership is expected to be, at a minimum, equal to all or most of
the amount of such Holder's deficit capital account for tax purposes.  Such
gain may be offset by suspended losses from prior years (if any) that have
been allocated to the Holder of Interests.  The actual tax liability of
each Holder of Interests will depend on such Holder's own tax situation.



RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT



In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue
No. 04-5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners
as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" (EITF 04-5).  EITF 04-5 is effective
for all newly formed limited partnerships after the consensus was ratified
and January 2006 for all existing limited partnership agreements.  The
Partnership has evaluated the ownership structure of its existing
investment in BFP, LP and again has determined that it does not demonstrate
control over this entity as defined by EITF 04-5.






RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The operations of the Partnership in 2005 and 2004 have been funded
entirely by advances under a demand note from JMB totaling $135,000 and
$222,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively.


The increase in interest and other receivables at December 31, 2005
as compared to December 31, 2004 and the increase in interest and other
income for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 is due to the reversal of an allowance on a
receivable of approximately $43,600, which was received by the Partnership
in January 2006 from a Holder of Interest for previous withholding tax
payments made by the Partnership on behalf of the Holder of Interest.


The increase in demand note payable to an affiliate at December 31,
2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 is due primarily to advances totaling
$135,000 made to the Partnership in 2005 by JMB.


The increase in note payable to an affiliate at December 31, 2005 as
compared to December 31, 2004 is due to interest accrued on the note
payable in 2005.


The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005
as compared to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is primarily due
to the JMB Note split in October 2004 and the resulting decrease in the
Partnership's indebtedness.


The decreases in professional services for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003
is primarily due to decreases in fees for legal and accounting services
related to the partial redemption of the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP
in December 2002.


The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 is
primarily due to the provision for doubtful receivables recognized in 2004.



INFLATION



Due to the low levels of inflation in recent years and the limited
business activity of the Partnership, inflation generally has not had a
material effect on it.






USE OF ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the
overall presentation of the Partnership's financial condition and results
of operations and require management to make difficult, complex or
subjective judgments.  The Partnership made no significant estimates or
assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2005 and thus has concluded
that there are no critical accounting policies.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



The Partners

JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd.:


We have audited the consolidated financial statements of JMB/245 Park
Avenue Associates, Ltd., a limited partnership (the "Partnership"), and
consolidated venture as listed in the accompanying index.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the General
Partners of the Partnership.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by the General Partners of the Partnership, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd. and consolidated venture as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.


The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd. will continue as a going
concern.  As described in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, the Partnership is dependent upon additional advances from JMB
under the demand loan.  This uncertainty and the fact that the Partnership
has a net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern.  The General Partners' plans in regard to
these matters are also described in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

JMB/245 PARK AVENUE ASSOCIATES, LTD.


(A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)



and Consolidated Venture




NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003




OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING




GENERAL



JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd. (the "Partnership"), through JMB
245 Park Avenue Holding Company, LLC ("245 Park Holding"), owns an
approximate .5% general partner interest in Brookfield Financial
Properties, L.P. ("BFP, LP"), formerly known as World Financial Properties,
L.P.  The ownership is represented by 567.375 Class A Units.  BFP, LP is a
joint venture that holds equity investments in commercial office buildings.


Business activities consist of rentals to a variety of commercial companies
and the ultimate sale or disposition of such real estate.  245 Park Holding
is a limited liability company in which the Partnership is a 99% member and
WFP Property G.P. Corp. ("WFP, GP"), which is an affiliate of the managing
general partner of BFP, LP, is a 1% member.  The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and its
majority-owned limited liability company, 245 Park Holding.  The effect of
all transactions between the Partnership and its consolidated venture has
been eliminated.


Because the Partnership has no future funding obligations to BFP, LP,
is currently not expecting to receive distributions from BFP, LP, has no
influence or control over the day-to-day affairs of BFP, LP, and its
investment in BFP, LP has been reduced to less than 1%, the Partnership
discontinued the application of the equity method of accounting, recorded
its investment at zero and no longer recognizes its share of earnings or
losses from BFP, LP.


The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
accounting as adjusted for Federal income tax reporting purposes.  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared from such
records after making appropriate adjustments to reflect the Partnership's
accounts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP") and to consolidate the accounts of 245
Park Holding as described above.  Such GAAP and consolidation adjustments
are not recorded on the records of the Partnership.


The net earnings (loss) per limited partnership interest is based
upon the number of limited partnership interests outstanding at the end of
the period.  Deficit capital accounts will result, through the remaining
duration of the Partnership, in net gain for financial reporting and
Federal and state income tax purposes to the General Partners and Limited
Partners.


The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported or disclosed amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


No provision for Federal or state income taxes has been made as the
liability for such taxes is that of the partners rather than the
Partnership.


The Partnership's future liquidity and ability to continue as a going
concern are dependent upon additional advances from JMB Realty Corporation
("JMB") and there is no assurance that such advances will be made.  JMB is
under no obligation to make further advances and has the right to require
repayment of the Demand Note together with accrued and unpaid interest at
any time.






RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT



In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue
No. 04-5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners
as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" (EITF 04-5).  EITF 04-5 is effective
for all newly formed limited partnerships after the consensus was ratified
and January 2006 for all existing limited partnership agreements.  The
Partnership has evaluated the ownership structure of its existing
investment in BFP, LP and again has determined that it does not demonstrate
control over this entity as defined by EITF 04-5.



INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED VENTURE



In December 1983, the Partnership acquired an interest in 245 Park,
which owned a 46-story office building located at 245 Park Avenue, New
York, New York.  The Partnership acquired its approximate 48.25% ownership
interest in 245 Park for approximately $63,927,000 from an affiliate of the
joint venture partners.  In addition to the Partnership, the other partners
(the "O&Y partners") of 245 Park included Olympia & York 245 Park Ave.
Holding Company, L.P., Olympia & York Equity Company, L.P., and Olympia &
York 245 Corp., all of which were affiliates of Olympia & York
Developments, Ltd. ("O&Y").


As a result of the financial difficulties of the O&Y partners, in
October 1995 each of the O&Y partners and certain other O&Y affiliates (but
not the Joint Venture) filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.   As a result of the plan
of restructuring (the "Plan"), which became effective on November 21, 1996
("Effective Date"), the Partnership owned through JMB 245 Park Avenue
Holding Company, LLC ("245 Park Holding") an approximate 5.4% general
partner interest in Brookfield Financial Properties, L.P. ("BFP, LP"),
formerly known as World Financial Properties, L.P.  The managing general
partner of BFP, LP is not affiliated with the Partnership and, subject to
the partnership agreement of BFP, LP and the JMB Transaction Agreement
(discussed below), has full authority to manage its affairs.  245 Park
Holding is a limited liability company in which the Partnership is a 99%
member and WFP Property G.P. Corp. ("WFP, GP"), which is an affiliate of
the managing general partner of BFP, LP, is a 1% member.


BFP, LP's principal assets are majority and controlling interests in
office buildings, certain of which are owned subject to ground leases of
the underlying land.


As a result of transactions noted below, at December 31, 2005, the
Partnership holds an approximate .5% interest in BFP, LP.  Persons who are
interested in obtaining information concerning BFP, LP should be aware that
BPC files periodic reports and other information, which includes
information about BFP, LP and its assets and operations, with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  BPC's filings with the SEC are
available to the public through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system accessible through the SEC's web site at
http://www.sec.gov.  Interested persons also may read and copy any report,
statement or other information that BPC has filed with the SEC at its
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, or
may call the SEC for more information on obtaining information from the
SEC's public reference rooms.  This description is provided for
informational purposes only.  The Partnership does not prepare, and is not
responsible for the preparation of, any of BPC's reports or other
information it files with the SEC including, but not limited to, those
concerning the business and financial results of BFP, LP.  Those reports
and other information are not intended to be incorporated by reference into
this report on Form 10-K, and the Partnership has no responsibility for the
accuracy of any information included in BPC's reports or other information.





The Partnership's interest in BFP, LP was pledged as collateral for
certain notes payable (collectively "the JMB Notes") which aggregated
approximately $89,337,000 in principal and interest at December 31, 2002,
(immediately prior to repayment), to JMB.  The security agreements for the
JMB Notes required mandatory payment of principal and interest out of any
net proceeds received upon the redemption, refinancing or other disposition
of, or any distribution made with respect to, the Partnership's interest in
BFP, LP.


On December 31, 2002 (the "Redemption Date") 245 Park Holding entered
into a redemption agreement (the "Partial Redemption") by and among 245
Park Holding, WFP, GP and BFP, LP pursuant to which 245 Park Holding
transferred and BFP, LP thereby redeemed approximately 90% of its
approximate 5.4% interest (the "Redeemed Interest"), in BFP, LP, and 245
Park Holding received a distribution of approximately $56,109,000 (the
"Redemption Distribution").  245 Park Holding's remaining interest in BFP,
LP is approximately .5%, represented by 567.375 Class A Units (the
"Retained Interest").  In accordance with the 245 Park Holding limited
liability company agreement, 245 Park Holding distributed approximately
$55,548,000 (99% of the Redemption Distribution) to the Partnership and
approximately $561,000 (1% of the Redemption Distribution) to WFP, GP.  The
Partnership received its share of the Redemption Distribution on the
Redemption Date and in accordance with the security agreements relating to
the JMB Notes, the Partnership then paid to JMB approximately $55,548,000
as repayment toward the JMB Notes.  One JMB Note remained after such
repayment, which was secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.


On October 8, 2004, the Partnership and JMB entered into an agreement
to split the JMB Note (which had an unpaid principal and accrued and
deferred interest balance at October 8, 2004 of approximately $30,531,000)
into two separate replacement notes (the "Replacement Notes"), whereby the
Partnership issued the Replacement Notes payable to JMB that allocated the
outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest under the JMB
Note between the Replacement Notes in the amounts of $3,482,284 of
principal and $385,345 of accrued and unpaid interest to one Replacement
Note ("Replacement Note 1") and $22,017,716 of principal and all other
accrued and all unpaid interest totaling $4,645,531 (including all of the
default interest of $4,631,375) to the second Replacement Note
("Replacement Note 2").  The division of the JMB Note and its replacement
by Replacement Note 1 and Replacement Note 2 resulted in those two notes
superseding the JMB Note.  The security, interest rate and maturity date
for the Replacement Notes remained unchanged from those under the JMB Note.


Through a series of transactions, JMB assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to JMB Park Avenue, Inc., which is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of JMB and the Corporate General Partner of the
Partnership.  Effective October 8, 2004, the Corporate General Partner and
the Partnership entered into an Assignment and Contribution Agreement,
pursuant to which the Corporate General Partner assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to the Partnership as an additional, voluntary
contribution of capital.  This resulted in the release of the Partnership
from liability for repayment of Replacement Note 2 (with aggregate
principal and interest of $26,663,247).  Due to the decrease in the
Partnership's outstanding indebtedness, interest accruals in future periods
will be substantially less.  Replacement Note 1 remains as outstanding
indebtedness of the Partnership owed to JMB and is secured by the
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.  The unpaid principal and accrued
interest balance of Replacement Note 1 at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
$3,961,754 and $3,884,073, respectively.


BFP, LP has had the right to sell the 245 Park Avenue property
without the consent of the Partnership since January 2000.  BFP, LP
notified the Partnership that it sold a 49% interest in the 245 Park Avenue
property to an unaffiliated third party on October 2, 2003.  The
Partnership did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 49% interest
in 245 Park Avenue.  However, as a result of such transaction, a
substantial amount of gain for Federal and state income tax purposes was





allocated to the Holders of Interests without any distribution of cash.
Under certain circumstances, the Partnership may have obligations for
Federal or state withholding or estimated tax payments on behalf of certain
Holders of Interests.  Notwithstanding any such obligations, the
Partnership believes that the Holders of Interests have the ultimate
responsibility for the timely filing of state and Federal tax returns and
the payment of all related taxes, including the reimbursement to the
Partnership of all withholding tax payments or estimated tax payments made
on their behalf.



NOTES PAYABLE TO AN AFFILIATE



Advances totaling $135,000 and $222,000 have been made to the
Partnership from JMB in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  These advances are
evidenced by a demand note ("Demand Note"), dated December 1, 2004, which
bears interest at prime plus 1 percent and is secured by the Partnership's
interest in BFP, LP.


Note payable to an affiliate consists of the following at
December 31, 2005 and 2004:








                                                2005        2004
                                             ----------  ----------
Note payable (term loan) bearing
 interest at 2% per annum, compounded
 annually; secured by the Partnership's
 interest in BFP, LP; no payments until
 December 1998 when the entire principal
 amount and accrued compounded interest
 were scheduled to be due (as discussed
 above); extended, effective January 3,
 2001, to January 2, 2006; note split
 effective October 8, 2004 (as discussed
 above); note balance rolled into
 Demand Note effective January 2, 2006. . .  $3,482,284   3,482,284
                                             ==========  ==========








Accrued and unpaid interest due to an affiliate was $502,866 and
$402,905 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT



Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, net profits and
losses of the Partnership from operations are generally allocated 94% to
the Holders and 6% to the General Partners.  Profits from the sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the Partnership's interest in
BFP, LP or of all or substantially all of the 245 Park Avenue office
building or other real property owned by BFP, LP will be allocated to the
General Partners in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of such profits or
any cash from the proceeds of such sale or other disposition distributed to
the General Partners, plus an additional amount of such profits to
eliminate deficits, if any, in the General Partners' capital accounts.  The
remainder of such profits will be allocated to the Holders.  All losses
from the sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership's interest in
BFP, LP or of all or substantially all of the 245 Park Avenue office
building or other real property owned by BFP, LP will be allocated 99% to
the Holders and 1% to the General Partners.  All such profits or losses
will be allocated among the Holders in proportion to the number of
Interests held.  For Federal income tax purposes, all interest expense
recognized on the JMB Notes is allocated to a General Partner.


The General Partners are not required to make any additional capital
contributions except under certain limited circumstances upon dissolution
and termination of the Partnership.  Distributions of "Distributable Cash"
(as defined) of the Partnership generally will be made 94% to the Holders
of Interest and 6% to the General Partners.  Distributions of "Sale
Proceeds" or "Financing Proceeds" (as defined) will be made first to the





Holders in an amount equal to their contributed capital, next to the
General Partners in an amount equal to their capital contributions, and the
balance 70% to the Holders and 30% to the General Partners.  Distributions
would be made to the General Partners and Holders of Interests generally
only after the satisfaction of all Partnership liabilities.



TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

to engage in various transactions involving the Corporate General Partner
and its affiliates including the reimbursement for salaries and salary-
related expenses of its employees, certain of its officers, and other

and reported within the time period specified in the applicable rules and
form of the Securities and Exchange Commission for this report.  The
Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures do not include the

ability to control.







PART III






ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT



The Corporate General Partner of the Partnership, JMB Park Avenue,
Inc., an Illinois corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMB
Investment Holdings - I, Inc., a Delaware corporation.  All of the
outstanding shares of stock of JMB Investment Holdings - I, Inc. are owned,
indirectly, by JMB Realty Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("JMB") in
the business of real estate investment.  Substantially all of the shares of
JMB are owned, directly or indirectly, by certain of its current and former
officers and directors, members of their families and their affiliates.
The Corporate General Partner has responsibility for all aspects of the
Partnership's operations, subject to the requirement that the sale of all
or substantially all of the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP or of all or
substantially all of the 245 Park Avenue office building, unless required
by the terms of the BFP, LP venture agreement, must be approved by the
Associate General Partner of the Partnership, Park Associates, L.P., an
Illinois limited partnership with JMB Park Avenue, Inc. as the sole general
partner.  The limited partners of the Associate General Partner are
generally JMB, current or former officers and directors of JMB, their
affiliates and current or former officers of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Incorporated.


The Partnership is subject to certain conflicts of interest arising
out of its relationships with the General Partners and their affiliates as
well as the fact that affiliates of the General Partners are engaged in a
range of real estate activities.  Certain services have been and may in the
future be provided to the Partnership by affiliates of the General
Partners, including administrative services.  In general, such services are
to be provided on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than could be
obtained from independent third parties and are otherwise subject to
conditions and restrictions contained in the Partnership Agreement.  The
Partnership Agreement permits the General Partners and their affiliates to
provide services to, and otherwise deal and do business with, persons who
may be engaged in transactions with the Partnership, and permits the
Partnership to borrow from, purchase goods and services from, and otherwise





to do business with, persons doing business with the General Partners or
their affiliates.  The General Partners and their affiliates may be in
competition with the Partnership or its investment properties under certain
circumstances, including for tenants for properties and/or for the sale of
properties.  Because the timing and amount of cash distributions and
profits and losses of the Partnership may be affected by various
determinations by the General Partners under the Partnership Agreement,
including whether and when to sell (or consent to the sale of)  investment
property, the establishment and maintenance of reasonable reserves, the
timing of expenditures and the allocation of certain tax items under the
Partnership Agreement, the General Partners may have a conflict of interest
with respect to such determinations.  The General Partners and their
affiliates may also have a conflict of interest with respect to matters
relating to the remaining JMB Note, including, among other things, the
enforcement of repayment of that note and the remedies available to JMB in
the event of a default under that note, as well as with respect to matters
concerning whether to continue to advance funds to the Partnership to
permit it to pay its expenses.  Reference is made to the discussions under
"Investment in Unconsolidated Venture" and "Notes Payable to an Affiliate"
in the Notes for further information concerning the term loan and demand
notes.


The names, current positions and length of service therein of the
director and executive officers of the Corporate General Partner of the
Partnership are as follows:








                                                        SERVED IN

----                      ------                        ------------
Gary Nickele              Vice President                12/18/90
Patrick J. Meara          President and Director        12/22/00
H. Rigel Barber           Vice President                03/26/84
Gailen J. Hull            Vice President                03/26/84








There is no family relationship among any of the foregoing director
or officers.  The foregoing director has been elected to serve a term until
the annual meeting of the Corporate General Partner to be held on August 8,
2006.  All of the foregoing officers have been elected to serve terms until
the first meeting of the Board of Directors held after the annual meeting
of the Corporate General Partner to be held on August 8, 2006.  There are
no arrangements or understandings between or among any of said director or
officers and any other person pursuant to which any director or officer was
elected as such.


The foregoing director and officers are also officers and/or
directors of JMB and various companies affiliated with JMB.


The business experience during the past five years of each such
director and officer of the Corporate General Partner of the Partnership
includes the following:


Gary Nickele (age 53) is Executive Vice President and General Counsel
of JMB and an officer and/or director of various JMB affiliates.  Mr.
Nickele has been associated with JMB since February 1984.  He holds a J.D.
degree from the University of Michigan Law School and is a member of the
Bar of the State of Illinois.


Patrick J. Meara (age 43) has been a Senior Vice President of JMB
since January 1997.  Prior to becoming President and Director of the
Corporate General Partner, Mr. Meara was a Vice President of the Corporate

Park Avenue, Inc., has acted as the Chief Financial Officer of the
Partnership since August 2002.  He also is Senior Vice President and, since
August 2002, Chief Financial Officer of JMB and an officer of various JMB
affiliates.  Mr. Hull has been associated with JMB since March, 1982.  He
holds a Masters degree in Business Administration from Northern Illinois
University and is a Certified Public Accountant.


The Partnership is a limited partnership organized under the laws of
the State of Illinois, and the rights of its partners and Holders of
Interests are governed by its Partnership Agreement.  Moreover, the
Interests are not publicly traded.  In view of these facts, as well as the
limited business activity of the Partnership, the Corporate General Partner
has determined that it is not necessary for the Partnership to have either
an "audit committee financial expert" or a "code of ethics" as those terms
are defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.






ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



The officers and the director of the Corporate General Partner
receive no direct remuneration in such capacities from the Partnership.
The General Partners are entitled to receive a share of cash distributions,
when and as cash distributions are made to the Holders of Interests, and a
share of profits or losses as described under the section entitled
"Partnership Agreement" in the Notes.  No such cash distributions were paid
to the General Partners in 2005.  The General Partners are expected to be
allocated loss for tax purposes in 2005.

and one Interest owned by an estate for which such officer acts as co-executor and is deemed to have shared
investment and voting power.

     No executive officer or director of the Corporate General Partner of the Partnership possesses a right to
acquire beneficial ownership of Interests of the Partnership.

     Reference is made to Item 10 for information concerning ownership of the Corporate General Partner.

     (c)   There exists no arrangement, known to the Partnership, the operation of which may at a subsequent date
result in a change in control of the Partnership.

     (d)   The Partnership has no compensation plans or individual compensation arrangements under which equity
securities of the Partnership are authorized for issuance to any person.















ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS



Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is permitted
to engage in various transactions involving affiliates of the Corporate
General Partner of the Partnership.  Such transactions may involve
conflicts of interest for the General Partners or their affiliates,
including, among others, those discussed in Item 10. Directors and
Executive Officers above.  Various relationships of the Partnership to the
Corporate General Partner (and its director and executive officers) and its
affiliates are also set forth above in Item 10.


The General Partners of the Partnership or their affiliates may be
reimbursed for their direct expenses and out-of-pocket expenses relating to
the administration of the Partnership and operation of the Partnership's
real property investments.  There were no such reimbursable expenses in
2005.


The General Partners and their affiliates are entitled to
reimbursements of salary and salary related expenses for legal, accounting
and certain other services.  Such reimbursements will not exceed the lesser
of the actual cost of such services or the amount which the Partnership
would be required to pay independent parties for comparable services.  For
2005, affiliates of the General Partners were entitled to reimbursements
for such expenses in the amount of $6,465 of which $434 was payable at
December 31, 2005.


Advances totaling $135,000 and $222,000 were made to the Partnership
from JMB in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  These advances are evidenced by a
demand note dated December 1, 2004, which bears interest at prime plus 1
percent and is secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.
Additional advances totaling $20,000 were made by JMB under the Demand Note
in January 2006.  JMB is under no obligation to make further advances and
has the right to require repayment of the Demand Note together with accrued
and unpaid interest at any time.


At December 31, 2003, the Partnership was indebted to JMB Realty
Corporation ("JMB") under the JMB Note for an aggregate amount of
$30,131,375 (consisting of $25,500,000 of principal and $4,631,375 of
accrued and unpaid interest, including default interest.)  On October 8,
2004, the Partnership and JMB entered into an agreement to split the JMB
Note (which had an unpaid principal and accrued and deferred interest
balance at October 8, 2004 of approximately $30,531,000) into two separate
replacement notes (the "Replacement Notes") payable to JMB so that the
outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest under the JMB
Note was allocated between the Replacement Notes.  One of the Replacement
Notes ("Replacement Note 1") received a principal balance of $3,482,284 and
accrued and unpaid interest of $385,345.  The other Replacement Note
("Replacement Note 2") received a principal balance of $22,017,716 and all
other accrued and unpaid interest from the JMB Note totaling $4,645,531
(including all of the default interest of $4,631,375).  The security,
interest rate and maturity date for the Replacement Notes remained
unchanged from those under the JMB Note.


Through a series of transactions, JMB assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to JMB Park Avenue, Inc., which is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of JMB and the Corporate General Partner of the
Partnership.  Effective October 8, 2004, the Corporate General Partner and
the Partnership entered into an Assignment and Contribution Agreement,
pursuant to which the Corporate General Partner assigned and contributed
Replacement Note 2 to the Partnership as an additional, voluntary
contribution of capital.  This resulted in the release of the Partnership
from liability for repayment of Replacement Note 2 (with aggregate
principal and interest of $26,663,247).  Due to the decrease in the
Partnership's outstanding indebtedness, interest accruals in future periods





will be substantially less.  All accounts and interests of the Corporate
General Partner in the Partnership are adjusted to reflect this
contribution of capital.  Replacement Note 1 remains as outstanding
indebtedness of the Partnership owed to JMB and is secured by the
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP.  The unpaid principal and accrued
interest balances of Replacement Note 1 at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
$3,961,754 and $3,884,073, respectively.






ITEM 14.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES



The Partnership has not adopted any pre-approval policies and
procedures.  All audit and permitted non-audit services are approved by the
sole director of the Corporate General Partner of the Partnership before
the service is undertaken.


The aggregate fees billed for professional services by KPMG LLP for
2005 and 2004 for these various services were:








Type of Fees                                    2005         2004
------------                                  --------     --------

                                              ========     ========








In the above table, in accordance with the SEC's definitions and
rules, "audit fees" are fees the Partnership paid KPMG LLP for professional
services for the audit of the Partnership's consolidated financial
statements included in Form 10-K and review of financial statements
included in Form 10-Qs, and for services that are normally provided by the
accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or
engagements; "tax fees" are fees for tax compliance, tax advice and tax

EXHIBIT 99




14.  ASSIGNMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERS' INTERESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP


(a)   No Limited Partner shall assign, transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of his Interest otherwise than in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 14, and any such purported
assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition which is not
authorized by this Section 14 shall not be effective for any purpose.


(b)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 14(e) and 14(f)hereof,
any Limited Partner at any time and from time to time shall have the right
to assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of all or any part of
his Interest to, or in trust for the benefit of, any Person, but no such
assignee shall be or become a substituted Limited Partner except in
accordance with Sections 14(c) and 14(d) hereof.  Any Limited Partner so
assigning all or part of his Interest is hereinafter called the "Assigning
Limited Partner".


(c)   The Corporate General Partner may (but need not), in its sole
discretion, consent to the appointment of an assignee of transferee
(whether such assignee or transferee has acquired his interest in the
Partnership by virtue of a voluntary assignment pursuant to Section 14(b)
hereof, an involuntary transfer or a transfer by operation of law) of an
Interest (or a part thereof) of a Limited Partner as a substituted Limited
Partner in the Partnership entitled to all the rights and benefits of the
Assigning Limited Partner under this Agreement; but no such assignee or
transferee shall be or become a Limited Partner unless and until such
assignee or transferee satisfies all conditions of this Section 14 and
unless and until the Corporate General Partner in writing designates and
appoints such person as a substituted Limited Partner.  Notwithstanding the
time at which such conditions shall have been satisfied, any assignee of an
Interest (or a part thereof) shall be recognized as a holder of Interests
as of the first day of the fiscal quarter next succeeding the fiscal
quarter in which such assignment occurs.  The Partners hereby consent and
agree to such designation and appointment of a substituted Limited Partner
by the Corporate General Partner, and agree that the Corporate General
Partner may, on behalf of each Partner and on behalf of the Partnership,
cause the Certificate of Limited Partnership of this Partnership to be
appropriately amended.


(d)   Each substituted Limited Partner, as a condition to his
admission as a Limited Partner, shall execute and acknowledge (including
swearing to) such instruments (including,  without limitation, the power of
attorney required by Section 16 hereof), in form and substance satisfactory
to the Corporate General Partner, as the Corporate General Partner shall
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to effectuate such admission and to
confirm the agreement of the substituted Limited Partner to be bound by all
the terms and provisions of this Agreement with respect to the Interest (or
portion thereof) acquired.  All reasonable expenses, including attorneys'
fees, incurred by the Partnership in connection with the transfer and
substitution shall be paid by such substituted Limited Partner.


(e)   Anything in this Section 14 or elsewhere in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other
disposition to a minor or incompetent of all or any part of any Limited
Partner's Interest in the Partnership shall be made or shall be effective,
and further, no assignment, transfer, encumbrance, or other disposition of
all or any part of any Limited Partner's Interest shall be made or shall be
effective if such assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition
would (in the opinion of the Partnership's legal counsel, which shall be
conclusive for this purpose) result in the termination of the Partnership
for purposes of the then applicable provisions of the United States
Internal Revenue Code.


(f)   Anything in this Section 14 or elsewhere in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other
disposition of all or any part of any Limited Partner's Interest in the
Partnership shall be made or shall be effective unless (i) prior to the
consummation thereof, all assignees and transferees with respect thereto
shall have made to the Partnership in writing all of the representations
set out in Sections 12(a), 12(b) and 12(c) of this Agreement, (ii) the
General Partners' grant their consent (which may be withheld in their sole
discretion) to such assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition
and (iii) if required in the discretion of the General Partners, the
Partnership is provided with an opinion of its legal counsel, or other
legal counsel satisfactory to the Partnership's counsel, stating that such
assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition is exempt from the
Securities Act of 1933 and is permissible under all other applicable
Federal and state securities laws without registration or qualification of
any security or any Person.





(g)   Each Assigning Limited Partner, substituted Limited Partner and
each assignee of any Interest (or portion thereof) shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Partnership, every General Partner, every partner, officer,
director, employee or Affiliate of a General Partner and every other
Limited Partner who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of or arising
from any actual or alleged misrepresentation, misstatement of facts or
omission to state facts made (or omitted to be made) by such Assigning
Limited Partner, substituted Limited Partner or assignee of an Interest (or
portion thereof) in connection with any assignment, transfer, encumbrance
or other disposition of all or any part of any Interest in the Partnership,
against expenses for which the Partnership or such other Person has not
otherwise been reimbursed (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by it or him
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding; provided, however, that
the foregoing indemnification shall not be valid as to any Partner who
supplied the information which gave rise to any actual material
misrepresentation, misstatement of facts or omission to state facts.


(h)   In the event a vote of the Limited Partners shall be taken
pursuant to this Agreement for any reason, a Limited Partner shall, solely
for the purpose of determining the Interest held by him in weighing his
vote, be deemed the holder of any Interest assigned in part by him in
respect of which the assignee has not become a substituted Limited Partner.


If the assignor of such Limited Partnership Interest has transferred his
entire Interest, however, and the assignee of such Interest has not become
a substituted Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 14, then neither the
assignor of such Interest nor the assignee shall have any voting rights in
the Partnership until such time as the assignee becomes a substituted
Limited Partner.


(i)   In determining the ownership of any Interest for purposes of
any distribution pursuant to Sections 11 or 13 hereof or allocation of
profits or losses pursuant to Section 9 hereof, any such distribution shall
be to the Person recognized as the holder of the Interest (or portion
thereof) pursuant to Section 14(c) hereof as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter with respect to which such distribution is made and any such
allocation of profits or losses shall be made to the Person recognized as
the holder of the Interest (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 14(c)
hereof as of the last day of the quarterly period in which the Partnership
recognized such profits or losses for tax purposes.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

 

June 30,
2011 and 2010

(Unaudited)

 

 

General

 

Readers of
this quarterly report should refer to the Partnership's audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010,
which are included in the Partnership's 2010 Annual Report on Form
10-K (File No. 0-13545) filed on March 15, 2011, as certain
footnote disclosures which would substantially duplicate those
contained in such audited financial statements have been omitted
from this report. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
quarterly report have the same meanings as in the Partnership's
2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

JMB/245
Park Avenue Associates, Ltd. (the "Partnership"), through JMB 245
Park Avenue Holding Company, LLC ("245 Park Holding"), owns an
approximate .5% general partner interest in Brookfield Financial
Properties, L.P. ("BFP, LP"), formerly known as World Financial
Properties, L.P. The ownership is represented by 567.375 Class A
Units. BFP, LP is a limited partnership that holds equity
investments in commercial office buildings, certain of which are
owned subject to ground leases of the underlying land. Business
activities consist primarily of rentals to a variety of commercial
tenants and the ultimate sale or disposition of such real estate.
245 Park Holding is a limited liability company in which the
Partnership is a 99% member and BFP Property GP Corp. ("BFP GP"),
which is an affiliate of the managing general partner of BFP, LP,
is a 1% member. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Partnership and its majority-owned
limited liability company, 245 Park Holding. The effect of all
transactions between the Partnership and its consolidated venture
has been eliminated.

 

The
Partnership has no future funding obligations to BFP, LP. In
addition, the Partnership has not received distributions from BFP,
LP, has no indication from BFP, LP that it intends to make
distributions in the future, has no influence or control over the
day-to-day affairs of BFP, LP, and its investment in BFP, LP has
been reduced to less than 1%. Accordingly, the Partnership
discontinued the application of the equity method of accounting,
recorded its investment at zero, and no longer recognizes its share
of earnings or losses from BFP, LP.

 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported or disclosed amount of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

The
Partnership's future liquidity and ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon additional cash advances from JMB Realty
Corporation ("JMB") and there is no assurance that such advances
will be made. JMB's advances, as well as consolidated balances from
prior notes, are evidenced by a demand note (the "Demand Note"),
dated December 1, 2004, which Demand Note is secured by the
Partnership's indirect interest in BFP, LP. JMB is under no
obligation to make further advances and has the right to require
repayment of the Demand Note together with accrued and unpaid
interest at any time. This uncertainty and the fact that the
Partnership has a net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt
about the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern. No
adjustments to these consolidated financial statements for this
uncertainty have been made.

 

Transactions
with Affiliates

 

The
operations of the Partnership since 2005 have been funded entirely
by cash advances from JMB which totaled $1,477,000 as of June 30,
2011 ($90,000 of which was funded during the six months ended June
30, 2011) and which, together with the amount owed and rolled over
from prior notes, are evidenced by the Demand Note. No additional
cash advances were made by JMB under the Demand Note in July 2011.
The Demand Note, which had an outstanding balance of unpaid
principal and accrued interest at June 30, 2011 of $7,402,615,
accrues interest at prime plus 1 percent, 4.25% at June 30, 2011,
with interest compounded quarterly and included in principal, and
is secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP, LP. JMB is under
no obligation to make further advances and has the right to require
repayment of the Demand Note together with accrued and unpaid
interest at any time.

 

In
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, the Corporate General
Partner and its affiliates are entitled to receive payment or
reimbursement for direct expenses and out-of-pocket expenses
related to the administration of the Partnership and operation of
the Partnership's real property investment. Additionally, the
Corporate General Partner and its affiliates are entitled to
reimbursements for portfolio management, legal and accounting
services. The Partnership incurred costs of $5,558 and $20,574 for
the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for
these services. The Partnership owed the Corporate General Partner
and its affiliates $6,000 for these services at June 30,
2011.

 

Any
reimbursable amounts currently payable to the Corporate General
Partner and their affiliates do not bear interest.

 

Adjustments

 

In the
opinion of the Corporate General Partner, all adjustments
(consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a
fair presentation (assuming the Partnership continues as a going
concern) have been made to the accompanying financial statements as
of June 30, 2011 and 2010, and for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011 and 2010.

The
Partnership's future liquidity and ability to continue as a going
concern are dependent upon additional cash advances from JMB and
there is no assurance that such advances will continue to be made.
This uncertainty and the fact that the Partnership has a net
capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about the Partnership's
ability to continue as a going concern. The operations of the
Partnership since 2005 have been funded entirely by cash advances
from JMB which totaled $1,477,000 as of June 30, 2011 ($90,000 of
which was funded during the six months ended June 30, 2011)
and which, together with the amount owed and rolled over from prior
notes, are evidenced by the Demand Note. No additional cash
advances were made by JMB under the Demand Note in July 2011. The
Demand Note, which had an outstanding balance of unpaid principal
and accrued interest at June 30, 2011 of $7,402,615, accrues
interest at prime plus 1 percent, with interest compounded
quarterly and included in principal, and is secured by the
Partnership's interest in BFP, LP. JMB is under no obligation to
make further advances and has the right to require repayment of
advances previously made together with accrued and unpaid interest
at any time. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern.

 

BFP, LP
has the right to sell the BFP 245 Interest and any of its other
assets without the consent of the Partnership. Under certain
circumstances, the Partnership may have obligations for Federal or
state withholding or estimated tax payments on behalf of certain
Holders of Interests. Notwithstanding any such obligations, the
Partnership believes that the Holders of Interests have the
ultimate responsibility for the timely filing of state and Federal
tax returns and the payment of all related taxes, including the
reimbursement to the Partnership of all withholding tax payments or
estimated tax payments made on their behalf.
