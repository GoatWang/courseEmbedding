By Dan Barufaldi
Structurally, a hedge fund has some similarities to a mutual fund. For example, just like a mutual fund, a hedge fund is a pooled investment vehicle that makes investments in equities, bonds, options and a variety of other securities. It can also be run by a separate manager, much like a sub-advisor runs a mutual fund that is distributed by a large mutual fund company. That, however, is basically where the similarities end. The range of investment strategies available to hedge funds and the types of positions they can take are quite broad and in many cases, very complex. We will focus on specific strategies later in this tutorial, so for now we'll focus on how hedge funds are structured.
Organizational StructureThe typical hedge fund structure is really a two-tiered organization. Figure 1: Hedge Fund Organizational Structure Source: Investopedia, 2009. The general/limited partnership model is the most common structure for the pool of investment funds that make up a hedge fund. In this structure, the general partner assumes responsibility for the operations of the fund, while limited partners can make investments into the partnership and are liable only for their paid-in amounts. As a rule, a general/limited partnership must have at least one GP and one LP, but can have multiple GPs and many LPs. There is an SEC rule, however, that generally limits investors to 99 in order to be excluded from SEC registration. (Learn more about the SEC in Policing The Securities Market: An Overview Of The SEC.)The second component of the two-tiered structure is the structure of the general partnership. The typical structure used for the general partner is a limited liability company. An LLC is very similar to a subchapter S corporation in that it is a flow-through tax entity and investors are limited in liability to the amount of their investment. The general partner's responsibility is to market and manage the fund, and perform any functions necessary in the normal course of business, including hiring a fund manager (oftentimes a related company) and managing the administration of the fund's operations.Fee StructureHedge funds also differ quite radically from mutual funds in how they charge fees. Their fee structure is one of the main reasons why talented money managers decide to open their own hedge funds to begin with. Not only are the fees paid by investors higher than they are for mutual funds, they include some additional fees that mutual funds don't even charge.Management FeeThe management fee for a hedge fund is for the same service that the management fee covers in mutual funds. The difference is that hedge funds typically charge a management fee of 2% of assets managed – and in some cases even higher, if the manager is in high demand and has had a very good track record. This fee alone makes managing a hedge fund attractive, but it is the next fee that really makes it a profitable endeavor for good fund managers.Incentive FeeMost if not all hedge funds charge an incentive fee of anywhere between 10-20% of fund profits, and some hedge funds have even gone as high as 50%. The idea of the incentive fee is to reward the hedge fund manager for good performance, and if the fund's performance is attractive enough, investors are willing to pay this fee. For example, if a hedge fund manager generates a 20% return per year, after management fee, the hedge fund manager will collect 4% of those profits, leaving the investor with a 16% net return. In many cases, this is an attractive return despite the high incentive fee, but with more mediocre managers entering the industry in search of fortune, investors have more often than not been disappointed with net returns on many funds.There is one caveat to the incentive fee, however. A manager only collects an incentive fee for profits exceeding the fund's previous high, called a high-water mark. This means that if a fund loses 5% from its previous high, the manager will not collect an incentive fee until he or she has first made up the 5% loss. In addition, some managers must clear a hurdle rate, such as the return on U.S. Treasuries, before they collect any incentive fees.Hedge funds often follow the so-called "two and twenty" structure – where managers receive 2% of net asset value managed and 20% of profits, though as mentioned, these fees can vary among hedge funds. (For tips on paying fewer fees, see Stop Paying High Mutual Fund Fees.)Term StructureThe terms offered by a hedge fund are so unique that each fund can be completely different from another, but they usually are based on the following factors: Subscriptions and RedemptionsHedge funds do not have daily liquidity like mutual funds do. Some hedge funds can have subscriptions and redemptions monthly, while others accept them only quarterly. The terms of each hedge fund should be consistent with the underlying strategy being used by the manager. The more liquid the underlying investments, the more frequent the subscription/redemption terms should be. Each fund also specifies the number of days required for redemption, ranging from 15 days to 180 days, and this too should be consistent with the underlying strategy. Requiring redemption notices allows the hedge fund manager to efficiently raise capital to cover cash needs.Lock-UpsSome funds require up to a two-year "lock-up" commitment, but the most common lock-up is limited to one year. In some cases, it could be a hard lock, preventing the investor from withdrawing funds for the full time period, while in other cases, an investor can withdraw funds before the expiration of the lock-up period provided they pay a penalty. This second form of lock-up is called a soft lock and the penalty can range from 2-10% in some extreme cases.ConclusionThere are a variety of different combinations that can be used to structure a hedge fund and its related companies and investors. The above summary briefly describes one very common method used to structure the hedge fund and its management company. There are many others and just as hedge funds are creative with their investment strategies, they can also be very creative with their organizational structure. The takeaway of this section is to stress that each corporate structure is unique and should be evaluated along with all other factors covered in the rest of this tutorial.

Convertible Bonds

Convertible bonds offer the potential for equity-like returns but with lower volatility, combined with the security and capital protection characteristics provided by a bond investment. An allocation to convertibles can enhance your portfolio’s risk/reward characteristics.
We take a fundamental, benchmark-agnostic approach to managing convertible bonds. Our active management style and rigorous investment process offer investors a lower-volatility strategy with compelling alpha generation potential.
Issuers of convertibles range from smaller growth companies to some of the largest, most recognisable companies in the world. Our portfolio comprises a wide spectrum of sectors and credits.

Emerging Markets

For investors, higher secular growth rates and spread pick-up in emerging countries and corporates are characteristics that can offer a compelling risk/return profile relative to developed markets.
BlueBay evaluates historical data, but places greater emphasis on forward-looking risk, which could be driven by socio-political developments, policy decisions, economic data surprises or regulatory changes.
We have invested in this asset class since 2002, and offer active long only, total return and hedge fund solutions across sovereign and corporate debt, in both hard and local currency.

Investment Grade

Investment grade-rated debt typically represents a large portion of the institutional investor's portfolio. This is based on the belief that exposure to higher-quality issuers will result in a relatively low default risk compared to other asset classes, while providing the potential for excess returns over cash.
BlueBay is an active manager with a broad understanding of the investment grade universe in both corporate and government debt. Research-driven, fundamental analysis shapes our ideas. This allows us to construct portfolios that aim to minimise credit risk while seeking to generate compelling returns by expressing investment ideas and themes across the risk spectrum.

Leveraged Finance

We offer a variety of strategies providing exposure to the global leveraged finance markets
Our research-driven, fundamental approach to security selection emphasises capital preservation with a focus on downside mitigation. In our view, the avoidance of corporate decline – and ultimately defaults – is essential to ensuring we achieve our goal of compelling, risk-adjusted returns throughout the credit cycle for our clients.
Since 2002, we have developed a broad spectrum of long-only and alternative investment strategies with varying liquidity profiles. Our expertise and long-standing track record across leveraged finance covers high yield bonds, syndicated loans, mezzanine finance, distressed debt and direct lending.

Multi-Asset Credit

Multi-asset credit provides the ability to capture returns in attractive conditions, while seeking to provide downside protection when markets turn. We believe this strategy represents an attractive risk/return profile.
Our expertise across the fixed income spectrum and diverse investment styles means we can harness ideas across investment grade, global high yield, loans, convertible bonds and emerging markets.
The strategy is managed by the internal Asset Allocation Committee, which comprises a team of senior investment professionals. The Committee meets monthly to make asset allocation decisions, placing a high priority on capital preservation.
