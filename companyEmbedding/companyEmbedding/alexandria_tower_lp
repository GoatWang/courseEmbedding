Neighborhood - Koreatown








Koreatown






As the name suggests, the atmosphere in Koreatown is heavily influenced by Korean culture, and it is a favorite destination among foodies city-wide for its endless selection of authentic Korean restaurants.  But the community has a much more diverse character than that: The broad range of cultural influences is exemplified in landmarks like the synagogue/contemporary art gallery of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the Latin fusion cuisine of Roy Choi’s restaurants, and the popular German/Korean/Hawaiian tinged gastropub, Biergarten.

As one of the most popular sections of LA during Hollywood’s golden age, many historic buildings, bars, and restaurants have been preserved or restored to transport patrons to another time—in fact, the interiors of several local eateries were used as locations for the 1960s-set TV series, “Mad Men.
