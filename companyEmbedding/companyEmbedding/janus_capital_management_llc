History[edit]
Janus was founded in 1969 by Tom Bailey. A controlling interest was purchased by Kansas City Southern Industries in 1984. Bailey stepped down as president and CEO in June 2002.[3]
The firm was formerly known as Stilwell Financial Incorporated. The company was renamed following the January 2003 merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial.[4]
The Janus Fund opened in 1970 with approximately $500,000,000.35 in assets and 30 investors.[5] Its primary business was U.S. large cap growth equity management.
Further funds were launched in 1985, including the Janus Venture Fund, its first small cap equity fund, and the Janus Twenty Fund, its first concentrated equity fund. At the same time, Janus began managing assets for institutional clients.
In 1991, Janus launched a number of other new types of fund, including its first global equity fund, the Janus Worldwide Fund, its first international equity fund, the Janes Overseas Fund, and its first mid cap equity fund, the Janus Enterprise Fund. It also launched the Janus Aspen Series (JAS), a product line created for investors wanting to invest in Janus through variable insurance contracts or certain qualified retirement plans. Janus also became available through fund supermarkets for both retail shareholders and financial planners.
Myron Scholes, Nobel laureate and Ph.D., joined Janus as chief investment strategist on July 8, 2014[6] On September 26, 2014, Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus as manager of the Janus global unconstrained bond strategy. In October 2014, Janus acquired VS Holdings, a company based in Darien, Connecticut, and its VelocityShares business.[7] In July 2015, Janus acquired a majority interest in Kapstream Capital, a fixed income specialist.[8] In February 2016, Janus launched a small cap growth and small cap/mid cap growth ETF, [9] followed in June by four new ETFs around investment themes – long-term care, health and fitness, organic foods and personal care (including health care issues related to obesity). On October 3, 2016, Janus Capital Group Inc and Henderson Group plc announced a recommended merger of equals to create Janus Henderson.[10]

                Janus Capital Management (JNS): A Profile of People and Products            


    By Prableen Bajpai, CFA (ICFAI) | Updated November 16, 2015 — 4:00 PM EST    






Share


















































Denver-based Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JNS) provides asset management services to individual investors and institutions. Its subsidiaries managed $183.1 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2014. Locations outside of the United States can be found in London, Milan, Munich, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Melbourne, Paris, The Hague, Zurich, Frankfurt, Dubai and Taipei.
Formally known as Stilwell Financial Inc., Janus was founded in 1969 by Tom Bailey, a young entrepreneur who launched the firm's flagship Janus Fund (JANDX) with just a handful of investors. Janus Capital Group was created following the merger of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company Stilwell Financial in 2003.
Fund Lineup
Janus Capital's subsidiaries consist of Janus Capital Management LLC, INTECH Investment Management LLC, Perkins Investment Management LLC and VelocityShares LLC. Each of them lends a unique perspective and expertise. Janus Capital Management is strongly research driven. INTECH uses a purely mathematical approach to equity investing and has managed institutional portfolios since 1987. Perkins manages small, mid and large-cap value institutional separate accounts as well as mutual funds. (For more, see: Separately Managed Accounts: A Mutual Fund Alternative).
Janus entered the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space only recently when it acquired the parent of VelocityShares, VS Holdings Inc. in October 2014. The company is a specialist in ETFs and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). (For more, see: 2015's Most Promising ETFs).
While Janus offers a variety of funds its roots are research-driven equity and income funds. Through its subsidiaries Janus offers 45 funds. The lineup includes the following strategies: asset allocation, growth, specialty growth, core, value, alternative, international and global, bond and money market funds. The flagship mutual fund, the Janus Fund (JANDX), is a classic large cap growth fund and has $8.2 million in assets under management. (For more, see: What Funds Does Janus Have?). 
Its funds are sold through financial advisors and financial intermediaries and to institutional investors and directly to retail investors.
Star Additions
In 2014 Janus landed two big names in the financial world. Myron Scholes joined the firm as as chief investment strategist. An American economist he won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics along with Robert Merton for their method of pricing stock options, the Black-Scholes Model.
Later in the year legendary fixed income manager Bill Gross  left Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO) to manage Janus' Global Unconstrained Bond Fund (JUCDX). Gross, often referred to as the king of bonds, co-founded fixed-income giant PIMCO in 1971 and managed PIMCO’s flagship PIMCO Total Return Fund (PTTAX). The Global Unconstrained Bond Fund debuted in May of 2014 with assets of $79 million. By January of 2015 assets under management had grown to $1.4 billion. (For more, see: What Bill Gross's Arrival Means to Janus Capital).
The Bottom Line
Janus has come a long way since the launch of its flagship Janus Fund more than 40 years ago. It has grown and evolved into a global asset manager, adding bond and alternative funds to diversify its equity-dominant line up. But along the way Janus hasn't strayed from its research-driven approach. 
Disclaimer: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned funds or stocks.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
