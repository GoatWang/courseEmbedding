Limited Partnership - LP

What is 'Limited Partnership - LP'
A limited partnership (LP) exists when two or more partners unite to jointly conduct a business in which one or more of the partners is liable only to the extent of the amount of money that partner has invested. Limited partners do not receive dividends, but enjoy direct access to the flow of income and expenses. This term is also referred to as a "limited liability partnership" (LLP). The main advantage to this structure is that the owners are typically not liable for the debts of the company.

BREAKING DOWN 'Limited Partnership - LP'
Generally, a partnership is a business that is owned by two or more individuals. There are three forms of partnerships: general partnership, joint venture and limited partnership. The three forms differ in various aspects, but they share similar features.Similarities of Limited Partnership With Other Forms of PartnershipsIn all forms of partnerships, each partner is required to contribute resources such as property, money, skill or labor in exchange for sharing in the profits and losses of the business. At least one partner is involved in making decisions regarding the day-to-day affairs of the business.Though not a legal requirement, all partnerships require a partnership agreement that specifies how to make business decisions. These decisions include how to split profits or losses, resolve conflicts and alter ownership structure, as well as how to close the business, if necessary.Differences Between Limited Partnership and Other Forms of PartnershipA general partnership is the one in which all profits, managerial responsibilities and liability for debts are shared in equal proportion among the partners. If they plan to share profits or losses unequally, this should be documented in a legal partnership agreement, to avoid future disputes. A joint venture is a form of general partnership that remains valid until a certain project is completed or a certain period elapses.A limited partnership differs from other partnerships in that the partners are allowed to have limited liability. This means that partners are only liable for the business’ debts up to a certain limit. This limit depends on the individual partner’s investment contribution. A limited partnership venture is run by one or two partners known as general partner(s). Other contributors, known as limited or silent partners, provide capital but aren’t allowed to make managerial decisions.Formation of Limited PartnershipAlmost all U.S. states govern the formation of limited partnerships under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which was amended in 1985. It was originally known as the Limited Partnership Act, created in 1916 and adopted by 49 states, plus the District of Columbia.To form a limited partnership, the partners must register the venture in the applicable state, typically through the office of the local Secretary of State. It is important to obtain all relevant business permits and licenses, which vary based on locality, state or industry. The U.S. Small Business Administration lists down all local, state and federal permits and licenses necessary to start a business.

Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships




The partnerships that limit personal liability for business debts.


By Peri Pakroo




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





Limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) are both businesses with more than one owner, but unlike general partnerships, limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships offer some of their owners limited personal liability for business debts.
In limited partnerships (LPs), at least one of the owners is considered a "general" partner who makes business decisions and is personally liable for business debts. But LPs also have at least one "limited" partner who invests money in the business but has minimal control over daily business decisions and operations. The advantage for these limited partners is that they are not personally liable for business debts.
The limited liability partnership (LLP) is a similar business structure but it has no general partners. All of the owners of an LLP have limited personal liability for business debts.
In order to better understand LPs and LLPs, it's helpful to compare them to general partnerships.
What is a General Partnership?
In the business world, the word "partnership" usually refers to general partnerships. A general partnership is a business that has more than one owner and that has not filed papers with the state to create a specific entity such as a corporation or limited liability company (LLC). (To learn more about general partnerships, see Nolo's Partnerships area.)
In a general partnership:

all partners (called general partners) are personally liable for all business debts, including court judgments
each individual partner can be sued for the full amount of any business debt (though that partner can in turn sue the other partners for their share of the debt), and
each partner has "agency authority" for the partnership -- that is, each partner can bind the whole business to a contract or business deal.

How Are Limited Partnerships Different?
A limited partnership has at least one general partner and at least one limited partner. The general partner has the same role as in a general partnership: controlling the company's day-to-day operations and being personally liable for business debts.
The role of limited partners, however, differs in a few ways:

Limited partners do not play an active role in the business. The limited partners (most LPs have more than one limited partner) contribute financially to the business (for example, a limited partner might invest $100,000 in a real estate partnership) but have minimal control over business decisions or operations, and normally cannot bind the partnership to business deals.
Limited partners are not personally liable. In return for giving up management power, limited partners get the benefit of protection from personal liability. This means that a limited partner can't be forced to pay off business debts or claims with personal assets. A limited partner, however, can lose his or her financial investment in the business.
Limited partners face slightly different tax rules. For income tax purposes, limited partnerships generally are treated like general partnerships, with all partners individually reporting and paying taxes on their share of the profits each year. Limited partners, as a rule, do not have to pay self-employment taxes; because they are not active in the business, their share of partnership income is not considered "earned income" for purposes of the self-employment tax.

Limited partners need to understand that they can become personally liable if they do not stick to their passive role. If a limited partner starts taking an active role in the business, that partner's liability can become unlimited. If a creditor can prove that a limited partner took acts that led the creditor to believe that he or she was a general partner, that partner can be held fully and personally liable for the creditor's claims.
 Some states have carved out exceptions to this "active role in the business" rule. These exceptions usually allow a limited partner to vote on issues that affect the basic structure of the partnership, including the removal of general partners, terminating the partnership, amending the partnership agreement, or selling all or most of the assets of the partnership, without jeopardizing limited partner status.
Limited Liability Partnerships
Another kind of partnership, called a limited liability partnership (LLP) or sometimes called a registered limited liability partnership (RLLP), provides all of its owners with limited personal liability. LLPs are particularly well-suited to professional groups, such as lawyers and accountants. In fact, in some states LLPs are only available to professionals.
Professionals often prefer LLPs to general partnerships, corporations, or LLCs because they don't want to be personally liable for another partner's problems -- particularly those involving malpractice claims. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership arising from professional malpractice lawsuits against another partner. (A partner who loses a malpractice suit for his own mistakes, however, doesn't escape liability.) Forming a corporation to protect personal assets may be too much trouble, and some states (including California) won't allow licensed professionals to form an LLC.
How to Create an LP or LLP
Creating a limited partnership or limited liability partnership is done at the state level. Each state has its own rules, but in general you must pay a fee and file papers with the state, usually a "certificate of limited partnership" or "certificate of limited liability partnership." This document is similar to the articles (or certificate) filed by a corporation or an LLC and includes information about the general and limited partners. Filing fees for LPs and LLPs are similar to those for corporations and LLCs.

FLP: What is a Family Limited Partnership and How Can It Save Your Family Money?
by Stephanie Morrow, August 2009





 Some of the hardest decisions a family can make are how to handle money, property and other family investments. An answer to these difficult questions, especially for families with considerable real estate holdings, is establishing a Family Limited Partnership (FLP). When used properly, an FLP can be very profitable and save families thousands of dollars in gift and estate taxes. FLPs provide both protection from creditors and flexibility not found in other trusts, as it can be amended or changed.  What is an FLP? An FLP is a limited partnership controlled by members of a family; like other limited partnerships, an FLP consists of two types of partners: general and limited. General partners control all management and investment decisions and bear 100% of the liability. Limited partners cannot participate in the management of the FLP and have limited liability. The partnership itself isn't taxable - instead, the owners of a partnership report the partnership's income and deductions on their personal tax return, in proportion to their interests.  In an FLP, generally, the senior family members (parents or grandparents) contribute assets in exchange for a small general partner interest and a large limited partner interest. They can then give all or a portion of the limited partner interest to their children and grandchildren. This interest can go to the heirs directly, or be set aside in a trust.  Benefits of an FLP Transferring limited partnership interests to family members reduces the taxable estate of senior family members. The senior family members transfer the value of the asset to their children, removing it from their estates for federal estate tax purposes, while retaining control over the decisions and distributions of the investment. Since the limited partners cannot control investments or distributions, they may be eligible for valuation discounts at the time of transfer.  Transfers of limited partnership interests are also eligible for the annual gift tax exclusion, a powerful tool for reducing income, gift and estate taxes. According to law, the value of limited partnership shares can be discounted when transferred to family members. In addition, because of an FLP's flexibility, the family members who are owners can usually amend the partnership agreement as family circumstances change. An FLP also protects assets from claims of future creditors and spouses of failed marriages. Creditors may not force cash distributions, vote, or own the interest of a limited partner without the consent of the general partners. And in the event of a divorce, where a limited partner ceases to be a family member, the partnership documents can require a transfer back to the family for fair market value, keeping the asset within the family structure. By combining investments together into an FLP, a family's investment fees are significantly reduced. Instead of maintaining separate brokerage accounts or trusts for each child, the partnership can hold one brokerage account, and the children or trusts for children can own partnership interests. How Do I Begin? An FLP must be structured with both the present and future owners in mind, protecting the generations of today as well as generations to come. To begin the FLP process, a written limited partnership agreement must be prepared. After the agreement is prepared, assets may be transferred, such as real estate, corporate stock, or cash. FLPs are not designed for the transfer of an individual's home, life insurance, or retirement plans. The general partnership interests are retained by the senior partners for their lifetime, while the limited partnership interests are given as gifts over time to the limited partners. Be Careful With FLPs Care should be taken both when creating the FLP and in observing the formalities of operating the FLP as a family business. Be sure to investigate state laws and the rights and obligations associated with transferred property, and always discuss any of these decisions with professional appraisers.

Partnership Basics




Learn more about the simplest business structure for companies with more than one owner.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.

A partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships -- general partnerships and limited partnerships. The general partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know about the personal liability of general partners.
By definition, a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships: general partnerships and limited partnerships. This article discusses general partnerships, the more common structure in which every partner has a hand in managing the business.
The partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know before you begin.
Personal Liability for All Owners
First, partners are personally liable for all business debts and obligations, including court judgments. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor, such as a supplier, lender, or landlord, the creditor can legally come after any partner's house, car, or other possessions.
There are a few exceptions to this personal liability. Some of the partners can have limited personal liability if the partnership is set up as a limited partnership. This is a partnership in which only the general partner, who runs the business, has personal liability, while the limited partners, who are basically passive investors, can lose no more than their stake in the partnership. Also, some states allow special limited liability partnerships (LLPs). More commonly, though, businesspeople who are particularly concerned about personal liability choose to incorporate their business or operate as a limited liability company (LLC). For more information, see Nolo's articles on corporations  and  limited liability companies.
Joint Authority
In addition, any individual partner can usually bind the whole business to a contract or other business deal. For instance, if your partner signs a year-long contract with a supplier to buy inventory at a price your business can't afford, you can be held personally responsible for the money owed under the contract.
There are just a few limits on a partner's ability to commit the partnership to a deal -- for instance, one partner can't bind the partnership to a sale of all of the partnership's assets. But generally, unless an outsider has reason to know of any limits the partners have placed on each other's authority in their partnership agreement, any partner can bind the others to a deal.
Joint Liability
Each individual partner can be sued for -- and required to pay -- the full amount of any business debt. If this happens, an individual partner's only recourse may be to sue the other partners for their shares of the debt.
Because of this combination of personal liability for all partnership debt and the authority of each partner to bind the partnership, it's critical that you trust the people with whom you start your business.
Partnership Taxes
A partnership is not a separate tax entity from its owners; instead, it's what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity." This means the partnership itself does not pay any income taxes on profits. Business income simply "passes through" the business to the partners, who report their share of profits (or losses) on their individual income tax returns. In addition, each partner must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS each year.
While the partnership itself doesn't pay taxes, it must file IRS Form 1065, an informational return, each year. This form sets out each partner's share of the partnership profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure the partners are reporting their income correctly.
For more information on reporting and paying partnership taxes, see How Partnerships Are Taxed.
Creating a Partnership
You don't have to file any paperwork to establish an ordinary partnership -- just agreeing to go into business with another person will get you started.
Of course, partnerships must  meet the same local registration requirements as any new business. Most cities and counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. You may also have to obtain an employer identification number from the IRS, a seller's license from your state, and a zoning permit from your local planning board.
In addition, your partnership may have to register a fictitious or assumed business name. If your business name doesn't contain all of the partners' last names (for instance, you want to use "London Landscapes" instead of "Harper & Reed Landscapes"), you usually must register that name -- known as a fictitious or assumed business name -- with your county clerk. For more information on fictitious business names, see Registering Your Business Name.
While the owners of a partnership are not legally required to have a written partnership agreement, it makes good sense to put the details of ownership, including the partners' rights and responsibilities and their share of profits, into a written agreement. For more about why partnership agreements are so important, read Creating a Partnership Agreement.
Ending a Partnership
One disadvantage of partnerships is that when one partner wants to leave the company, the partnership generally dissolves. In that case, the partners must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, and divide any assets and profits among themselves.
If you want to prevent this kind of ending for your business, you should create a buy-sell agreement, or buyout agreement, which can be included as part of your partnership agreement. A buy-sell/buyout agreement helps partners decide and plan for what will happen when one partner retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the partnership to pursue other interests. For example, such an agreement might allow the partners to buy out a departing partner's interest, so business can continue as usual. For more information, see Plan Ahead for Changes in Partnership Ownership.
For more information on the legal and practical issues involved in forming a business partnership, see Form a Partnership: The Complete Legal Guide, by Ralph Warner and Denis Clifford (Nolo). Or, to create a "business prenup" that will protect a business if someone leaves, seeBusiness Buyout Agreements: A Step-by-Step Guide for Co-Owners, by Bethany Laurence and Anthony Mancuso (Nolo).

What is a limited partnership (LP)?




						By: 
						
Adam Colgate





Business partnerships can be either general or limited, and as far as tax codes are concerned, exist as long as profits, losses and costs of a business are shared. While general partnerships are more common, limited partnerships are a popular method of raising capital from passive investors who prefer to not be involved in day-to-day business operations. Limited partnerships (LPs) have two sets of partners, namely one or more general partners who have personal liability and one or more limited partners who are not liable for debts. Business owners who do not want the liability for the debts incurred by the corporation prefer this option. Limited partners usually do not play any role in the day-to-day management of the company.Pros of Limited Partnerships:Generally, pass-through taxation is applicable to limited partnerships, meaning that the tax burden is passed on to the partners instead of the partnership itself. Thus, profit earnings are passed on to the partners in the form of wages, income, and profit payments and each partner pays tax that is proportionate to his individual share of profits.A business can obtain much-needed investment capital by giving more passive investors the option of reducing their risks by becoming limited partnersSince there is no direct involvement of limited partners in the management of the business, general partners enjoy full autonomy and have the right to make important business decisions.In the case of a general partnership, all partners are responsible for the debts and other liabilities. The liability of a limited partner does not exceed his capital investment in the company.In the event of a lawsuit the names of the limited partners cannot be included in the list of defendants. Limited partnerships are quite common in businesses such as restaurants and other business ventures where there is high financial risk. The limited partners will only provide the necessary funds, and stay aloof from the business operations and management. Due to this lack of involvement in management of business, LPs are also called "passive investors". In order to enter limited partnership, partners need to file the necessary formation documents with the concerned state agency along with the state filing fees applicable. Cons of Limited Partnerships: Limited partnerships do have downsides:   Certain tax rules restrict LPs from claiming partnership losses beyond $25,000 per year. If losses exceed this amount the partners can carry forward the amount of passive investment losses to be claimed in the tax returns for the following year. This limit is exercised each tax year and is applicable to all those who are only concerned with the capital aspect of business ventures and in no way interfere in the business affairs.  It is fairly easy to compute tax if partners have invested only cash. However, if non-cash financing options, such as vehicles or real estate, are involved more complicated tax rules are applicable.  Sometimes limited partners may be tempted to participate in the management of the business and may therefore want to step out of the passive investor role. This kind of involvement may make them general partners and forbid them from exercising their limited liability privilege.

 Typical Examples of a General Partnership | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  Typical Examples of a General Partnership  by Michelle Reynolds        A general partnership can form the basis of a variety of businesses. Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Sole Proprietors] | 10 Examples of Sole Proprietors 2 [Limited Liability Partnership] | Examples of Limited Liability Partnership 3 [Corporate Business Strategies] | Examples of Corporate Business Strategies 4 [Corporation Types] | S Corporation Types of Businesses    A general partnership is a legal entity binding two or more business partners in responsibility and liability for their business. There are two types of general partnerships: unlimited and limited. In an unlimited general partnership, all partners in the business are equally responsible for the debts and other liabilities incurred by the business, and they all participate in operations. In limited partnerships, individuals invest in the company and share in its profits, but are not responsible for daily business activities and do not share in the business’s liabilities. General partnerships can occur when two or more people develop a business with the intent to earn profit.        Medical General partnerships commonly occur between physicians who share office space. For example, a visit to your doctor’s office might reveal another, or several, doctors maintaining separate practices in the same building. These doctors may have combined their efforts to form a general partnership. One advantage of doing so might be that it can be easier to secure a business loan when more than one individual is applying with collateral. Surgeons may also form a general partnership when they work together to offer surgical specialties, such as through a surgical group. A disadvantage to a medical general partnership may be in cases of malpractice; all practitioners in the general partnership are equally responsible for the costs incurred through malpractice litigation. Legal General partnerships are the basis for many legal firms. An example of a general partnership among attorneys might be, “The Law Offices of Smith, Jones and Daniels.” A law office might have numerous partners within a business structure defined similarly to doctors, possessing several associated professionals with different specialties working in the same building. Attorneys may have more immediate pertinent legal knowledge enabling them to configure their partnerships in ways that will limit liability for each participant. Real Estate General partnerships can exist for businesses focusing on real estate. A real estate office may be owned by some of the people working there, each of whom may administer their own sales and generate profits for the umbrella business. For example, a real estate office employing 20 agents may be owned by a general partnership consisting of five of those agents. The remaining 15 brokers may be employees of the business, carrying on their own work and contributing a commission to the overall business income of the general partnership. Alternatively, the owners of the office may be limited partners, contributing investment funds to the business and not engaging in sales or other operational activities. Creative General partnerships can be found in creative endeavors, such as advertising, marketing and graphic design businesses. The various duties in the partnership might be delineated with one or more partners selling and developing accounts while the others create advertising and marketing strategies. An example of a limited general partnership in a creative field is a dance studio where one individual is the working partner and dance instructor, and another “silent” partner is contributing to the business through investing in the studio.
