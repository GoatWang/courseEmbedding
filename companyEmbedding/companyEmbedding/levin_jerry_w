When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics.

Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]

American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.
Philanthropy[edit]
Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

Biography and education[edit]
Levin graduated from the University of Michigan with B.S.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and received an MBA from the University of Chicago in 1968.
Pillsbury[edit]
From 1974-1989, Levin worked for the Pillsbury Company. In his initial capacity as head of corporate development, Levin completed hundreds of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Some of the transactions he led included Häagen-Dazs, Green Giant, Totino's Pizza, Steak and Ale, Chart House, and American Beauty Macaroni. Levin also became the chief executive officer of several operating units within Pillsbury, including Häagen-Dazs and the second largest restaurant group in the U.S. (comprising Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Chart House and Godfather's Pizza).
Coleman[edit]
From 1989 until 1991, Levin was the chief executive officer of The Coleman Company, Inc., or Coleman. During his tenure as their chief executive officer, he divested non-strategic businesses to devote resources to their core camping business. He returned as chief executive officer of Coleman from 1997 until the sale of Coleman to Sunbeam Corporation in 1998.
Revlon[edit]
From 1991 until 1997, Levin was the chief executive officer of Revlon, Inc. When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. By the end of his tenure as chief executive officer, the firm had been restructured with its debt load significantly reduced and the number one market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]
From June 1998 until January 2005, Levin served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Household, Inc. (formerly named Sunbeam), the holding company for Coleman, Sunbeam Products, Inc., Coleman Powermate, Inc., and First Alert, Inc. He was hired after the termination of Al Dunlap with Sunbeam facing numerous significant financial, operational and legal issues, and restructured Sunbeam’s operations during 1999 and 2000; in 2001, he led Sunbeam through a chapter 11 restructuring. American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.

Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing.

Levin also became the chief executive officer of several operating units within Pillsbury, including Häagen-Dazs and the second largest restaurant group in the U.S. (comprising Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Chart House and Godfather's Pizza).
Coleman[edit]
From 1989 until 1991, Levin was the chief executive officer of The Coleman Company, Inc., or Coleman. During his tenure as their chief executive officer, he divested non-strategic businesses to devote resources to their core camping business. He returned as chief executive officer of Coleman from 1997 until the sale of Coleman to Sunbeam Corporation in 1998.
Revlon[edit]
From 1991 until 1997, Levin was the chief executive officer of Revlon, Inc. When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. By the end of his tenure as chief executive officer, the firm had been restructured with its debt load significantly reduced and the number one market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]
From June 1998 until January 2005, Levin served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Household, Inc. (formerly named Sunbeam), the holding company for Coleman, Sunbeam Products, Inc., Coleman Powermate, Inc., and First Alert, Inc. He was hired after the termination of Al Dunlap with Sunbeam facing numerous significant financial, operational and legal issues, and restructured Sunbeam’s operations during 1999 and 2000; in 2001, he led Sunbeam through a chapter 11 restructuring. American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.
Philanthropy[edit]
Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

See You in the Music: Remembering Natalie Cole
Huffington Post - over 1 year

  At Natalie Cole's 60th birthday party in New York City. Photo by Bob Krassner, used by permission.    In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 2005, three years into our friendship, I enjoyed one of the most intimate and spontaneous performances ever given by Natalie Cole. It consisted of a single song sung barely above a whisper to an audience of one: me.     We were in Aspen, Colorado at a swanky party at the peak of Ajax Mountain. Leaving together, we stepped outside, first into a blast of cold air and a windy swirl of snow, then into a gondola that would transport us down the side of the mountain and back to earth. The cozy pod lifted us off into the sky and soon our visibility was obscured by the feathery blanket of white.     Moments later, the motor suddenly stopped. She and I hung suspended high above the ground as the wind rocked our car from side to side as though it were a child's bassinet. We suddenly occupied an imaginary world that was like a snow globe: surreal but

Tony Ortega: Scientology Spying Portrayed in TV True-Crime Docudrama Airing January 16
Huffington Post - over 4 years


        

Discovery Channel's true-crime sister network, Investigation Discovery, is airing a one-hour dramatization of Nancy Many's life as a Scientology spy next week, at 10:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 16.

 The show is based on Many's 2009 memoir, My Billion-Year Contract, in which she describes one of the most remarkable careers in Scientology -- from working directly with church founder L. Ron Hubbard, to spying for the church on its enemies, to running the Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles, and to being sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force prison detail in Florida while she was five months pregnant. 

 All of that material is covered in the one-hour dramatization of Many's life which is airing next week on ID, kicking off a new true-crime series called Dangerous Persuasions, which portrays good people manipulated into doing bad things. In Canada, the show debuts on January 18 on the History Channel, and will kick off a new series by the name of Brainwashed. Well-acted and pro

LATE_ADULTHOOD


2008

Age 64





On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and Chairman of the Board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.

But, as has been pointed out, "Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December." Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.



On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and Chairman of the Board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.

1415 through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses. 1920 On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies. 21 This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
 Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as Lead Director and Chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as Lead Director and Chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.

Age 62





Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.

In that position his compensation was $750,000. CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.
 Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported: 
 "Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary. Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance. Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."



Levin is a former Chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006.

A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.



While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was Chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim Chief Executive Officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.

On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers. 13 Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.

Wilton Brands names Jerry Levin CEO


(Crain's) -- Wilton Brands Inc. has given interim CEO Jerry W. Levin the job permanently.
Mr. Levin, who will continue as the Woodridge-based company's chairman, became CEO at the end of October when Richard Conti resigned.
Wilton Brands Inc. sells cake-decorating, bakeware, scrapbooking and Martha Stewart Crafts items.
In mid-October Wilton parent Wilton Holdings Inc. struck a restructuring deal with its largest creditors, TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P. and Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas, after they attempted to force Wilton Holdings into bankruptcy over $208 million in unpaid debt. The two creditors became majority owners of Wilton Holdings.
That involuntary bankruptcy petition did not include Wilton Brands.
In a statement, Mr. Levin said: "Since serving as chairman and interim chief executive officer, I have been impressed with Wilton, and its great products, brands and people. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that exist at Wilton. "

Manhattan Transfers
Retired Revlon Exec Sells Lenox Hill Pad for $10.5 M.

The floorplan



Oh look! There's the Frick.



Adjacent to the master bedroom: two marble baths



What kind of library would be without custom bookcases and a fireplace?

Certainly Jerry W. Levin, the former CEO of Revlon, knows how to show something to its best advantage. So it’s no surprise that he managed to get the full $10.5 million ask for his full-floor condo, and in record time, too.
The three-bedroom, 4.5-bath in a French classical limestone mansion at 11-15 East 70th Street, listed Corcoran brokers Wendy J. Sarasohn and Jamie Joseph,  certainly had its make-up professionally done for its  photos, which show a sprawling and lavishly-decorated space. And its looks quickly caught the eye of whoever is behind limited-liability company Kinderman LLC.
Besides being steps from Central Park (enough or a perk to make even the teensiest pied-a-terre look like a knock-out), the home has a living room with three sets of French doors that open onto an oversized Parisian balcony. A grand staircase leads to the dining room and library, with fireplace, Southern-facing windows and custom bookcases.


The master-bedroom wing comes with a bedroom avec fireplace and two marble bathrooms (having only one could lead to the occasional inconvenience, after all), a walk-in closet a separate sitting room and home office overlooking the Frick.
Other features include a separate wing for the two additional bedrooms (each with private bath), a dramatic entry foyer and an eat-in kitchen. We wonder if it comes stocked with Hagaan-Dazs, one of the brands that Mr. Levin oversaw during an earlier stint as a Pillsbury exec?
(May we note, it may be a nice housewarming present for the delightful LLC that’s soon to move in).


Mr. Levin and wife Carol purchased the home some years ago, during Mr. Levin’s climb to the top of the corporate ladder. But not to worry, we’re sure he’ll be able to afford a nice new place, as he’s currently chair and CEO of Wilton brands, and services on the Board of Directors for Saks and U.S. Bancorp.

Biography and education[edit]
Levin graduated from the University of Michigan with B.S.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and received an MBA from the University of Chicago in 1968.
Pillsbury[edit]
From 1974-1989, Levin worked for the Pillsbury Company. In his initial capacity as head of corporate development, Levin completed hundreds of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Some of the transactions he led included Häagen-Dazs, Green Giant, Totino's Pizza, Steak and Ale, Chart House, and American Beauty Macaroni. Levin also became the chief executive officer of several operating units within Pillsbury, including Häagen-Dazs and the second largest restaurant group in the U.S. (comprising Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Chart House and Godfather's Pizza).
Coleman[edit]
From 1989 until 1991, Levin was the chief executive officer of The Coleman Company, Inc., or Coleman. During his tenure as their chief executive officer, he divested non-strategic businesses to devote resources to their core camping business. He returned as chief executive officer of Coleman from 1997 until the sale of Coleman to Sunbeam Corporation in 1998.
Revlon[edit]
From 1991 until 1997, Levin was the chief executive officer of Revlon, Inc. When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. By the end of his tenure as chief executive officer, the firm had been restructured with its debt load significantly reduced and the number one market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]
From June 1998 until January 2005, Levin served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Household, Inc. (formerly named Sunbeam), the holding company for Coleman, Sunbeam Products, Inc., Coleman Powermate, Inc., and First Alert, Inc. He was hired after the termination of Al Dunlap with Sunbeam facing numerous significant financial, operational and legal issues, and restructured Sunbeam’s operations during 1999 and 2000; in 2001, he led Sunbeam through a chapter 11 restructuring. American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.
Philanthropy[edit]
Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

Biography and education[edit]
Levin graduated from the University of Michigan with B.S.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and received an MBA from the University of Chicago in 1968.
Pillsbury[edit]
From 1974-1989, Levin worked for the Pillsbury Company. In his initial capacity as head of corporate development, Levin completed hundreds of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Some of the transactions he led included Häagen-Dazs, Green Giant, Totino's Pizza, Steak and Ale, Chart House, and American Beauty Macaroni. Levin also became the chief executive officer of several operating units within Pillsbury, including Häagen-Dazs and the second largest restaurant group in the U.S. (comprising Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Chart House and Godfather's Pizza).
Coleman[edit]
From 1989 until 1991, Levin was the chief executive officer of The Coleman Company, Inc., or Coleman. During his tenure as their chief executive officer, he divested non-strategic businesses to devote resources to their core camping business. He returned as chief executive officer of Coleman from 1997 until the sale of Coleman to Sunbeam Corporation in 1998.
Revlon[edit]
From 1991 until 1997, Levin was the chief executive officer of Revlon, Inc. When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. By the end of his tenure as chief executive officer, the firm had been restructured with its debt load significantly reduced and the number one market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]
From June 1998 until January 2005, Levin served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Household, Inc. (formerly named Sunbeam), the holding company for Coleman, Sunbeam Products, Inc., Coleman Powermate, Inc., and First Alert, Inc. He was hired after the termination of Al Dunlap with Sunbeam facing numerous significant financial, operational and legal issues, and restructured Sunbeam’s operations during 1999 and 2000; in 2001, he led Sunbeam through a chapter 11 restructuring. American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.
Philanthropy[edit]
Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

During his tenure as their chief executive officer, he divested non-strategic businesses to devote resources to their core camping business. He returned as chief executive officer of Coleman from 1997 until the sale of Coleman to Sunbeam Corporation in 1998.
Revlon[edit]
From 1991 until 1997, Levin was the chief executive officer of Revlon, Inc. When he joined Revlon, it was suffering from significant losses and debt load, and had a number three, and declining, market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. By the end of his tenure as chief executive officer, the firm had been restructured with its debt load significantly reduced and the number one market share in the United States mass market for color cosmetics. Levin oversaw the divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and the development and launch of several new products and brands, including Colorstay.
American Household[edit]
From June 1998 until January 2005, Levin served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Household, Inc. (formerly named Sunbeam), the holding company for Coleman, Sunbeam Products, Inc., Coleman Powermate, Inc., and First Alert, Inc. He was hired after the termination of Al Dunlap with Sunbeam facing numerous significant financial, operational and legal issues, and restructured Sunbeam’s operations during 1999 and 2000; in 2001, he led Sunbeam through a chapter 11 restructuring. American Household, Inc., was sold in two separate transactions during 2004 and at the time of its sale, its businesses were the leading or one of the leading businesses in the markets they served.
JW Levin Partners & Sharper Image[edit]
While at JW Levin Partners, a private management and investment firm, Levin was chairman of Sharper Image Corporation from September 2006 to April 2008 and interim chief executive officer of the firm from September 2006 through April 2007.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as a result low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[13] Some analysts concluded Levin was responsible, having ignored any advice or wisdom from Thalheimer, and previous management.
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board to join other investors in acquiring some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[14][15] through JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[19][20] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[21] This made Levin seem to be more bluster than substance.
Board directorships[edit]
Current Positions - Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Governance Committee; U.S. Bancorp where Levin serves as lead director and chairman of the Compensation Committee; JW Levin Partners LLC; Saks Incorporated (NYSE:SKS) where he serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee; Wilton Brands, Inc; he also serves on the board of The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration.
Philanthropy[edit]
Levin has served as the chair of the board of the UJA-Federation of New York since 2007. UJA is the world’s largest local philanthropy, serving over 4.5 million individuals in New York, in Israel, and around the world each year through more than 100-health, human-service, educational and community service agencies.
First engaged in UJA-Federation activities in 1991, Levin moved through a variety of capacities to chair of the Board, As chair of the board, Levin is the leader of UJA-Federation’s Annual Campaign. At the opening event of 2008, held in late September, although financial crises had occurred in many Wall Street financial institutions, $43 million was raised, exceeding last years’ efforts by $2 million.
Sharper Image[edit]
Levin is a former chairman of Sharper Image Corporation, a specialty retailer, a post he stepped into in September 2006. A few months later, he helped oust founder Richard Thalheimer as CEO, who later also resigned as chairman.[1] Levin then served as interim CEO of Sharper Image from September 2006 until April 2007.[2] In that position his compensation was $750,000.[3] CNET News reported that for years, Sharper Image's "management failed miserably at trying to turn the company around," not just during Levin's tenure.[4]
Motley Fool published an article on March 17, 2007, with a section entitled "Sharper Image's dull deal," in which it scrutinized and criticized the Sharper Image's compensation arrangement with Levin, despite the fact that compensation and employment also covered other personnel from JW Levin Partners LLC, not just Levin. The article reported:

"Worse still is the sweet deal Sharper Image ... gave to interim CEO Jerry Levin. After reporting a 24% decline in same-store sales for February, the ailing retailer effectively doubled his salary.... Let's do the math. Unless Sharper Image hires another CEO before the end of June, Levin will be due $700,000, plus $83,333 for 25 days of service in September. And that's on top of stock options and the $750,000 in cash that he's due per his first contract. But my problem isn't so much with Levin's level of compensation as with his terms. Remember, every dollar of Levin's raise is paid in advance.... Those are extremely generous and unsettling terms."[5]

Less than a year later, on February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It blamed low sales, aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers, dating years back to Thalheimer's leadership time.[6]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and chairman of the board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets.[7][8] But, as has been pointed out,

"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[1]

Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years prior to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.[9][10]
On February 8, 2008, directly before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing. The filing showed $200 million proceeds targeted. The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann. They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intended to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses.[11][12] On December 22, 2008, however, JWL Partners Acquisition withdrew its IPO due to poor market conditions, and the faltering U.S. and Global economies.[13]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
