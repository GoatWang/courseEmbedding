Hillcrest Labs is a sensor processing technology pioneer that develops freespace motion-control technology and the first motion-controlled remote for television.[1] Hillcrest also invented the first graphical zoomable interface for television[2] and Kylo, the first Web browser optimized for television.[3][4] The company is a subsidiary of InterDigital based in Rockville, Maryland.

History[edit]
Founded in 2001 as Hillcrest Communications, the company changed its name to Hillcrest Laboratories in 2005.[4] Founder Dan Simpkins, who had previously founded SALIX technologies, recognized that television content was becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, and he wanted to make it easier. Hillcrest developed Freespace motion sensing technology, which translates a user’s gestures into screen motion. This allows a remote control to operate as a mouse for the television.[1] The company also developed a graphical, zoomable interface for television content. Early investors included Grotech Ventures,[1] New Enterprise Associates and Columbia Capital.[5]
Timeline[edit]
In 2006, Hillcrest introduced its first products: the Loop pointer and the HoME television navigation system, with a graphical, zoomable interface.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest’s technology for the MX Air, a mouse that could be used in the air.[10]
In 2008, Hillcrest licensed its technology to Kodak, for the Kodak Theatre HD Player and Pointer Remote.[11][12] Also in 2008, Universal Electronics and Texas Instruments licensed Freespace for use in remote controls.[13][14]
In 2009, Hillcrest released the Loop pointer for sale directly to consumers.[15][16][17] PC World Magazine named The Loop pointer one of the “top 100 products of the year”[18] and one of the “greatest tech designs ever.”[19] Also in 2009, Nintendo and Hillcrest settled a patent infringement lawsuit that Hillcrest had brought. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[20][3]
In 2010, Hillcrest released the Kylo browser, a free Web browser for Windows and Mac OS X, optimized for viewing on a TV screen.[21] Hulu blocked users of Kylo from accessing the site. Hillcrest released a new version that worked with Hulu, and Hulu blocked it again.[22] Also in 2010, LG came out with the Magic Motion remote, which used Hillcrest’s technology to allow users to change channels with gestures.[23]
In 2011, Hillcrest raised new funding from NEA, AllianceBernstein, Columbia Capital, and Grotech Ventures.[24]

Technology and current products[edit]
Freespace Motion Control Technology
Freespace Motion Control Technology combines intelligent motion algorithms with MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate natural motions into cursor movement. The software compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement, consistently generating intended cursor movement.[27][28][29]
The Freespace MotionEngine software is embedded in the Roku 2 "game remote", released in 2011, which uses Freespace to control Roku’s streaming players.[30]Freespace is also used by LG for its Smart TVs and Magic Motion Remote.[23] The Logitech MX Air Mouse uses Freespace, and Popular Mechanics called this mouse the “best pointer we’ve tried.”[10] Another Freespace-enabled product is the Universal Electronics remote control.[13]
Freespace allows users to control images on a screen by using natural motions, allowing for a new way of interacting with television content. It is currently used in several products, such as the Magic Motion motion-sensing remote controls that come with some of LG Electronics’ televisions.[1][20][23][3] Other licensees of Freespace include Logitech, Sony’s videogame division,[20][3]Roku,[31] [30] Universal Electronics[20][13] and Zillion TV[32][33]
The Loop pointer
The Loop pointer, enabled by Hillcrest’s Freespace technology, is like a mouse for television. Replacing the traditional 50-button remote control, the Loop senses the viewer’s wrist movements and translates the gestures into onscreen movement. It has four buttons and a scroll wheel.[23] The Loop uses radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so it doesn’t need to be pointed at the PC, or even have a direct line of sight.[34][35][36]
The Scoop pointer
The Scoop pointer is a Freespace enabled in-air mouse that is lighter and newer than the Loop. It has nine buttons and a scroll wheel.[28]
Kylo Web browser
Kylo is a free Web browser that is optimized for the TV screen with a 10-foot user interface. It has large fonts and buttons, and an onscreen keyboard. The Kylo browser was released in March 2010, and is available for Windows and Mac OS X.[3][21][22]

History[edit]
Founded in 2001 as Hillcrest Communications, the company changed its name to Hillcrest Laboratories in 2005.[4] Founder Dan Simpkins, who had previously founded SALIX technologies, recognized that television content was becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, and he wanted to make it easier. Hillcrest developed Freespace motion sensing technology, which translates a user’s gestures into screen motion. This allows a remote control to operate as a mouse for the television.[1] The company also developed a graphical, zoomable interface for television content. Early investors included Grotech Ventures,[1] New Enterprise Associates and Columbia Capital.[5]
Timeline[edit]
In 2006, Hillcrest introduced its first products: the Loop pointer and the HoME television navigation system, with a graphical, zoomable interface.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest’s technology for the MX Air, a mouse that could be used in the air.[10]
In 2008, Hillcrest licensed its technology to Kodak, for the Kodak Theatre HD Player and Pointer Remote.[11][12] Also in 2008, Universal Electronics and Texas Instruments licensed Freespace for use in remote controls.[13][14]
In 2009, Hillcrest released the Loop pointer for sale directly to consumers.[15][16][17] PC World Magazine named The Loop pointer one of the “top 100 products of the year”[18] and one of the “greatest tech designs ever.”[19] Also in 2009, Nintendo and Hillcrest settled a patent infringement lawsuit that Hillcrest had brought. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[20][3]
In 2010, Hillcrest released the Kylo browser, a free Web browser for Windows and Mac OS X, optimized for viewing on a TV screen.[21] Hulu blocked users of Kylo from accessing the site. Hillcrest released a new version that worked with Hulu, and Hulu blocked it again.[22] Also in 2010, LG came out with the Magic Motion remote, which used Hillcrest’s technology to allow users to change channels with gestures.[23]
In 2011, Hillcrest raised new funding from NEA, AllianceBernstein, Columbia Capital, and Grotech Ventures.[24]
On December 20, 2016, InterDigital announced the acquisition of Hillcrest Labs.[25][26]

Hillcrest Labs is a sensor processing technology pioneer that develops freespace motion-control technology and the first motion-controlled remote for television.[1] Hillcrest also invented the first graphical zoomable interface for television[2] and Kylo, the first Web browser optimized for television.[3][4] The company is a subsidiary of InterDigital based in Rockville, Maryland.

History[edit]
Founded in 2001 as Hillcrest Communications, the company changed its name to Hillcrest Laboratories in 2005.[4] Founder Dan Simpkins, who had previously founded SALIX technologies, recognized that television content was becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, and he wanted to make it easier. Hillcrest developed Freespace motion sensing technology, which translates a user’s gestures into screen motion. This allows a remote control to operate as a mouse for the television.[1] The company also developed a graphical, zoomable interface for television content. Early investors included Grotech Ventures,[1] New Enterprise Associates and Columbia Capital.[5]
Timeline[edit]
In 2006, Hillcrest introduced its first products: the Loop pointer and the HoME television navigation system, with a graphical, zoomable interface.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest’s technology for the MX Air, a mouse that could be used in the air.[10]
In 2008, Hillcrest licensed its technology to Kodak, for the Kodak Theatre HD Player and Pointer Remote.[11][12] Also in 2008, Universal Electronics and Texas Instruments licensed Freespace for use in remote controls.[13][14]
In 2009, Hillcrest released the Loop pointer for sale directly to consumers.[15][16][17] PC World Magazine named The Loop pointer one of the “top 100 products of the year”[18] and one of the “greatest tech designs ever.”[19] Also in 2009, Nintendo and Hillcrest settled a patent infringement lawsuit that Hillcrest had brought. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[20][3]
In 2010, Hillcrest released the Kylo browser, a free Web browser for Windows and Mac OS X, optimized for viewing on a TV screen.[21] Hulu blocked users of Kylo from accessing the site. Hillcrest released a new version that worked with Hulu, and Hulu blocked it again.[22] Also in 2010, LG came out with the Magic Motion remote, which used Hillcrest’s technology to allow users to change channels with gestures.[23]
In 2011, Hillcrest raised new funding from NEA, AllianceBernstein, Columbia Capital, and Grotech Ventures.[24]
On December 20, 2016, InterDigital announced the acquisition of Hillcrest Labs.[25][26]
Technology and current products[edit]
Freespace Motion Control Technology
Freespace Motion Control Technology combines intelligent motion algorithms with MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate natural motions into cursor movement. The software compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement, consistently generating intended cursor movement.[27][28][29]
The Freespace MotionEngine software is embedded in the Roku 2 "game remote", released in 2011, which uses Freespace to control Roku’s streaming players.[30]Freespace is also used by LG for its Smart TVs and Magic Motion Remote.[23] The Logitech MX Air Mouse uses Freespace, and Popular Mechanics called this mouse the “best pointer we’ve tried.”[10] Another Freespace-enabled product is the Universal Electronics remote control.[13]
Freespace allows users to control images on a screen by using natural motions, allowing for a new way of interacting with television content. It is currently used in several products, such as the Magic Motion motion-sensing remote controls that come with some of LG Electronics’ televisions.[1][20][23][3] Other licensees of Freespace include Logitech, Sony’s videogame division,[20][3]Roku,[31] [30] Universal Electronics[20][13] and Zillion TV[32][33]
The Loop pointer
The Loop pointer, enabled by Hillcrest’s Freespace technology, is like a mouse for television. Replacing the traditional 50-button remote control, the Loop senses the viewer’s wrist movements and translates the gestures into onscreen movement. It has four buttons and a scroll wheel.[23] The Loop uses radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so it doesn’t need to be pointed at the PC, or even have a direct line of sight.[34][35][36]
The Scoop pointer
The Scoop pointer is a Freespace enabled in-air mouse that is lighter and newer than the Loop. It has nine buttons and a scroll wheel.[28]
Kylo Web browser
Kylo is a free Web browser that is optimized for the TV screen with a 10-foot user interface. It has large fonts and buttons, and an onscreen keyboard. The Kylo browser was released in March 2010, and is available for Windows and Mac OS X.[3][21][22]
