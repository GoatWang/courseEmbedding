From October 1998 to August 2000, she was Vice President of Business Development for Kaifa Technology and was instrumental in its acquisition by E-Tek Dynamics and later by JDS Uniphase. Through these acquisitions, she held the role of Deputy General Manager of the Kaifa Technology business unit. From May 1982 until it was acquired in September 1996, Ms. Hakimoglu held various positions including Vice President of Wireless Engineering and Vice President of the Wireless Business Unit for Aydin Corp., a telecommunications equipment company that formerly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Ms. Hakimoglu earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics from California State College, Sonoma, and a Master's Degree in Physics from Drexel University. In light of Ms. Hakimoglu's rich experience in the high-tech industry and her unique and extensive understanding of ClearOne's business, our Board has concluded that Ms. Hakimoglu should continue to serve as a director.
