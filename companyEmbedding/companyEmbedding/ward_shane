Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984)[1] is an English singer and actor of Irish Traveller Heritage, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, "That's My Goal", was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was that year's Christmas number one.[2] It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and Will Young's "Evergreen", which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3]
Ward was the first X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single. His prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4× Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: "No Promises" and "Stand by Me". The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits "If That's OK with You" and "No U Hang Up", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5× Platinum.
In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, it underperformed with first-week sales of under 23,000, and missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, Ward was dropped by Syco. In 2015, he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.[4]

In early 2005, Ward auditioned for the second series of The X Factor. He impressed all three judges (Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh) and passed through to the next round. His category (16- to 24-year olds) was then mentored by Walsh, and Ward was chosen to be among Walsh's top four contestants and perform on the live shows. Ward quickly became the bookmakers' favourite to win the show, and after making it to the grand final, he defeated Simon Cowell's duo Journey South and Sharon Osbourne's over-25 singer Andy Abraham and was crowned as the winner of The X Factor 2005.[6] He had not fallen into the bottom two throughout the entire competition, and won by a margin of 1.2% of the vote, out of a reported 10.8 million phone votes cast by viewers.

2006–07: Breakthrough and Shayne Ward[edit]
Main article: Shayne Ward (album)
Immediately after his victory on The X Factor, Ward signed a recording contract with Syco Music and his first single, "That's My Goal", was released in the UK on Wednesday, 21 December 2005. After selling 742,000 copies in the first week, including 313,000 on its first day, it became the Christmas number one single of 2005, held the top spot for four weeks and stayed in the top 75 until June 2006, a 21-week run. It became, at that time the fourth fastest-selling UK single of all time, beaten only by Elton John's "Candle in the Wind", Will Young's "Anything Is Possible/Evergreen", and Gareth Gates' "Unchained Melody" which sold 685,000, 403,000 and 335,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3] To date, "That's My Goal" has sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK. Ward also won an Ivor Nevello Award for being the Best Selling Single. Ward's second single, "No Promises", a cover of a Bryan Rice song was released on 10 April 2006, and peaked at number two (behind "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley) in the UK Singles Chart. Shayne Ward, his self-titled debut album was released on 17 April 2006. It sold 201,266 copies in the first week and entered the albums chart at number one. To date, the album has sold 520,000 copies in the UK and a further 2,000,000 worldwide, reaching number one in eight other countries. The album was certified platinum. Ward's third single was "Stand by Me". It was confirmed in Gary Barlow's autobiography My Take, that in 2006, fellow Take That member, Jason Orange threatened to quit the band, and Ward was seriously considered as his replacement. Orange, however, later changed his mind and a replacement was not required.[7] In August 2006, it was reported that Ward had developed vocal cord nodules – the same condition that stopped the singing career of Julie Andrews – and was to be flown out to Los Angeles in early September to see a specialist surgeon. His manager, Louis Walsh, released a statement that he was confident Ward would be fine and would be back at work by the end of the month. Ward had successful treatment and was indeed able to return to his singing career. In November 2006, he released his autobiography entitled My Story. He travelled to several places around the UK for book signings, which hundreds of people attended. In early 2007, Ward embarked on a solo tour of UK & Republic of Ireland venues, taking in eighteen concerts in twenty-eight days from late January to mid-February. The tour commenced in Dublin on 21 January and ended in Birmingham on 17 February 2007.
2007–08: Breathless[edit]
Main article: Breathless (Shayne Ward album)
After the completion of his successful debut tour, Ward's fourth single and first from his second album, "If That's OK with You" was given a release date of 20 August 2007, but was then delayed and became a double A-side single with "No U Hang Up". It was finally released on 24 September 2007, and charted at number two in the UK being held off by the Sugababes with "About You Now". "No U Hang Up" and "If That's OK with You" charted separately in Ireland, the former reaching number eleven and the latter entering at number one. Ward's second album, Breathless, was released on 26 November 2007, and after selling over 95,000 copies in its first week, debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, held off the top spot by his X Factor successor, Leona Lewis's, multi-platinum selling debut, Spirit. In Ireland, the album debuted at number one, removing Lewis's album from the top spot, a position it held for three weeks, and was later certified five times platinum. The second single from Ward's album was announced as "Breathless", and was released on 19 November 2007. It peaked at number six in the UK and number two in Ireland. On 10 November, Ward performed "Breathless" on the live results show of the fourth series of The X Factor, although the single was not available for download until 18 November, followed by a performance on The Paul O'Grady Show on 19 November. In the UK the album has been certified platinum with sales of over 450,000. In May 2008 Ward embarked on his month-long UK tour named The Breathless Tour 2008. He made his stage debut at London's O2 Arena and visited his home town Manchester at the MEN Arena. He also performed his complete show as a support act for Westlife's 2008 tour in front of a crowd of over 80,000 at Ireland's Croke Park. Ward also played on the opening night at The O2, Dublin, at the Cheerios Childline concert on 16 December 2008.
2008–11: Obsession[edit]
Main article: Obsession (Shayne Ward album)
Ward began working on his third album in 2009 with producers RedOne and Taio Cruz.[8] The album, titled Obsession, was released on 15 November 2010.[9] The singer worked with songwriters such as Savan Kotecha, Quiz & Larossi and Lucas Secon, while the songs produced by RedOne and Taio Cruz will not be included.[10] The first single from the album is a cover version of Nickelback's 2008 single, "Gotta Be Somebody".[11] Ward's version was released on 7 November 2010 and reached number 12 in the UK and number 10 in Ireland.[9] The video for the song premiered on 29 October 2010 and he performed the song on The X Factor on 7 November. Shayne also performed at the Miss World Pageant, which was held in Sanya, China. He did his first television appearance in over two years, on Live from Studio Five the day after his X Factor appearance, where he also performed his single. The album reached number 11 in Ireland on 19 November and peaked at number 15 in the UK on 21 November. On 8 March 2011, Shayne performed the title track from the album Obsession on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. In an interview with Digital Spy Ward stated that he hoped he could release a second single from the album.

He made his on-screen debut in August 2015.[citation needed] For his performance, he received 2016 National Television Award[17] and 2016 Inside Soap Award, both for the Best Newcomer.

2006–07: Breakthrough and Shayne Ward[edit]
Main article: Shayne Ward (album)
Immediately after his victory on The X Factor, Ward signed a recording contract with Syco Music and his first single, "That's My Goal", was released in the UK on Wednesday, 21 December 2005. After selling 742,000 copies in the first week, including 313,000 on its first day, it became the Christmas number one single of 2005, held the top spot for four weeks and stayed in the top 75 until June 2006, a 21-week run. It became, at that time the fourth fastest-selling UK single of all time, beaten only by Elton John's "Candle in the Wind", Will Young's "Anything Is Possible/Evergreen", and Gareth Gates' "Unchained Melody" which sold 685,000, 403,000 and 335,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3] To date, "That's My Goal" has sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK. Ward also won an Ivor Nevello Award for being the Best Selling Single. Ward's second single, "No Promises", a cover of a Bryan Rice song was released on 10 April 2006, and peaked at number two (behind "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley) in the UK Singles Chart. Shayne Ward, his self-titled debut album was released on 17 April 2006. It sold 201,266 copies in the first week and entered the albums chart at number one. To date, the album has sold 520,000 copies in the UK and a further 2,000,000 worldwide, reaching number one in eight other countries. The album was certified platinum. Ward's third single was "Stand by Me". It was confirmed in Gary Barlow's autobiography My Take, that in 2006, fellow Take That member, Jason Orange threatened to quit the band, and Ward was seriously considered as his replacement. Orange, however, later changed his mind and a replacement was not required.[7] In August 2006, it was reported that Ward had developed vocal cord nodules – the same condition that stopped the singing career of Julie Andrews – and was to be flown out to Los Angeles in early September to see a specialist surgeon. His manager, Louis Walsh, released a statement that he was confident Ward would be fine and would be back at work by the end of the month. Ward had successful treatment and was indeed able to return to his singing career. In November 2006, he released his autobiography entitled My Story. He travelled to several places around the UK for book signings, which hundreds of people attended. In early 2007, Ward embarked on a solo tour of UK & Republic of Ireland venues, taking in eighteen concerts in twenty-eight days from late January to mid-February. The tour commenced in Dublin on 21 January and ended in Birmingham on 17 February 2007.
2007–08: Breathless[edit]
Main article: Breathless (Shayne Ward album)
After the completion of his successful debut tour, Ward's fourth single and first from his second album, "If That's OK with You" was given a release date of 20 August 2007, but was then delayed and became a double A-side single with "No U Hang Up". It was finally released on 24 September 2007, and charted at number two in the UK being held off by the Sugababes with "About You Now". "No U Hang Up" and "If That's OK with You" charted separately in Ireland, the former reaching number eleven and the latter entering at number one. Ward's second album, Breathless, was released on 26 November 2007, and after selling over 95,000 copies in its first week, debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, held off the top spot by his X Factor successor, Leona Lewis's, multi-platinum selling debut, Spirit. In Ireland, the album debuted at number one, removing Lewis's album from the top spot, a position it held for three weeks, and was later certified five times platinum. The second single from Ward's album was announced as "Breathless", and was released on 19 November 2007. It peaked at number six in the UK and number two in Ireland. On 10 November, Ward performed "Breathless" on the live results show of the fourth series of The X Factor, although the single was not available for download until 18 November, followed by a performance on The Paul O'Grady Show on 19 November. In the UK the album has been certified platinum with sales of over 450,000. In May 2008 Ward embarked on his month-long UK tour named The Breathless Tour 2008. He made his stage debut at London's O2 Arena and visited his home town Manchester at the MEN Arena. He also performed his complete show as a support act for Westlife's 2008 tour in front of a crowd of over 80,000 at Ireland's Croke Park. Ward also played on the opening night at The O2, Dublin, at the Cheerios Childline concert on 16 December 2008.
2008–11: Obsession[edit]
Main article: Obsession (Shayne Ward album)
Ward began working on his third album in 2009 with producers RedOne and Taio Cruz.[8] The album, titled Obsession, was released on 15 November 2010.[9] The singer worked with songwriters such as Savan Kotecha, Quiz & Larossi and Lucas Secon, while the songs produced by RedOne and Taio Cruz will not be included.[10] The first single from the album is a cover version of Nickelback's 2008 single, "Gotta Be Somebody".[11] Ward's version was released on 7 November 2010 and reached number 12 in the UK and number 10 in Ireland.[9] The video for the song premiered on 29 October 2010 and he performed the song on The X Factor on 7 November. Shayne also performed at the Miss World Pageant, which was held in Sanya, China. He did his first television appearance in over two years, on Live from Studio Five the day after his X Factor appearance, where he also performed his single. The album reached number 11 in Ireland on 19 November and peaked at number 15 in the UK on 21 November. On 8 March 2011, Shayne performed the title track from the album Obsession on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. In an interview with Digital Spy Ward stated that he hoped he could release a second single from the album.

On 9 June 2011, it was announced that Ward would star as Stacee Jaxx in 1980s-themed musical Rock of Ages at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London.[12] For this role, Ward received a nomination for The DEWYNTERS London Newcomer of the Year award from the 2012 What's on Stage Awards.[13] He has since announced that he will be returning to the studio in September 2012, after his contract with Rock of Ages ends.[citation needed] In February 2014, Ward released a version of "Falling Slowly" with Louise Dearman. In 2014, Ward joined the cast of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds for the final arena tour of that production, as the Artilleryman.[14]

Main article: Closer (Shayne Ward album)
On 19 September 2014, Ward announced that he has been working on a new album with Mike Stock, with a then-projected release of February 2015 through PledgeMusic.[15] Ward later postponed the release to April, with the video for the first single "My Heart Would Take You Back", due to be filmed on 25 February 2015 in London.[16] On 12 May 2015, ITV announced they had signed Ward to a one-year contract deal to appear on Coronation Street as Aidan Connor, a "distant cousin of Michelle who grew up on the same estate as her and knicker boss Carla Connor". He made his on-screen debut in August 2015.[citation needed] For his performance, he received 2016 National Television Award[17] and 2016 Inside Soap Award, both for the Best Newcomer.

Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984)[1] is an English singer and actor of Irish Traveller Heritage, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, "That's My Goal", was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was that year's Christmas number one.[2] It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and Will Young's "Evergreen", which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3]
Ward was the first X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single. His prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4× Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: "No Promises" and "Stand by Me". The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits "If That's OK with You" and "No U Hang Up", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5× Platinum.
In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, it underperformed with first-week sales of under 23,000, and missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, Ward was dropped by Syco. In 2015, he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.[4]

Early life[edit]
Ward was born in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England to Irish Traveller parents who settled in England. in 2002 he reached the final thirty of Popstars: The Rivals.[5] Prior to his participation in The X Factor, Ward was in a band called Destiny with two women named Tracy Murphy and Tracey Lyle, performing at pubs, clubs and weddings.[5]

Main article: The X Factor (UK series 2)
In early 2005, Ward auditioned for the second series of The X Factor. He impressed all three judges (Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh) and passed through to the next round. His category (16- to 24-year olds) was then mentored by Walsh, and Ward was chosen to be among Walsh's top four contestants and perform on the live shows. Ward quickly became the bookmakers' favourite to win the show, and after making it to the grand final, he defeated Simon Cowell's duo Journey South and Sharon Osbourne's over-25 singer Andy Abraham and was crowned as the winner of The X Factor 2005.[6] He had not fallen into the bottom two throughout the entire competition, and won by a margin of 1.2% of the vote, out of a reported 10.8 million phone votes cast by viewers. Immediately after the competition, his X Factor mentor Louis Walsh became his manager under a joint venture with Global Publishing and Walsh Global Management.

After selling 742,000 copies in the first week, including 313,000 on its first day, it became the Christmas number one single of 2005, held the top spot for four weeks and stayed in the top 75 until June 2006, a 21-week run. It became, at that time the fourth fastest-selling UK single of all time, beaten only by Elton John's "Candle in the Wind", Will Young's "Anything Is Possible/Evergreen", and Gareth Gates' "Unchained Melody" which sold 685,000, 403,000 and 335,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3] To date, "That's My Goal" has sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK. Ward also won an Ivor Nevello Award for being the Best Selling Single. Ward's second single, "No Promises", a cover of a Bryan Rice song was released on 10 April 2006, and peaked at number two (behind "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley) in the UK Singles Chart. Shayne Ward, his self-titled debut album was released on 17 April 2006. It sold 201,266 copies in the first week and entered the albums chart at number one. To date, the album has sold 520,000 copies in the UK and a further 2,000,000 worldwide, reaching number one in eight other countries. The album was certified platinum. Ward's third single was "Stand by Me". It was confirmed in Gary Barlow's autobiography My Take, that in 2006, fellow Take That member, Jason Orange threatened to quit the band, and Ward was seriously considered as his replacement. Orange, however, later changed his mind and a replacement was not required.[7] In August 2006, it was reported that Ward had developed vocal cord nodules – the same condition that stopped the singing career of Julie Andrews – and was to be flown out to Los Angeles in early September to see a specialist surgeon. His manager, Louis Walsh, released a statement that he was confident Ward would be fine and would be back at work by the end of the month. Ward had successful treatment and was indeed able to return to his singing career. In November 2006, he released his autobiography entitled My Story. He travelled to several places around the UK for book signings, which hundreds of people attended. In early 2007, Ward embarked on a solo tour of UK & Republic of Ireland venues, taking in eighteen concerts in twenty-eight days from late January to mid-February. The tour commenced in Dublin on 21 January and ended in Birmingham on 17 February 2007.

Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984)[1] is an English singer and actor of Irish Traveller Heritage, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, "That's My Goal", was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was that year's Christmas number one.[2] It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and Will Young's "Evergreen", which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3]
Ward was the first X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single. His prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4× Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: "No Promises" and "Stand by Me". The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits "If That's OK with You" and "No U Hang Up", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5× Platinum.
In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, it underperformed with first-week sales of under 23,000, and missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, Ward was dropped by Syco. In 2015, he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.[4]

In early 2005, Ward auditioned for the second series of The X Factor. He impressed all three judges (Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh) and passed through to the next round. His category (16- to 24-year olds) was then mentored by Walsh, and Ward was chosen to be among Walsh's top four contestants and perform on the live shows. Ward quickly became the bookmakers' favourite to win the show, and after making it to the grand final, he defeated Simon Cowell's duo Journey South and Sharon Osbourne's over-25 singer Andy Abraham and was crowned as the winner of The X Factor 2005.[6] He had not fallen into the bottom two throughout the entire competition, and won by a margin of 1.2% of the vote, out of a reported 10.8 million phone votes cast by viewers. Immediately after the competition, his X Factor mentor Louis Walsh became his manager under a joint venture with Global Publishing and Walsh Global Management.

Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984)[1] is an English singer and actor of Irish Traveller Heritage, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, "That's My Goal", was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was that year's Christmas number one.[2] It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and Will Young's "Evergreen", which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3]
Ward was the first X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single. His prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4× Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: "No Promises" and "Stand by Me". The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits "If That's OK with You" and "No U Hang Up", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5× Platinum.
In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, it underperformed with first-week sales of under 23,000, and missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, Ward was dropped by Syco. In 2015, he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.[4]

Early life[edit]
Ward was born in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England to Irish Traveller parents who settled in England. in 2002 he reached the final thirty of Popstars: The Rivals.[5] Prior to his participation in The X Factor, Ward was in a band called Destiny with two women named Tracy Murphy and Tracey Lyle, performing at pubs, clubs and weddings.[5]
Career[edit]
2005: The X Factor[edit]
Main article: The X Factor (UK series 2)
In early 2005, Ward auditioned for the second series of The X Factor. He impressed all three judges (Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh) and passed through to the next round. His category (16- to 24-year olds) was then mentored by Walsh, and Ward was chosen to be among Walsh's top four contestants and perform on the live shows. Ward quickly became the bookmakers' favourite to win the show, and after making it to the grand final, he defeated Simon Cowell's duo Journey South and Sharon Osbourne's over-25 singer Andy Abraham and was crowned as the winner of The X Factor 2005.[6] He had not fallen into the bottom two throughout the entire competition, and won by a margin of 1.2% of the vote, out of a reported 10.8 million phone votes cast by viewers. Immediately after the competition, his X Factor mentor Louis Walsh became his manager under a joint venture with Global Publishing and Walsh Global Management.

2006–07: Breakthrough and Shayne Ward[edit]
Main article: Shayne Ward (album)
Immediately after his victory on The X Factor, Ward signed a recording contract with Syco Music and his first single, "That's My Goal", was released in the UK on Wednesday, 21 December 2005. After selling 742,000 copies in the first week, including 313,000 on its first day, it became the Christmas number one single of 2005, held the top spot for four weeks and stayed in the top 75 until June 2006, a 21-week run. It became, at that time the fourth fastest-selling UK single of all time, beaten only by Elton John's "Candle in the Wind", Will Young's "Anything Is Possible/Evergreen", and Gareth Gates' "Unchained Melody" which sold 685,000, 403,000 and 335,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.[3] To date, "That's My Goal" has sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK. Ward also won an Ivor Nevello Award for being the Best Selling Single. Ward's second single, "No Promises", a cover of a Bryan Rice song was released on 10 April 2006, and peaked at number two (behind "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley) in the UK Singles Chart. Shayne Ward, his self-titled debut album was released on 17 April 2006. It sold 201,266 copies in the first week and entered the albums chart at number one. To date, the album has sold 520,000 copies in the UK and a further 2,000,000 worldwide, reaching number one in eight other countries. The album was certified platinum. Ward's third single was "Stand by Me". It was confirmed in Gary Barlow's autobiography My Take, that in 2006, fellow Take That member, Jason Orange threatened to quit the band, and Ward was seriously considered as his replacement. Orange, however, later changed his mind and a replacement was not required.[7] In August 2006, it was reported that Ward had developed vocal cord nodules – the same condition that stopped the singing career of Julie Andrews – and was to be flown out to Los Angeles in early September to see a specialist surgeon. His manager, Louis Walsh, released a statement that he was confident Ward would be fine and would be back at work by the end of the month. Ward had successful treatment and was indeed able to return to his singing career. In November 2006, he released his autobiography entitled My Story. He travelled to several places around the UK for book signings, which hundreds of people attended. In early 2007, Ward embarked on a solo tour of UK & Republic of Ireland venues, taking in eighteen concerts in twenty-eight days from late January to mid-February. The tour commenced in Dublin on 21 January and ended in Birmingham on 17 February 2007.
2007–08: Breathless[edit]
Main article: Breathless (Shayne Ward album)
After the completion of his successful debut tour, Ward's fourth single and first from his second album, "If That's OK with You" was given a release date of 20 August 2007, but was then delayed and became a double A-side single with "No U Hang Up". It was finally released on 24 September 2007, and charted at number two in the UK being held off by the Sugababes with "About You Now". "No U Hang Up" and "If That's OK with You" charted separately in Ireland, the former reaching number eleven and the latter entering at number one. Ward's second album, Breathless, was released on 26 November 2007, and after selling over 95,000 copies in its first week, debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, held off the top spot by his X Factor successor, Leona Lewis's, multi-platinum selling debut, Spirit. In Ireland, the album debuted at number one, removing Lewis's album from the top spot, a position it held for three weeks, and was later certified five times platinum. The second single from Ward's album was announced as "Breathless", and was released on 19 November 2007. It peaked at number six in the UK and number two in Ireland. On 10 November, Ward performed "Breathless" on the live results show of the fourth series of The X Factor, although the single was not available for download until 18 November, followed by a performance on The Paul O'Grady Show on 19 November. In the UK the album has been certified platinum with sales of over 450,000. In May 2008 Ward embarked on his month-long UK tour named The Breathless Tour 2008. He made his stage debut at London's O2 Arena and visited his home town Manchester at the MEN Arena. He also performed his complete show as a support act for Westlife's 2008 tour in front of a crowd of over 80,000 at Ireland's Croke Park. Ward also played on the opening night at The O2, Dublin, at the Cheerios Childline concert on 16 December 2008.
2008–11: Obsession[edit]
Main article: Obsession (Shayne Ward album)
Ward began working on his third album in 2009 with producers RedOne and Taio Cruz.[8] The album, titled Obsession, was released on 15 November 2010.[9] The singer worked with songwriters such as Savan Kotecha, Quiz & Larossi and Lucas Secon, while the songs produced by RedOne and Taio Cruz will not be included.[10] The first single from the album is a cover version of Nickelback's 2008 single, "Gotta Be Somebody".[11] Ward's version was released on 7 November 2010 and reached number 12 in the UK and number 10 in Ireland.[9] The video for the song premiered on 29 October 2010 and he performed the song on The X Factor on 7 November. Shayne also performed at the Miss World Pageant, which was held in Sanya, China. He did his first television appearance in over two years, on Live from Studio Five the day after his X Factor appearance, where he also performed his single. The album reached number 11 in Ireland on 19 November and peaked at number 15 in the UK on 21 November.

Listen from start to finish!Honorable Seller.This cd rocks. Have all 3 from this seller. Awesome. CD'S received new and within dates provided. Will buy from this seller again.kiss is well KISS what else can be saidExcept the fact that they are one of the most amazing bands to bring the heavy in to metal and the rock into rock and roll all over.. great package great music great soundVery enjoyableWhile "Harden My Heart" was and still is their best song, the other songs on this album are very good pop and have  held up over the years snce their breakup.A very classic, excellent rock albumAutumn Rain by John Lars Zwerenz was a surprising treat to hear in contrast to the many kinds of alternative choices I have on today's radio and in music stores.   Although obviously influenced by The Beatles' later period, this record of 15 or so songs delivers in melodic and harmonic ways in a manner I haven't heard since Nirvana.  The album is very varied and goes from pop to main stream rock to even classical, but there is never an anti climax musically.  I highly recommend Autumn Rain to all lovers of popular genres.   Kitty Roland, Denver, COThese men make business as usual work quite wellA good cd, lots of quirky rythms, kinetic keyboards and guitars, ringing tingles of the keyboard, almost like a pining of sorts, especially evident on the mega hit "Down Under", whose lyrics I never figured out how to connect with the music that accompanies it.  The faux flute sound heard there is nowhere else on the album, at least not as prominently.  Track 2 "I Can See it In Your Eyes" starts with a triumphant key stroke, almost like a rebel yell fist raise for the forlorn.  The songs are mostly high notes on the first 5 original album tracks, then take an increasingly dark turn as the album closes.  "Touching The Untouchables" has a bitterness to it, although sweet nonetheless, and then "Catch a Star", which is the 2nd to last song, continues on an even more better note, before "Down By The Sea" closes things out with a pounding swoosh like an evening tide.  There's a b-side and some otherr bonus tracs I haven't got around to listening to.  "Johnny B. Good" is kind of a dumb song, IMO, it seems to be a decrying of some people's disdain for "dreamers" in society, but just comes across as juvenile in its tone and structure.  Such complex subject matter should not be treated in such a simple matter.  "Underground" does a much better job at presenting its social criticisms because its not arguing with anybody except people who are probably too busy building their warchests to be taking time listening to this album in the first place, which is fine because the melody is pleasant regardless of how ultimately pointless the "preaching to the choir" lyrics may be.  Sure, it would be better if the men in this work would focus their attentions on deeper personal matters, things that they can speak firsthand about, i.e.: "from the heart", but this kind of music is mostly for entertainment, i.e.: mental stimulation.  If you want something to shake the heart and soul, look elsewhere.  There is an emotional component to this music, but isn't there always at least a shred of that?  Nonetheless, for what it is, it's quite good.  I think it holds up better than most of the stuff from 1981-1984.  And I think I can say so since I wasn't a teenager in 1985 or 1995 even.  My teen years were during this album's 15th anniversary and I remember hearing "Down Under" on the radio frequently back then.  A lot of music from this time period people insist holds up well just because they haven't forgotten about it or grown tired of it.  I do think this music fits with the 1990s better than it does the 2010s.  Ever since the Tea Party was sworn in, everyone's been so concerned about gay rights and women's rights and sexual politics is almost all you hear on the radio anymore.  There's some exceptions, obviously.  I probably don't keep up with modern radio music enough to say what's what.  I mostly listen to alternative rock with pop leanings, but the top songs on Spotify are almost entirely rap music with expletives galore.  I've probably gotten a little off topic here...thanks if you bothered to bear with me on that.  Really got nothing to say except if you're not sure you wanna buy this after reading this, try using Spotify, either on an internet browser or the app.  Good luck and g'night!Remastered versrsion is a must have!Led Zeppelin is a rock-n-roll category by itself! Here is a band that will never even be remotely reproduced. Instead what has been re-mastered is the Song Remains the 
Same and this version is a must have for all rock-n-roll fans. Recorded in 1975 at Madison Square Garden this CD is at about Led Zeppelin's peak and surely proves there is no other band like LZ!Sponsored LinksWhat's This?General RockPopHard RockArt RockAlt CountryRock & RollLead ArtistsBennett, TonyMoore, GaryTriumphFitzgerald, EllaJethro TullRichard, CliffAllan, DavieApril WineAriel Pink's Haunted GraffitiAslynBackstreet BoysBarclay James HarvestBayes, NoraBenatar, PatBoredomsBottom LineBrown, BosqueBrown, JuniorCary, CaitlinChicagoChixdiggit!Christie, TonyCochran, ToddColdplayCutler, IvorDays AwayDeathray DaviesDeep PurpleDelta Rhythm BoysDenny, SandyDionDirty ProjectorsEarl, KateEmbraceEpoxiesFantomasFineman, AlisaFlyleafFogGir, PineyGrand Funk RailroadGunHay, ColinHeadphonesHeavy TrashHowling DiablosIntangibleJohnstone, JudeKorekyojinLanghorne SlimLee, BrendaLee, Jake E.Levin, TonyLewis, Jerry LeeLounge Against The MachineLynne, JeffMae ShiMagnolia Electric Co.Matthews, Dave BandMaximo ParkMcKee, MariaMotion City SoundtrackMountain GoatsMuldaur, MariaNationalNo AddressOCSOf MontrealOkkervil RiverOneidaParker, GrahamPlanarPlanet ThePonysPower StationPresley, ElvisRaspberriesRatdogReddy, HelenRussell, JaneSavoy BrownSeetherSloanSpringfield, DustySquier, BillyStoneage HeartsTwinkleValens, RitchieVariousVetiverWakefieldWeigle, MarkWest, LeslieWilson, JulieYoakam, DwightBrandsPrecision SeriesClub CleanRSAUniversalBGOQCA Spas, Inc.N2USonyYour Pictured MemoriesCopperhead SinksDYOPick of the GlitterSimon Labels, Ltd.Hager HingeNeo NoodleDecoriteLauren by Ralph Lauren HandbagsMegaBRITEMonif C.Product For The CureCreativity For KidsEsterna3DconnexionBaby Lulu KidsDunecraftElmer- XactoEnergyJibbitz KidsKaenonLux De VilleRabbit Rabbit RabbitReminisceWes & Willy KidsClearsnapDisneyFreyGreggy Girl KidsInfinity SpasIrish SetterJasmineScarabeoSmashboxYoungbloodAEC MediaAWOL KidsAmbicoBacTrackBerne ApparelBluworldCarve DesignsChinese LaundryColumbiaDigital InnovationsDisney PrincessEurekaFast WeighFireSideGeorge MangGrace DigitalHydro-IndustriesIsabella CollectionJadoJump ApparelKentech LabsKnitting SoftwareKnomoLambs & IvyLawrence FramesLovcat HandbagsLove PollyManhattan PortageMarvelMiss A KitMorphine GenerationNikitaNo-CrankNorstarNukaP.R.PAQPEBBLES INCPiTechPinnaclePitney BowesPower StickPreceptPure SugarRadioactive GolfSPRISeatKaseSiegfriedSilktouchSnapperStayFitSteve DacriSuperga KidsTea Collection KidsTsongaUnited K9'sUp Side DownFormatsCompact DiscVinyl LPSuper Audio CD HybridDVDSuper Audio CDLPDVD-AudioDual Format CD-DVD7 Inch Vinyl SingleSort by:Sort ByBest SellingPrice Low - HighPrice High - LowAvg.

Wow, a great guy.Great CDThis CD plays instrumental music similar to baby einstein CD's.  It is wonderful.  It plays soothing soft baby rock and roll.HANSON ROCKS!This CD is great!! Hanson does a great job of Rocking out! Live and Electric features all of Hansons hits everyhting from MMMBop to Wheres The Love. Also included on this album is randitions of In A Little While and Optimistic! Hanson has unleashed another rocking album. HANSON ROCKS!!!Pink is SweetI like the album very much. Many of the songs rock. Since it is the PA verison, the age limitability is reasonable. Pink Rocks!!!Black Veil Brides - Set the World on FireThis is a great rock album. I originally heard the album on iTunes and went ahead and bought a physical copy of the album as well because I liked it so much.Finally, talentThis band has talent. If you are into Rock N Roll give it a shot.Rockin musicOur CD arrived quickly in great condition.  We are enjoying some new rock/blues from a new young artist.  We have always liked the classic rock, but there isn't really anything new.  Joe Bonamassa is a good listen, we look forward to seeing him live.GREAT BANDThis is a great Rock Bluesie band with a twist. True mature rock lovers will appreciate the talent.Great AlbumEvery song on this disk is a winner.  The final track, "Pretty Woman", iis truly special.  The backup artists are superstars in their own right:  Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, k.d. lang.  If you like classic rock and roll, you should love this album.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?FormatsVinyl LPCompact DiscSuper Audio CD HybridDVDLP7 Inch Vinyl SingleDual Format CD-DVDSuper Audio CDReleased12-FEB-1308-NOV-1105-FEB-0827-SEP-1110-NOV-0911-OCT-1117-NOV-0920-APR-1006-JUN-0607-JUN-1113-SEP-1105-APR-1126-JAN-1007-APR-0906-JAN-0908-MAY-1209-AUG-1118-OCT-1119-JUL-1122-SEP-0923-FEB-1022-NOV-1106-MAY-0818-JAN-1106-DEC-1107-FEB-1208-JUL-1613-MAY-1623-OCT-0701-NOV-1105-AUG-1613-OCT-0919-AUG-1629-JAN-1326-JUL-1126-JUN-1227-OCT-1405-JUN-1209-NOV-1027-OCT-0929-SEP-0908-JUN-1005-FEB-1306-APR-1012-JUL-1115-JUL-1615-NOV-1118-JUL-0621-AUG-0724-APR-1205-JUL-1105-OCT-1019-APR-1119-AUG-0820-DEC-1121-JUN-1122-JUL-1602-JAN-0103-APR-1215-SEP-0917-SEP-1318-SEP-1226-OCT-1028-SEP-1030-JUN-0904-OCT-1105-JAN-1007-AUG-1209-OCT-1211-MAY-1020-SEP-1125-SEP-1227-APR-1030-MAR-1015-APR-1620-OCT-0925-OCT-1102-OCT-1205-MAR-1308-SEP-0911-SEP-0712-APR-1112-OCT-1014-SEP-1015-OCT-1317-MAY-1119-JAN-1020-NOV-1221-OCT-0823-NOV-1028-APR-0929-NOV-1107-SEP-1012-AUG-1615-FEB-1116-MAR-1017-JUL-1218-MAY-1024-JUN-1611-SEP-12BrandsPrecision SeriesClub CleanRSAUniversalSonyMegaBRITEN2UPick of the GlitterSimon Labels, Ltd.ClearsnapDYODecoriteHager HingeQCA Spas, Inc.Rabbit Rabbit RabbitAWOL KidsBGOBacTrackCopperhead SinksCreativity For KidsDigital InnovationsElmer- XactoEnergyEsternaFireSideGeorge MangGrace DigitalInfinity SpasJump ApparelKaenonKnomoLawrence FramesManhattan PortageMiss A KitP.R.PinnaclePower StickProduct For The CureUnited K9'sVanguardWarnerWubbaNubadidas OriginalsSort by:Sort ByBest SellingPrice Low - HighPrice High - LowAvg.

Shayne Ward Is Selling Himself On Webcam to Fund His Next Album - VICE























































































































































Shayne Ward Is Selling Himself On Webcam to Fund His Next Album





The £50 he's charging his fans for ten minutes is nothing compared to the price of X-Factor's fast fame for its contestants. 
 Photo of Shane Ward via YouTube.  If you're lonely and need someone to talk to, or if somehow you cannot find it in your heart to forget the 2005 winner of the second series of The X Factor, then I have a cracking deal for you. Shayne Ward, he of eponymous Shayne Ward  2006 album fame, is available to talk to you on Skype for ten minutes, for the price of £50.  News of Shayne's descent has served as backhanded press for his new album, called Closer, to be released this coming April. He's crowdfunding it through a site called PledgeMusic where, for £113, you can buy Shayne's cardigan by a brand called "Izzue", for £5000 you can have a private Shayne show, and for £50 you can purchase those ten sexy minutes on Skype.  It's a troubling career move for the man who had the UK's third-fastest selling single of all time, That'sMy Goal, which stayed in the charts a full 21 weeks. (Nope, me neither.) PledgeMusic, for all the independence it grants artists, marks a curious new level of licenced privacy invasion, with celebrities selling their time, their phone numbers and levels of access in the manner of cam girls. With auctions for clothes, pictures and the space in his album liner notes, it's hard not to think that Shayne Ward's star has crashed to earth and he's selling off pieces of the rubble. Then again, Ward has always belonged, in a sense, to the public, as with any product of a TV talent show. In his first appearance on X Factor back in 2005, he's a 20-year-old shop assistant wearing baggy bleached denim and giant cubic zirconia earrings. "I like the fact that you don't look stage school", says Simon, smelling the possibility of money. "You look real." It's a gorgeously creepy thing to tell one of the earlier stars of reality TV. Ward was blandly agreeable as the X Factor's second winner, a crewcut, silky-voiced vision of generic masculinity groomed to triumph over Andy Abraham. It was acknowledged from the start that he would trade on his looks, hamming it up in a succession of topless calendar shoots which remain in production to this day (it's not too late, readers – 2015's calendar features Ward in a wet t shirt!).    Ward forever treads the line between Mancunian-next-door and campy, oiled-up Adonis, catering to young gay men and straight women as well as their mothers. In pictures he is forever pulling his clothes off, or inexplicably getting them wet. In some, Ward's shirt and jumper appear to have been awkwardly photoshopped back on again, while in others he is drowning in knitwear. He served as an early prototype for the peculiar brand of twee male objectification allowed for in TV talent shows: Matt Cardle, Gareth Gates, Will Young, Jedward, Joe McElderry... a succession of inoffensive boys who ran succinctly alongside the show's female "divas". The line reaches its apex in Harry Styles, and its nadir in Frankie Cocozza (who's a delight on Twitter, by the way).  Many of these TV boy-men have since vanished. Where do you go after you've sold your life's story by way of introduction, after you've given away, as Louis Walsh put it, "one million percent"? It's as if we knew from the start that Shayne and his ilk were one-trick acts, indulging them as Christmas number ones with seasonal goodwill.     None of the X-Factor's stars ever tried to keep their lives secret from the press: they gave their stories away early, accelerating the process of getting to know them. Before reality TV we were allowed to grow up with pop stars and follow them from their inception on crappy soaps or children's daytime TV to international stardom. The X Factor, along with its precursor Popstars, condensed this process into short, hyper-emotional TV cycles, sealing the deal with the overpriced phone call you inevitably made to vote.  We'd grow tired of their products similarly quickly, leaving former stars relying on overpriced Skype calls to get by. X Factor has bred so many lower-tier celebrities that no tabloid can contain them. Perhaps Ward owes it to his fans to remain accessible, and perhaps we owe it to him to pay for his too-tight designer shirts.  Photo of Simon Cowell via Wiki Commons  Dissent in the X Factor ranks is minimal, even long after their fame fades and Simon Cowell's Syco label drops them. Even after he was excluded from X Factor's ten year reunion show along with Leon Jackson, Matt Cardle and Series 1 winner Steve Brookstein, Ward claimed that he was "not bitter". Brookstein only voiced his complaints a decade later in his book, Getting Over the X, which sold with a quote printed on the cover from Max Clifford: "Talk to the press and we'll bury you." He has since taken to Twitter to attack Louis Tomlinson and his legion of rabid fans, as if leveraging the public's X Factor bitterness into a surrogate career.  For all the ups and downs of his career, Ward appears to have remained a good egg. Last year was a busy one for him: he turned 30, posed for his calendar and Attitude magazine, recorded an album due for release this year, and starred in a stage production of War of the Worlds alongside Brian McFadden and Jason Donovan. In September he judged a girl band contest in Manchester, where he was billed in a newspaper as "Ex Factor"'s Shayne Ward.  Shayne Ward's Twitter profile has a blue verified tick and 262k followers. Even if only a fraction of that figure are hardcore, he retains a steady fan base. PledgeMusic, the "Direct-to-Fanplatform" facilitating his Skype calls and wardrobe sale, crowdfunds artists without retaining rights to their music. Its list of alumni and current users is bafflingly varied, ranging from Peter Andre to Erasure to Stiff Little Fingers to LCD Soundsystem. They claim a 90 percent success rate.  Maybe it's not so ignoble a fate, to sell your time in ten minute increments. Maybe Ward is just one facet of modern celebrity, where it's acceptable to crowdfund a tour and weather the criticism, or blithely practise the "art of asking" more than you practise your actual songs. Music has regressed into a form of high-profile busking: it's needy, but commendably independent at the same time. Beyonce even nods to her past in TV talent shows at the beginning of "Flawless", if only to stamp all over it later with a hymn to her own power.  Whether a celebrity selling their time on Skype a sign of humility, or one last hubristic act of delusion, it's hard to grudge them a certain pragmatism. Ward always had the ear of the public, and he still does today. It just happens to be one ear at a time now.  @RoisinTheMirror  More stuff like this:   Man or Woman, Bruce Jenner Is a Human Being   What Kind of Politician Would Jeremy Kyle Be?
