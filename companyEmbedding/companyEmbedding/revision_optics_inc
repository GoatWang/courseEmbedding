CAUTION: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician.
ATTENTION: Please see Professional Use Information and/or Patient Information Brochure for a complete list of Potential Risks, of Indications and Warnings and Precautions.
INDICATIONS FOR USE: The Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay is indicated for intrastromal implantation to improve near vision in the non-dominant eye of phakic, presbyopic patients, 41 to 65 years of age, who have manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) of +1.00 diopters (D) to -0.50 D with less than or equal to 0.75 D of refractive cylinder, who do not require correction for clear distance vision, but who do require near correction of +1.50 D to +2.50 D of reading add.
SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION
The Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay may not eliminate the need for reading glasses.
Implantation of the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay has the potential to cause vision and eye symptoms; dry eyes; decreased vision; decreased contrast sensitivity; problems with the cornea, such as clouding, thinning, scarring, and inflammation; eye infection; increased eye pressure; and the need for another eye surgery, such as removal or replacement of the inlay, or other treatment.
You should not have the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay implanted if you have severe dry eye; have an active eye infection or active inflammation; have signs of corneal disease characterized by general thinning and cone-shaped protrusion in the center of the cornea (keratoconus) or keratoconus suspect; have abnormal features of the outer part of the eye (cornea) to be implanted; have active abnormal immune response (autoimmune) or connective tissue diseases; do not have enough corneal thickness to safely have the procedure performed; have a recent herpes eye infection or problems resulting from a previous infection; have uncontrolled build-up of high pressure in the eye (glaucoma); have uncontrolled high blood sugar (diabetes).
There are non-surgical alternatives to the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay, which include reading glasses or contact lenses.
Before having the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay procedure you should have a complete eye examination and talk with your eye care provider about alternative treatments, potential benefits, complications, risks, healing time, and any other concerns you have about having the procedure.

ReVision Optics, Inc. Announces Receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval for its Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the Surgical Correction of Presbyopia
Aug 18 16
ReVision Optics, Inc. announced receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the surgical correction of presbyopia on June 29, 2016. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is comprised of approximately 80% water and has a refractive index very similar to the cornea. It is placed in the cornea of the non-dominant eye during a 10-minute procedure and is transparent, therefore does not restrict the amount of light reaching the retina. The reshaping of the anterior curvature of the cornea improves near vision. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay has received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, authorization to affix the CE Mark for the European Union, license approval by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea), approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia), and registration with the Medicines and Medical Safety Authority (New Zealand). Other country-specific registrations are pending.

Age Related Near Vision Loss










What is Age Related Near Vision Loss?
Age related near vision loss, or presbyopia, is caused by a naturally occurring loss of elasticity in the eye. When the lens inside of your eye loses elasticity it becomes difficult for your eye to refocus on objects that are up close, making everyday tasks like reading menus or your phone a challenge.
Signs and Symptoms of Presbyopia
As we age near vision issues can happen seemingly overnight, or can be more gradual. More often than not, people compensate by moving hard to see items further away to attempt to focus on smaller print or details. Over time most people suffering from presbyopia need reading glasses to focus on smaller and more detailed objects.

Understanding Your Eyes
Aging doesn’t have to stop us from doing what we want, and having a clear understanding of the way the human eye ages naturally is important when talking about presbyopia. Over time the lens of your eye hardens making it difficult for your eye to change shape and focus on closer items. Presbyopia happens naturally and can affect anyone over 40.
Treatment Options
There is a wide array of treatment options for those suffering from presbyopia and near vision loss. While other options are available, Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay is an ideal option for those tired of struggling with glasses and contacts.
Reading glasses: The most common solution for those suffering presbyopia is reading glasses. While reading glasses are generally an inexpensive way to treat the loss of near vision, continually having to upgrade reading glass strength and losing eyewear can actually be costly in the long run. This can also be a maintenance heavy solution, as scrambling to find and remember eyewear can be frustrating.
Contact lenses: While those who don’t like the look of readers can find contact lenses more cosmetically appealing, not all people can tolerate or look forward to putting something like a contact lens in their eye. While contact lenses are relatively inexpensive over time with purchasing lenses, changing prescriptions and continual doctors visits can add up. Contacts are available for monovision, which means one contact will be prescribed for near vision and the other for distance vision, or multifocals options. With cases and solution, both traveling and day to day life can be inconvenienced by contact lenses.
Monovision LASIK: While Monovision LASIK works for some, others have trouble tolerating the procedure as one eye is treated for near vision and the other for distance vision, causing an imbalance. While the procedure is a relatively low-maintenance and long term solution for those suffering from presbyopia, it is also an expensive option for something that you may not be able to tolerate without vision or health issues. 
Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay: Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay is a small, transparent, curved disc called an inlay. It’s made of approximately 80% water and from material similar to a soft contact lens. It is a great option for those looking to have a fuller range of vision as the inlay offers near and immediate vision improvement, with results typically seen within one week. Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay offers a simple solution to the often pesky maintenance associated with glasses and contacts as well.

INDICATIONS FOR USE AND SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE RAINDROP® NEAR VISION INLAY
CAUTION: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician.
ATTENTION: Please see Professional Use Information and/or Patient Information Brochure for a complete list of Potential Risks, of Indications and Warnings and Precautions.
INDICATIONS FOR USE: The Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay is indicated for intrastromal implantation to improve near vision in the non-dominant eye of phakic, presbyopic patients, 41 to 65 years of age, who have manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) of +1.00 diopters (D) to -0.50 D with less than or equal to 0.75 D of refractive cylinder, who do not require correction for clear distance vision, but who do require near correction of +1.50 D to +2.50 D of reading add.
SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION
The Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay may not eliminate the need for reading glasses.
Implantation of the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay has the potential to cause vision and eye symptoms; dry eyes; decreased vision; decreased contrast sensitivity; problems with the cornea, such as clouding, thinning, scarring, and inflammation; eye infection; increased eye pressure; and the need for another eye surgery, such as removal or replacement of the inlay, or other treatment.
You should not have the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay implanted if you have severe dry eye; have an active eye infection or active inflammation; have signs of corneal disease characterized by general thinning and cone-shaped protrusion in the center of the cornea (keratoconus) or keratoconus suspect; have abnormal features of the outer part of the eye (cornea) to be implanted; have active abnormal immune response (autoimmune) or connective tissue diseases; do not have enough corneal thickness to safely have the procedure performed; have a recent herpes eye infection or problems resulting from a previous infection; have uncontrolled build-up of high pressure in the eye (glaucoma); have uncontrolled high blood sugar (diabetes).
There are non-surgical alternatives to the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay, which include reading glasses or contact lenses.
Before having the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay procedure you should have a complete eye examination and talk with your eye care provider about alternative treatments, potential benefits, complications, risks, healing time, and any other concerns you have about having the procedure.

PRESS RELEASE
ReVision Optics, Inc. (RVO), an ophthalmic surgical products company, recently received $35 million in capital funding. The Lake Forest, Calif.-based firm specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of custom products to correct and maintain near vision.
The financing was led by ProQuest Investments, a venture capital firm with locations in San Diego, Calif., Montreal, Canada and Princeton, N.J. Returning investors include Domain Associates of San Diego, Calif., and Princeton, N.J., Canaan Partners of Westport, Conn., and Menlo Park, Calif., and InterWest Partners of Dallas, Texas, and Menlo Park, Calif.
This spring RVO began US clinical trials of its PresbyLens® corneal inlay. This in-depth trial will evaluate the PresbyLens® corneal inlay for the correction of presbyopia by studying 400 patients over a two-year period.
It is estimated that more than 73 million adults currently have presbyopia in the US. Presbyopia is a common vision condition that affects all adults as they age. Typically, adults in their mid 40s begin to experience presbyopic symptoms as the natural lens of the eye loses its flexibility and ability to focus on near objects. Adults with good distance vision may begin to notice they now have a hard time reading things close up like newspapers, menus or computer screens. 





RVO’s PresbyLens® has the ability to reshape the eye’s cornea and improve the patient’s reading or near vision. The 2mm microlens was developed using a proprietary, biocompatible material similar to the material used in today’s soft contact lenses.
“We are pleased to welcome ProQuest Investments as one of our venture capital partners along with our existing investors as we begin our clinical trials here in the United States and debut the procedure in the European marketplace. It is encouraging and exciting to have this support from all of our investors as we continue to research and develop a solution for the common aging eye condition of presbyopia,” said J. Randy Alexander, President and CEO of ReVision Optics.
ABOUT REVISION OPTICS:
ReVision Optics™, Inc., (RVO) is a privately held corporation headquartered in Southern California. The company’s main focus is the research and development of custom optical solutions dedicated to vision correction.
RVO’s first product is the PresbyLens®* inlay, a unique patented refractive surgery solution. This inlay is designed to improve the near vision that has been lost by the eye’s natural aging process called presbyopia. The PresbyLens® inlay is removable, and provides an ideally suited surgical option for near and intermediate vision enhancement.

Revision's Teamine Eye Complex is loaded with active ingredients, including: pentapeptides, soy peptides, green tea extract, horse chestnut, caffeine, vitamin K and arnica.
Another customer favorite is Revision's Intellishade SPF45. This truly "intelligent" SPF product not only moisturizers and protects the skin, it actually improves the skin's condition with tripeptide, vitamin C, green tea extract, and Co-Q10. Revision Intellishade is a mineral, tinted sunscreen that provides sheer coverage and adapts itself to almost every skin tone. As of 2011 Intellishade is also available in a matte finish.
Another award-winning product from Revision is Nectifirm, a cream that firms & tightens slackened skin by as much as 40%...in as little as 28 days. Nectifirm is widely known to be the best-selling firming cream for the neck available anywhere. It reduces crepey appearance, increases skin's elastic and reduces the appearance of adiose tissue (fat) in the jowl area and chin.
Revision also takes precautions to be sure they have minimal impact on the environment and do not deplete any natural resources. Furthermore, materials used for packaging and marketing are selected based on their ability to be recycled.

The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is a novel corneal inlay for the surgical correction of presbyopia, which is a natural part of the aging process that decreases the ability of the eye to focus on near objects.“It’s exciting to reach this milestone, moreover within eight months of our commercial launch. It’s even more exciting to improve the lives of those who previously struggled with everyday tasks like reading menus or seeing items on their smartphones,” said John Kilcoyne, ReVision Optics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “More Americans are seeking out options to reduce the hassle of reading glasses by correcting presbyopia through outpatient procedures. The Raindrop Inlay is clearly a terrific option for those patients wanting to improve near vision and live life with a full range of vision.“We are delighted with the reception our Raindrop Inlay has received from the ophthalmic community,” said Mr. Kilcoyne. “We now have 90+ surgeons performing the procedure and are processing requests for training daily. Results of our monthly survey for March 2017 of surgeons performing the procedure are typical of the responses we’ve received to date, with 100% indicating they would likely recommend the procedure to another surgeon and 94% saying they were satisfied with patient outcomes following the procedure.”The Raindrop is a clear, biocompatible inlay that is placed in the non-dominant eye in a 10-minute outpatient procedure. The inlay is about the size of a pinhead and is less than half the thickness of a human hair. It mimics the properties of the natural cornea and changes the central curvature of the eye to improve near vision. ReVision Optics is commercializing the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay through a comprehensive marketing campaign and a commercial sales organization comprised of sales representatives and clinical outcomes specialists.ReVision Optics also announces plans to participate in two upcoming ophthalmic conferences. Mr. Kilcoyne will participate on a panel reviewing the scope of disruptive presbyopia technologies and their current market penetration at the Ophthalmic Innovation Summit (OIS) on May 4, 2017. The conference, which is expected to be attended by approximately 700 clinicians, industry representatives and investors, will be held at the Sheraton in downtown Los Angeles.  ReVision Optics will showcase the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay on the exhibition floor at the joint American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) and American Society of Ophthalmic Administrators (ASOA) Symposium & Congress being held May 5-9, at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The ASCRS ASOA Symposium and Congress is expected to be the largest U.S. meeting integrating a scientific program dedicated to the needs of the anterior segment specialist with the leading practice management program for comprehensive ophthalmology and subspecialties. The ReVision Optics’ display will be at booth #2936. About the Raindrop Near Vision InlayThe Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is placed in the cornea of the non-dominant eye during a 10-minute procedure. The Raindrop is comprised of approximately 80% water and has a refractive index very similar to the cornea. It is transparent and therefore does not restrict the amount of light reaching the retina. The reshaping of the anterior curvature of the cornea improves near vision.The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay has received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, authorization to affix the CE Mark for the European Union, license approval by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea), approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia) and registration with the Medicines and Medical Safety Authority (New Zealand). Other country-specific registrations are pending.About ReVision OpticsReVision Optics, Inc. focuses on the development and commercialization of innovative optical solutions dedicated to presbyopic vision correction. The company’s Raindrop Near Vision Inlay offers a unique, patented refractive surgery solution. The Raindrop improves near vision that has been lost through the eye’s natural aging process called presbyopia. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay provides a new surgical option for near-vision enhancement.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170404005098/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderRepublicans warn Trump: No confirmation hearing for a Sessions replacement, and no recess appointment eitherBusiness InsiderTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderAmazon wobble ripples across world stock marketsReutersThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredMerck profit beats as Keytruda sales soar, expenses dropReutersAmazon could be the first trillion dollar company: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoHow grocers feel about Amazon: 'There was a lot of fear before, there's a lot more fear now'Yahoo Finance"Women Need To Carry This Device With Them"Siren SongSponsoredRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceAmazon ploughs ahead with high sales and spending; profit plungesReutersRussia orders cut in US diplomats in reaction to sanctionsDirk: Gosh, I hope this doesn't lead Russia to deny America of all the Russian cars, Russian electronics, Russian textiles and all other Russian products that we consume.

You should not have the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay implanted if you have severe dry eye; have an active eye infection or active inflammation; have signs of corneal disease characterized by general thinning and cone-shaped protrusion in the center of the cornea (keratoconus) or keratoconus suspect; have abnormal features of the outer part of the eye (cornea) to be implanted; have active abnormal immune response (autoimmune) or connective tissue diseases; do not have enough corneal thickness to safely have the procedure performed; have a recent herpes eye infection or problems resulting from a previous infection; have uncontrolled build-up of high pressure in the eye (glaucoma); have uncontrolled high blood sugar (diabetes).
There are non-surgical alternatives to the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay, which include reading glasses or contact lenses.
Before having the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay procedure you should have a complete eye examination and talk with your eye care provider about alternative treatments, potential benefits, complications, risks, healing time, and any other concerns you have about having the procedure.

ReVision Optics, Inc. Raises $25M in Series D Financing




Domain Associates Leads Round; Will Join Board of Directors






April 30, 2007 05:33 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ReVision Optics, Inc., a leading company in the development, 
      manufacturing and marketing of implantable products to correct and 
      maintain vision, today announced that it has successfully raised $25 
      million in a Series D financing led by Domain Associates, with 
      additional investments from existing investors Canaan Partners and 
      InterWest Partners. Brian H. Dovey, partner at Domain Associates, will 
      join the board of directors. ReVision Optics, Inc. targets the 
      refractive surgery market with an emphasis on the surgical correction of 
      presbyopia.
    


“With this financing, we have achieved another 
      important milestone in establishing the leadership and innovation of 
      ReVision Optics,” said J. Randy Alexander, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of ReVision Optics, Inc. “We 
      are particularly pleased that Domain Associates led this round and has 
      joined our existing investors in supporting the rapid advancement of 
      ReVision Optics’ product development. We 
      welcome Brian Dovey to the board of directors and look forward to his 
      invaluable support.”


      Presbyopia is a common vision problem in the United States, currently 
      affecting more than 73 million people. The PRESBYLENSTM 
      by ReVision Optics gently reshapes the cornea to correct a patient’s 
      near vision. This lens is made from a proprietary optically clear, 
      bio-compatible material that mimics the properties of the cornea, and is 
      removable. In recent clinical trials, the PRESBYLENSTM, 
      appears to provide positive patient outcomes.
    

“We believe that ReVision’s 
      PRESBYLENSTM technology is an important 
      development in the fast-growing ophthalmology space and one of the few 
      focused on treating the loss of near vision in a minimally invasive 
      fashion. We, along with Canaan and InterWest, look forward to helping 
      ReVision’s management team develop this 
      exciting technology and build this company,” 
      said Brian Dovey, Partner, Domain Associates and member of the ReVision 
      Optics board of directors.
    

      ReVision Optics is presently conducting clinical trials off shore for 
      the PRESBYLENSTM. The company will be 
      introducing an IDE in the third quarter of 2007.
    

“As the baby-boom generation lives longer, 
      more active lives, advances to correct eyesight are required. ReVision 
      Optics is addressing this growing medical problem with innovative 
      products that bring together leading-edge material science with surgical 
      procedures,” said Wende Hutton, Venture 
      Partner, Canaan Partners and member of the ReVision Optics board of 
      directors. “We are excited that Domain 
      Associates shares our enthusiasm for ReVision Optics’ 
      important work and has led this round of financing.”


“The PRESBYLENSTM 
      from ReVision Optics has the potential to be the correction of choice 
      for the near vision problems encountered by everyone over age 45,” 
      said Gil Kliman M.D., General Partner, InterWest Partners and Chairman 
      of the ReVision Optics board of directors. “The 
      high quality customized optics enable immediate clear vision at distance 
      and near for patients of all ages, with major advantages over bifocals, 
      contact lenses, and experimental surgical approaches. With the addition 
      of Domain Associates to our investor group we now have the resources in 
      place to bring this innovative product to market.”
