Self-driving vehicles relieve the burden of material movement so your workforce can focus on higher value activities.






Overcome Labour ShortagesOne OTTO can work three shifts, seven days a week.



Recover WastedFloor SpaceOTTO reduces the time materials are in motion, freeing up floor space.


            
Standardize Across All FacilitiesThe best processes in  each facility can be shared with all facilities.


       
Get Real-Time Insights AnywhereMetrics about OTTO can report on productivity and uncover lean opportunities.






The evolution of material transport.A Self Driving Vehicle (SDV) utilizes laser-based perception and artificial intelligence to dynamically move through facilities, infrastructure-free. SDVs combine the benefits of manual labor, conveyors, and AGVs to provide the most advanced method of material transport available today.
This should be small under the big header!




  Group 15 Created with Sketch.          Flexibility   Labor   Conveyors   Efficiency   Safety   SDVs   Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)     


Manual labor is the most flexible method of material handling available today. It can be challenging to hire and retain workers, but carts and fork trucks are simple and proven.


Conveyors are a highly efficient and productive means of transporting high volumes of goods between manufacturing stations and production lines.


AGVs follow fixed, predefined paths to transport materials from origin to destination. They rely on guidance devices such as magnetic tape, beacons, or bar codes that allow the AGV to travel on fixed paths in a controlled space, making them a safe alternative to traditional material transport.












Finally, automation thatadapts with your business.Industrial facilities must constantly adapt to changing global forces to remain competitive. The OTTO Platform is built on the principles of freedom and flexibility to modify your automation as frequently as your floor changes.

The Kitchener-based robotics company has officially announced the launch of its online store. There’s a line of innovative products for autonomous systems as well as some products for research and development. Some of the parts and bots on offer include 2D and 3D laser scanners, internal measurement units (IMUs), cameras and even full robotic learning kits. Clearpath typically provides robotics components as an original equipment manufacturer solution for their extensible mobile robots, customers can now purchase their own components for the first time through this online store. “We are thrilled to partner with industry leaders to allow our customers to source robotics components and sensors easily and efficiently all in one place,” said Julian Ware, research solutions general manager for Clearpath Robotics in a press release. Prices range from just over $1000 for a bare essentials Turtlebot kit, all the way to “request quote” for some of the internal units and haptic controllers. This essentially means you will have to work a pretty swanky day job to afford these things as a hobby. At least now some new entrepreneurs can see what it costs to bring robotics into their startup and what level of automation they can afford. Clearpath Robotics is a leader in unmanned vehicle robotics and provides hardware, software and services to enable self-driving vehicle development, deployment and operation. Late last year they raised $30 million to expand their indoor self driving vehicle market.

Bryan Webb
COO/CFO
Guarding the Clearpath wallet with quiet ferocity, Bryan can crunch numbers and whip up complicated contracts full of impressive legal jargon – all while growing a shockingly lustrous mustache.
As CFO/COO and Co-Founder of Clearpath, Bryan is responsible for Finance, Manufacturing, IT and HR. Through his ability to implement lean operational policies and initiate a market-led business model, Clearpath achieved break-even within 18 months of its inception – Bryan was able to stretch the company’s initial $360,000 equity financing over four years while the team grew from 4 to 34. Bryan has raised millions of dollars in equity, managed debt and grants, relocated the business to a 30,000 sq ft facility and navigated a doubling of the team. He now focuses on strengthening the company’s business model with long-term contracts.
 
 
 





Ryan Gariepy

Great Products Are Built By Small Teams That
Work Hard, Think Smart, And Move Fast.
 
 
 
 





IN THE BEGINNING
Clearpath was started in a basement by four friends who loved building robots in university. After experiencing their own frustrations in the lab, they wanted to make robotics research easier. Persisting, failing, iterating and finally succeeding on the build of their first unmanned vehicle, Clearpath Robotics was born.


 


TODAY WE’RE DIFFERENT, BUT STILL THE SAME

Since then, the company has grown. We have robots and customers all over the world. Our offices are bigger and we have real desks, but we’ve held on to the spirit with which we began: be genuine, listen to customers, and keep it beautifully simple. Our team is passionate about building robots for the greater good. We love to problem solve, make innovative ideas a reality, and play the occasional game of frisbee over lunch. We’re the leader in research robotics and blazing the trail for robots in industry. Ready to be a part of it?

Inspire confidence and admiration in every interaction someone has with Clearpath. Surprise and delight customers in strange and interesting ways. Execute with obsession to detail.







 
 
 




CUSTOMER FIRST





Focus on customer happiness and always put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Understand customer needs better than they understand themselves. Deliver a remarkable experience at every opportunity. Provide a consistent experience as we grow.







 
 



NO BULLSHIT









Results matter, job titles don’t. Do what you say. Respect the person, but don’t let bad ideas go unchallenged. Always be honest, direct and transparent. Tackle difficult conversations head-on.











 
 
 




THINK BIG







Anticipate where we’re going and invest in systems that scale – help us build for the future! Encourage crazy ideas, volunteer for impossible situations, and don’t be afraid to go against the grain. Learn lots and grow quickly.









 
 



BE HUMBLE









Everybody has something to learn. Seek first to understand, then be understood. Push yourself to become better.











 
 
 




MOVE FAST









Use processes to automate everything you can. Break rules when necessary. Don’t ask for permission if you can stand firm behind your decision. Analyze failure and learn from it. Get shit done.











 
 



BE FRUGAL











Profit is the engine that lets us achieve our goals. Make smart investments. If we do more with less, we can do more. Spend it like it’s yours.













 
 
 




EMPOWER OTHERS











Create heroes. Give constructive feedback quickly. Go the extra mile for your teammates. Be a teacher.
