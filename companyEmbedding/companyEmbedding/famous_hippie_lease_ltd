Woodstock is not only one of the most famous music festivals of all time, it was also one of the defining moments of the 1960s counter-culture movement.What started as a free event advertised for 50,000, quickly turned into one of the most important music festival in history, attended by over half a million people, united in a message of peace, love, openness and cultural expression.Rolling Stone magazine’s first photographer Baron Wolman was sent to Max Yasgur's farm in the Catskills, upstate New York, to cover the festival and now 45 years later he has released a book featuring previously unreleased photographs of the era-defining event.

Rolling Stone magazine¿s first photographer Baron Wolman was sent to Max Yasgur's farm in the Catskills, upstate New York, to cover the festival and now 45 years later he has released a book featuring previously unreleased photographs of the era-defining event
 ‘No one could have predicted the enduring influence of the Woodstock experience,’ said Wolman, now 76. ‘Yes, the bands were first rate and there were many of them. And the setting … was picture perfect and tranquil, a bucolic setting for relaxing with friends and listening to music and getting high. But in unexpected ways, Woodstock became more than a concert for all of us.’

Although assigned with a brief to photograph what was happening on stage, Wolman found himself more inspired by the crowds of hippies than the performers.‘I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening “out there” was just too interesting not to explore.’

'I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening "out there" was just too interesting not to explore,' said Wolman
  






During the sometimes rainy weekend, 32 acts performed outdoors before an audience of over 500,000 young people at Max Yasgur's 600-acre dairy farm in the Catskills
  






The influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam
 More interested in the crowd than the performers, his photographs are hugely evocative and offer an insight into this legendary event that is rarely seen. ‘The thing to remember about the 1960s, even near the end in ‘69 was that everything was totally different, the behavior was new and unexpected. 'Plus, the 1960s were simply wildly photogenic in every way imaginable ... the changes that were taking place in the heads of the people were visually manifested. I mean, how could you not take pictures?’ Released to commemorate the 45th anniversary, Woodstock features Wolman's stunning black and white photographs, the majority of which are published for the first time.The images perfectly capture the zeitgeist, the music, the drugs, the people, the sheer hedonism; the enduring legacy of the most famous festival ever.

The event was captured in the 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying soundtrack album, and Joni Mitchell's song Woodstock, which commemorated the event and became a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young
 The book also features a foreword by musician Carlos Santana and a Q&A with Wolman and Woodstock creator, Michael Lang, who share their personal experiences of Woodstock. Also included is Wolman’s contact sheets in their entirety, including outtakes. ‘It is a rare and fascinating treat when photographers allow us to see their contact sheets,’ said contributor Dave Brolan. ‘What is remarkable about this selection of contact sheets is that almost every frame is as good as the next, and we get to see Woodstock exactly as Baron saw it, every single unbelievable moment.’Wolman began the music phase of his photographic career in 1967, as the very first photographer for the new Rolling Stone magazine. He went on to capture the 60s pop rock explosion, including: Janis Joplin, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan amongst many more. ‘I see myself as a kind of voyeur … I’m happiest when I’m invisible and watching. … I’m a chameleon and can adapt myself to the situation, and that, to me, is one of the gifts that I was given naturally, and that’s how you get honest pictures.’Woodstock by Baron Wolman is published by Reel Art Press

Vintage Hair Adverts: 1960s-70s Products, Styles and Tragic Cuts

By Yeoman Lowbrow on 2 January 2015 | comments 3



Share this:  

Flashbak is no stranger to the world of vintage hair (ex. From Bouffant to Farrah: The Glory Days of Big, Big Hair ); after all, what fashion statement better represents a particular era better than hairstyles?  Today, we’re focusing on advertising proclaiming their new amazing hair solutions.  Wonders await…
 
Scatter Perm 1969
What should have been done with rollers, was done with permanence – you’d be stuck with these curls for god-knows-how long.  One can only imagine the hair disasters that resulted.  (And, yes, that’s my childhood crush, Erin Grey.)
 
1969 Command Hair Styling Gel
Because cool dudes use hair spray, play chess with themselves, and keep their women in darkened corners.
 
1971 Great Body
Yes, it’s amazing what a difference actually washing and drying your hair will do.
 
1965 Ronson shaver
The tagline at bottom: “Remember, Ronson does a lot more than light cigarettes.”   Wait – what?   How cool would this be, if it was part shaver, part lighter?
 
1974 Brylcreem
“Sideburns that extend beyond the bottom of the earlobe are too long for 1974. Sorry. Sideburns are closer to your head this year.”
Elvis would disagree.
 

I’m sure there’s a lot of interesting information here, but I just can’t take my eyes off those shorts and those amazing socks.
 
The next three are from a 1968 issue of Playboy presenting the wonders of fake mustaches, sideburns and beards.   This simply has to be seen to be believed….

“Clean shaven urbanites are sporting false facial foliage that can be whisked on for a party and, if necessary, whisked off for working hours.”
Was this ever really a thing?
 

“Right on time for a pressing engagement, the young man has the situation well in hand; he’s hirsutably adorned in traditional boot sideburns, about $60.”
“Before an elegant dinner a deux, he caters to his date’s whimsy for whiskers by serving up a stylish side order of muttonchop sideburns, about $100.”

“The gentleman cultivates an even more sophisticated image – a look that this blonde definitely prefers – by favoring a Freudulent Vandyke, about $80.”
“As a swashbuckler, our man comes on strong in a mariner’s beard, about $100.  All stick-on shrubbery available by mail from Hollywood Joe’s, NYC.”
 

These Star Glow wigs are awesome, but short lived – the afro was just around the corner.  (For more on afros check out my Top Ten.)
 
1961 FITCH Dandruff Remover
This is pretty a cool – an advert illustrated by Syd Hoff, the man behind Danny and the Dinosaur (1958) and so much more (even his own TV show).
 

Okay, now that you’ve got my attention with the tan topless sunbather, what were you saying?
 
1977 Clairol
1977 Breck Clean Rinse
Recognize this girl?  It’s Glynnis O’Connor.  She was in Jeremy (1973) and Ode to Billy Joe  (1976), but I remember her best in the John Travolta masterpiece, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.
 

Charlie Hustle’s cut was a thing of wonder in the 1970s.  Also, I hope this lady is carrying mace, because this is the locker room of The Big Red Machine – things are liable to get unruly.
 
1962-Clairol Shampoo
I must admit, I had to Google Mr. Kenneth.  Apparently, he was the first celebrity hairstylist, credited with inventing Jacqueline Kennedy’s bouffant in 1961.
 
1969 Kindness hairsetter
“…five million dollars. And to my devoted wife Elizabeth, a Kindness Instant Hairsetter.”
 

What sort of giant mound of foam has this girl created?  This is some serious lather!
 

Style M-103, made specifically for resentful douchebags.  Style M-116 for your confident serial killer, and Style M-107 for when you want to go full retard.
