Ask An Expert

What is the “typical” home buyers are purchasing?
Each year, the National Association of Realtors® reports its insights into the characteristics of the homes purchased across the United States the previous year. Last year, 83% of the homes purchased were detached single family homes. There was only a median of 12 miles between the homes that recent buyers purchased and the homes that they moved from. Heating and cooling costs were the most important environmental features for recent buyers, with 84% finding these features at least somewhat important. For buyers 36 years and younger, commuting costs were more important than heating and cooling costs at 39% and 31% respectively. For buyers 36 years and younger, the expected length of time they plan to remain in the home they purchased was only 10 years, compared to 20 years for buyers 52–61 years.

We consider Steve a friend not just our realtor. He always ask how our boys are doing and asks how Jon's job is going. We don't see each other a lot, but when we do it's like old friends.
Steve would be the first realtor I would recommend to anyone moving to the area. Both our experiences have been stress free and enjoyable.

Steve Duncan helped us sell a house during the downturn in the market which was very challenging. And he exceed all expectations at that time. So when it was time
to purchase a new home Steve was the only one I would trust to handle it for me and
my family. He did a great job in finding us a new home and was very helpful from dealing with my bank all the way to closing. I will always recommend Steve Duncan for any real estate needs.

We worked with Stephen Duncan to sell our property, and were amazed at his unending energy, ideas, and good humor throughout our ups and downs with 4 different contracts. He developed strategies to get the house sold that we agreed with. He guided us through the process, he paid particular attention to all the details and did not let anything fall through the cracks. We felt like we were his only clients throughout this process.

Can't say enough about Steve. He always remains calm, positive, sometimes even humorous, during what is a very stressful time of selling your residence. You always feel he has your back and trust his expertise without question. He has the patience of a saint and keeps you apprised step by step along the way while juggling many other clients. He deserves the entire commission! I've already recommended him to several friends.

Great service, very supportive, helped me purchase and sell the same house
House under contract after two days on the market, got full asking price, Steve made the process easy and less stressful than expected
After hearing the difficulty my neighbors were having selling similar style homes, I was shocked at how quickly my house sold....for full asking price. All home inspection issues were remedied quickly due to Steve's communications, and all the recommendations he made with regards to improvements/maintenance on the house prior to its listing were spot on.

Stephen has been our agent/friend for many years now. We have bought more than one home with his help and understanding of our needs and income. He is the first person I tell friends and family about when they start looking at homes. He is the best in the business!
We were very proud to have him with us at closing.
There needs to be a button for more than Excellent. Stephen had everything lined up. All we had to do is show up and sign papers. The most amazing thing was he got us a price much better than we ever dreamed we would get for our house, We were ready to cave-in and Stephen said" Trust Me" we did and we got a great price for a great house and land! Stephen pointed out all the good and not so good points of the house and told us to think about both before we signed anything.
The whole process from the date we saw the house till the date we closed on the house was less that 8 weeks. The whole process was almost painless. Stephen would tell us what needed to happen next. Make the appointments, we would show up, and we all got it done in record time. He really knows what he is doing.

He knows the process from start to finish, resulting in a smooth and quick transaction. All of this, Stephen G Duncan handles with enthusiasm and a smile on his face. I could not ask for a better experience!

We consider Steve a friend not just our realtor. He always ask how our boys are doing and asks how Jon's job is going. We don't see each other a lot, but when we do it's like old friends.
Steve would be the first realtor I would recommend to anyone moving to the area. Both our experiences have been stress free and enjoyable.

Steve Duncan helped us sell a house during the downturn in the market which was very challenging. And he exceed all expectations at that time. So when it was time
to purchase a new home Steve was the only one I would trust to handle it for me and
my family. He did a great job in finding us a new home and was very helpful from dealing with my bank all the way to closing. I will always recommend Steve Duncan for any real estate needs.

We worked with Stephen Duncan to sell our property, and were amazed at his unending energy, ideas, and good humor throughout our ups and downs with 4 different contracts. He developed strategies to get the house sold that we agreed with. He guided us through the process, he paid particular attention to all the details and did not let anything fall through the cracks. We felt like we were his only clients throughout this process.

Can't say enough about Steve. He always remains calm, positive, sometimes even humorous, during what is a very stressful time of selling your residence. You always feel he has your back and trust his expertise without question. He has the patience of a saint and keeps you apprised step by step along the way while juggling many other clients. He deserves the entire commission! I've already recommended him to several friends.

We worked with Steve Duncan to sell our North Asheville house in 2013, and we didn't even think about contacting anyone else when looking to buy our new home this time. We love him!
As with any house purchase, we encountered a few road bumps, but Steve was great about working hard for us and keeping us in the loop.

I did an extensive search for a Realtor when I found Stephen Duncan. I had certain Realtor designations I wanted the person to have, which Stephen exceeded in and I also wanted a Realtor that had current listings, he had many.
I would highly recommend Stephen! In my opinion,the experience and wisdom he has is much needed in the market today.

Great service, very supportive, helped me purchase and sell the same house
House under contract after two days on the market, got full asking price, Steve made the process easy and less stressful than expected
After hearing the difficulty my neighbors were having selling similar style homes, I was shocked at how quickly my house sold....for full asking price. All home inspection issues were remedied quickly due to Steve's communications, and all the recommendations he made with regards to improvements/maintenance on the house prior to its listing were spot on.

Stephen has been our agent/friend for many years now. We have bought more than one home with his help and understanding of our needs and income. He is the first person I tell friends and family about when they start looking at homes. He is the best in the business!
We were very proud to have him with us at closing.
There needs to be a button for more than Excellent. Stephen had everything lined up. All we had to do is show up and sign papers. The most amazing thing was he got us a price much better than we ever dreamed we would get for our house, We were ready to cave-in and Stephen said" Trust Me" we did and we got a great price for a great house and land! Stephen pointed out all the good and not so good points of the house and told us to think about both before we signed anything.
The whole process from the date we saw the house till the date we closed on the house was less that 8 weeks. The whole process was almost painless. Stephen would tell us what needed to happen next. Make the appointments, we would show up, and we all got it done in record time. He really knows what he is doing.

Property was a difficult sale but Stephen did an excellent job to pull it all together.

I appreciate the service I received from Stephen G. Duncan and Beverly Hanks. Stephen Duncan is very knowledgeable in real estate, and the transactions necessary in purchasing/selling property. Mr Duncan was always available to answer questions, and most of the time with an answer, or able to get one quickly. He knows the process from start to finish, resulting in a smooth and quick transaction. All of this, Stephen G Duncan handles with enthusiasm and a smile on his face. I could not ask for a better experience!
