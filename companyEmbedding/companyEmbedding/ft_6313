Asked by: Ewald

            Thank you for your recent inquiry with The Home Depot. Unfortunately, we do not stock this item in an 8' x 10' size. The largest we carry is 5' x 8'. However, we do offer alternative models that may suit your needs. For any other questions, please call us at HomeDepot.com Customer Service 800-430-3376.

It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

Power Cords from Amazon.comReplacement power cords for home audio equipment can help you get your entertainment center set up and working, even if you’ve lost or damaged the cords that came with your television, receiver, speakers, or media players. You’ll find a variety of power cords, extension cables, surge protectors, and adapters to replace missing parts, or to help set up your home audio equipment more efficiently. At Amazon.com, we offer power cords with a variety of connection types to suit a range of home audio equipment from different brands. You’ll find three pin triangular power cords commonly used in stereo receivers, two prong barrel plugs compatible with disc media players, and a host of proprietary power cords suitable for specific brands and equipment. Since most power cords have detailed descriptions of their dimensions, types, uses, and brands, you’ll be sure to find the right cable for your system. In addition to AC power cords, you’ll find a wide variety of AC/DC adapters, and adapter extenders to help keep your outlets and surge protectors organized. Bulky AC adapters often don’t fit neatly into a single outlet. To help make extra room to power all the components you use, we offer power cords that will extent the length of your AC adapters, so you can plug them into several different spots, and free up space for other cords. To find power cords and extensions that work with your equipment, you can use our handy product filters. Choose the sizes, brands, and connection types you need, and we’ll create a list of products that fit your criteria. You’ll also find a variety of specialty and odd sized power cords for tight spaces and unique equipment. We offer heavy duty power cords for high powered amplifiers, right angle cords for running cabling in constricted spaces, and even flat panel power cords for entertainment centers that are very close to walls.You can organize your entertainment center and get all your home audio components ready to go with a variety of power cords.
