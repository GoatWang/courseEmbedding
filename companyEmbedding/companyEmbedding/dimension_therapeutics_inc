Jun 28 17
Dimension announced said in a federal filing on June 27, 2017, that it expects to reduce its workforce to 56 employees by December 2017. The cuts are part of reorganization at Dimension following its Jan. 31 disclosure of data from a Phase 1/2 study of a hemophilia B treatment. The drug, called DTX101, showed some signs of efficacy but also prompted safety concerns, causing a steep decline in the company's share price. Dimension discontinued development of the drug in May.

				Rare Disease Programs			 
 



 
 






Dimension Therapeutics is a gene therapy company developing novel treatments for rare diseases associated with the liver. Through our partnership with REGENXBIO, Dimension has preferred access to multiple best-in-class adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector systems, which we are utilizing to develop and deliver in vivo gene therapies in multiple rare disease indications.
We are focused on advancing our platform of gene therapy programs in rare diseases through clinical development, and building out a world-class product engine for AAV therapeutics across a wide array of single-gene rare diseases, including ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), citrullinemia type 1, phenylketonuria, and Wilson disease.
Through a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Bayer HealthCare, we are advancing pre-clinical development activities for our program in hemophilia A.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Portfolio of gene therapy treatment
Dimension’s programs address significant unmet medical needs for patients living with hemophilia and rare diseases associated with the liver. The Company’s lead program in OTC deficiency is currently in phase I/II clinical testing. The company is also advancing programs through preclinical testing to address glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), phenylketonuria (PKU), Wilson disease, citrullinemia type 1, and hemophilia A, the latter in collaboration with Bayer.
Dimension’s therapies use the biology of the parvovirus (adeno-associated virus (AAV)) to carry the missing gene in the body to the target cell with the aim of correcting the defect and providing meaningful clinical benefit to the lives of patients. This platform has demonstrated early validation and compelling preclinical in vivo proof of concept across multiple disease states in leading academic research centers. / Learn More /

				Scientific Approach			 
 



 
 






Dimension is advancing therapies based on a next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform that has demonstrated early validation and compelling preclinical in vivo proof of concept across multiple disease states in leading academic research centers. Dimension’s current efforts focus on AAV8 and other forms of AAV that selectively target liver cells, and have been optimized to deliver missing intact genes in diseases associated with the liver. Initial indications of positive net benefit of this approach in patients, demonstration of robust gene expression in multiple preclinical in vivo models and commercially viable novel CMC approaches, provide a strong foundation for Dimension’s proprietary programs.
Engineered AAV Vectors
Dimension’s AAV vector technology consists of two components: the AAV capsid and AAV genome, which includes the human gene we are replacing. The capsid surface structure directs the AAV vector for entry into cells and can be engineered to enhance liver tropism. Within the vector, the non-integrating episomal AAV genome can be engineered to enhance cell-specific expression. Once inside the patient’s cells, the coding region of the AAV genome directs synthesis of the human therapeutic protein that is missing or deficient in patients.
Liver Targeting for Diverse Applications
There are nearly 1,000 liver-associated disorders, a broad number of potential indications from which Dimension can select specific diseases to target for application of its gene therapy platform. Dimension’s liver-targeted AAV platform allows the Company to strategically build the best product portfolio by actively pursuing programs that meet key criteria for advancement, including: 1) transduction and activity levels highly likely to result in clinically relevant efficacy; 2) well-understood disease biology and pathway, and 3) significant therapeutic needs. Multiple programs in hemophilia and inherited metabolic diseases are advancing either in or towards the clinic.

					Full Description



Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on June 20, 2013, is a gene therapy company. The Company is focused on discovering and developing therapeutic products for people living with rare diseases associated with the liver and caused by genetic mutations. The Company has programs for hemophilia B, hemophilia A, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, and glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa). The Company's gene therapy product candidates and programs are designed to provide a functional copy of an abnormal or missing gene using the advanced adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector delivery technology. The Company uses mammalian cells in its manufacturing approach for its AAV-based product candidates. Its AAV manufacturing is performed in over two mammalian cell types, human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293 cells) and HeLa cells.DTX101DTX101 is the Company's lead gene therapy product candidate designed to deliver Factor IX (FIX), gene expression in patients with hemophilia B. The Company's product candidate, DTX101, is an AAVrh10 capsid containing a codon-optimized FIX gene expressing wild-type FIX protein. AAVrh10 is a member of the Clade E family of capsids. The Company initiated Phase I/II open-label clinical trial of DTX101 in adult males with moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B. DTX101 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States.DTX201The Company's product candidate, DTX201, consists of an AAV vector that contains a gene that encodes B domain deleted human Factor VIII (FVIII), which is the commonly used recombinant FVIII protein used in protein replacement therapy. DTX201 is designed to preferentially express FVIII at therapeutic levels for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The Company initiated investigational new drug (IND)-enabling activities.DTX301The Company's product candidate, DTX301, consists of a Clade E AAV8 capsid containing an OTC gene, which is designed to preferentially express human OTC in the liver for the treatment of symptomatic patients with late-onset OTC deficiency. The Company focuses on developing DTX301 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe OTC deficiency. The Company is completing IND-enabling studies of DTX301. DTX301 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and Europe.DTX401DTX401 is the Company's gene therapy program for the treatment of patients with GSDIa, a disease that arises from a defect in glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), an essential enzyme in glycogen and glucose metabolism. The Company focuses its DTX401 clinical development program on adult or young adult patients with uncontrolled or poorly managed disease at risk for acute hypoglycemia.The Company competes with Baxalta Incorporated, Novo Nordisk S/A, uniQure, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Sangamo BioSciences, Inc., Alnylam Incorporated, Freeline Therapeutics Ltd., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Biogen Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Roche Holding AG, Arcturus Therapeutics Inc., Bioblast Pharma Ltd., PhaseRx, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Synlogic, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc., Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., GenSight Biologies SA, NightstaRx Limited, REGENX and bluebird bio, Inc.
