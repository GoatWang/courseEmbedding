These forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those statements regarding our future revenue growth, our expectation that we will have more favourable revenue levels for the balance of 2017 as we deliver on the purchase orders received during the first quarter and book the associated sales.

Enertec being positioned for growth based on its strong reputation and an expected increase in military spending and the timing and expected benefits from our spinoff of the aerospace and defense division including whether such spinoff will be completed.

The forward looking statements contained in this presentation are subject to other risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the risk factor section and elsewhere in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC.

With that, I will now turn the call over to David who will begin the presentation on Slide 4. Please go ahead David.
David Lucatz
Thank you. And good morning, everyone. During the first quarter we experienced continued demand for our products, resulting in awarded contracts for our combined businesses totalling $5.6 million. Revenue [ph] of EBIT line in the first quarter, as compared to same period in 2016.
The decrease in sales and revenue and decrease in Micronet revenue caused by the decrease in supply of Micronet’s new product line, we expect more favourable revenue levels for the balance of 2017 as we deliver on the purchase orders received during the first quarter and book the associated sales. Micronet has a backlog of $7.3 million as of quarter one, and significant increase of 179% in the backlog and $3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Backlog on Micronet grew to $9.3 million by May 15, 2017. We are seeing strong interest in and demand for Micronet product as an ELD mandate requirement deadline nears. We are diversifying our customer base and strengthening our reputation as a provider of reliable rugged solutions.
Enertec is positioned for growth base on its strong reputation and an expected increase in military spending. Our combined backlog remains strong at $15.4 million end of Q1.
On slide 4, we present business order of our TREQ-317 and relatively [ph] large TREQ-r 5. And TREQ-317 is an all-in-one rugged platform. The Android based fixed mount and tablet offer a vast functional at competitor’s choice. During the first quarter we received $800,000 order for the TREQ-317 from a leading American school bus fleet management solutions provider. We also received $2.1 million order from a current customer for the TREQ-317.
TREQr-5 expands market opportunity particularly with a smaller TREQ size customers. We have a strong pipeline which are growing upward with customer evaluating our product in the field.
Following the end of the first quarter on May 1 we received an order worth $1,060,000 million for the TREQr-5 and as of May 15 we have received order for a total of 16,000 units of TREQr-5.
Turning to slide 5. We look at significant order we received in our aerospace and defense business. Our backlog at Enertec on end of Q1 grew by 139% to 7.3 as compared to third quarter of 2106. The Enertec orders announced during the first quarter were missile critical system to be delivered to large multi national defense contractor who are looking to outsource more work to reliable partner like Enertec. Total order received during the first quarter amounted to $2.7 billion.
At slide 6, we highlight the trends of our benefits to our business. The local fleet vertical which represent the majority of mobile resource management or MRM revenue is subject to the ELD mandate and is expected to grow significantly over the next several years. Our unique solutions are compliant and compatible and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this growth [indiscernible] change.

As previously reported, on March 20, 2017, the company’s Board of Directors approved a spinoff of aerospace and defense division of MICT in with Standalone Company. The spinoff will be subject to certain customer conditions, the company Board of Directors still considering whether and when to move forward with spinoff. There is no guarantee that the company would proceed with the benefits [ph] of spinoff or will they be successful in doing so.
I will turn the call to Oren for financial review. Oren?
Oren Harari
Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. The next slide illustrates our revenue breakdown by segment for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the year ago period, as well as on a quarter-to-quarter basis comparisons with Q4 of 2016.
MRM revenues were $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 31% decline from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2017 we saw a 108% increase from $1.3 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.
For the Aerospace and Defense business segment, revenues were unchanged to $2.6 million in both the first quarter of 2016 and ’17. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenues declined by 10% from $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to slide 8, consolidated revenues declined by 90% - 19% to $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. However, on a quarter-over-quarter basis revenues increased by 25% from Q4, 2016.
On a year-over -year basis lower sales were mainly due to a decrease in the supply of Micronet’s new product line. Micronet’s had a backlog of $7.3 million on March 31, 2017 and $9.3 million on May 15, 2017.
Gross profit margins were 13% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 32% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in the overall gross margin was related to an increase in cost associated with the introduction of the new line of products at Micronet and engaging in the strategic contracts with low profitability in Enertec.
R&D expenses came down on a dollar basis and remained relatively consistent on a percentage basis, as compared to the prior year. Selling and general administrative expenses or SG&A increased in the first quarter of 2017 to $2 million or 38% of sales compared to $1.5 million or 23% of sales in the year ago period.
The increase in SG&A is primarily due to an increase in professional expenses related to the previously announced an contemplated spinoff of our Aerospace and Defense division and increases in sales and sale support.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.6 million or a loss of $0.25 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $340,000 or a net loss of $0.06 per basic and diluted share on the first quarter of 2016.
On slide 9 you will see that on a non-GAAP basis not for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.4 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, as compared to 216,000 [ph] or $0.02 per basic and diluted share on a non-GAAP loss in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to slide 10, you can see that our balance sheet remained strong with $7.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, $6.6 million in working capital and $11.4 million in shareholders equity as of March 31, 2017.
I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is by Craig Watts, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Craig Watts
Yes. My question is in relation to the spinoff, I know you said that there is still uncertainties involved with that. I guess, what I am wondering would be, if you have a timeline as to when you think it may occur assuming everything gets approved?
David Lucatz
Hi. We right now - we are working on the form [ph] to be submitted to the SEC. We are working basically own a legal form. I can estimate based on our [indiscernible] that we’re going to have probably take between 3 to 6 months, but it really depends on all the feedback and inputs we’re going to get.

Craig Watts
Okay. That sounds good to me. And I guess my last question would have to do with - you have any projections for the current quarter that we're in right now if we're going to narrow our loss you know substantially I would hope by just $0.25 a share that we lost this quarter it seems a little higher to me and I'm just wondering if we can expect to do better here in this current quarter?
David Lucatz
Right now we don't have sort of information reported because the quarter is not end yet.
Craig Watts
Okay. I know sometimes companies as long as it's a public call like this is would sometimes give projections you know, I don't think it's illegal to do so and that's why I was asking if you were able to elaborate, either share that. What about for the coming quarter. Are we expecting maybe to breakeven during third quarter do you think?
David Lucatz
Again, we – the only thing we can really at this moment say that we have a very strong backlog to be delivered, okay. So this should affect the performance and the result MICTs [ph] shareholders. There is always a question of delegate [ph] but yes, our starting point right now is much stronger than in the past. I think as far as I recall that means [indiscernible] the company.
Craig Watts
Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this point there are no further questions. Before I ask David to make concluding statement, I would like to remind participant the replay of this call will be available within two hours in the US please dial 1888-782-4291, in Israel please dial 03925-5921. Internationally please dial 972-392-55921. David would you like to make concluding statement.
David Lucatz
Thank you. I am very excited about the potential for both our Enertec and Micronet business. In the MRM business the quarter-over- quarter revenue growth numbers combined with the backlog indicates increasing yielded rate in demand we anticipated is indeed unfolding. As Micronet increased its portfolio of industry leading mobile resource management offering, it's extremely well positioned as a trusted leader in that market. In our Aerospace and Defense business increasing [indiscernible] combined with the trend for large multinational defense contractor to outsource Enertec [ph] Looking forward to the balance of 2017, I would like to thank our dedicated team of employees and manager and we look forward to speaking with you in next quarter. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. This concludes the Micronet and Enertec Technologies' first quarter 2017 results conference call. Thank you for participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.

Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results

-- New Full Connectivity Product Line Gaining Marketplace Traction; 4Q Revenues Expected to Increase More Than 60% From Q3




Nov 18, 2015, 7:50am EST














MONTVALE, N.J., Nov. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQCM: MICT), a developer and manufacturer of rugged computers, tablets and computer-based systems for the commercial Mobile Resource Management (MRM) market and for the defense and aerospace markets, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.
David Lucatz, Chief Executive Officer of Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. stated, "During the third quarter we began to see marketplace momentum from our new All-In-One wireless platforms for the MRM sector.  While not reflected in our third quarter results, our new, U.S.-based sales team has generated tremendous interest in our full connectivity product line and we're encouraged by significant increases to our order pipeline.  The growing MRM vertical presents substantial opportunities for our technology as our state-of-the-art solution has the capability to meet the needs of a broad base of MRM customers across diverse applications.  We saw a meaningful increase in our backlog during the quarter which sets us up for a particularly strong fourth quarter and 2016."
Third Quarter 2015 Review

Total revenue decreased to $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2015, as compared to $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. Sequentially, revenues decreased slightly from $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter revenue was impacted by the shift of certain deliveries in our Aerospace & Defense division from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2015.  Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $17 million, as compared to $23.6 million for the same period in 2014. 
Gross profit margin was 20%, as compared to 25% in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in overall gross margin was related to the shift in Aerospace & Defense deliveries, as detailed above.  Gross profit of the MRM division was 27%, as compared to 26% for the same period in 2014. 
Research and development (R&D) expense for the third quarter of 2015 was $485,000, or 8.7% of sales, compared to $546,000, or 4.8% of sales, in the third quarter of 2014.  On a sequential basis, R&D expense decreased 32%, as compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expense was $1.5 million, or 28% of sales, as compared to $2.2 million, or 19% of sales, in the third quarter of 2014.  
Net loss attributed to MICT for the third quarter of 2015 was $1.2 million, or a loss of $0.22 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $0.5 million, or a loss of $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2014. 
The Company reported an operating loss of $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2015, as compared to an operating loss of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
At September 30, 2015, the Company reported cash and marketable securities totaling $10.7 million and working capital of $13.1 million.
Positive Outlook for Q4 and 2016
"MRM backlog grew considerably throughout the third quarter as customers embraced our new product line, and we anticipate 60 plus percent revenue growth over the third quarter and improved gross margin performance in the fourth quarter as orders are shipped.  Furthermore, we have reduced our expenses throughout the year.  R & D expenses declined by 32% sequentially as our All-In-One technology completed its transition to the marketplace, and we have brought SG&A expenses down throughout the year.  Hence, we expect improved financial results in the fourth quarter as we realize sequential revenue growth and control costs. 
"Our order pipeline for the All-In-One solution is strong and we expect to benefit further from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) publication of the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate as the trucking industry prepares for compliance, given that our product captures the required logging data.  With the momentum in our business, favorable macro trends, and focus on driving margin improvement, we anticipate strong revenue growth and net profitability in 2016 and coming years," Mr. Lucatz commented. 
Recent Developments 
Following the close of the quarter, the Company announced that it had been selected by MiX Telematics to provide its fixed, in-cab, TREQ 317 rugged Android tablet for use with the MiX Rovi in-cab display which has been developed to provide a durable, easy-to-use solution for fleet managers to record hours of service and remote tachograph data, and to respond to the upcoming ELD mandate requirements.  
Last week, the Company announced its selection to participate in the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's (TLC) 'Vision Zero' Vehicle Safety Technology Pilot.  Micronet is one of only a few companies taking part in the pilot thus far, which will test and evaluate the efficacy of black boxes, anti-speeding technologies, driver alert systems and related analytic software in promoting safe driving among TLC-regulated vehicles.  
The Company's aerospace and defense business recently received a $1.85 million order from a multinational aerospace contractor for the development and production of a Mobile Command & Control center to be used in rugged terrains for the control and monitoring of advanced weapons systems.  The Company has already seen significant marketplace interest, and given the continued worldwide threat of missile attacks, anticipates that this new product has the potential to become the main growth engine for the division.
"These recent developments demonstrate our positioning in the large and growing local fleet market and the continued international demand for our aerospace and defense products.  We have been strategically focused on diversifying our customer base by growing our presence in the MRM segment and are confident that our U.S. presence and enhanced product offering position us well to drive growth in this market.  Likewise, our missile defense technologies continue to see market demand," Mr. Lucatz concluded.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:

Amortization of acquired intangible assets - We are required to amortize the intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to the acquisition of the Beijer's U.S. vehicle operation and the purchase of controlling shares of Micronet. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization are unique to these transactions. The amortization of acquired intangible assets are non-cash charges. We believe that such charges do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-transaction operating results. 
Amortization of note discount and related expenses - These interest expenses are non-cash and are related to amortization of discount of the UTA Capital LLC, or UTA, notes, the last of which was paid in January 2015. Such expenses do not reflect our on-going operations and all of them were incurred up to the end of fiscal 2014. 
Change in fair value of call options and warrants – The change in fair value of the call options relating to the purchase of controlling shares of Micronet is recorded as interest expense. The change in fair value is derived primarily from Micronet's share price and does not reflect our on-going operations. 
Stock-based compensation is share based awards granted to certain individuals. They are non-cash and affected by our historical stock prices which are irrelevant to forward-looking analyses and are not necessarily linked to our operational performance. 
Expenses related to the purchase of a business - These expenses relate directly to the purchase of the Beijer's U.S. vehicle operation and consist mainly of legal and accounting fees, finder's fees and travel expenses. We believe that these expenses do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude them to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post- vehicle operation purchase operating results.
The following table reconciles, for the periods presented, GAAP net loss attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net income attributable to Micronet Enertec and GAAP loss per diluted share attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net loss per diluted share attributable to Micronet Enertec:

                    Micronet Enertec Acquires Fleet Management Division of Beijer Electronics

                        07 May 2014
                Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQCM: MICT) announced today that its subsidiary, Micronet Ltd., signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Mobile Resource Management/FM business division of U.S.-based Beijer Electronics Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijer Electronics, a Swedish publicly traded corporation headquartered in Stockholm. Closing of the deal is expected by mid-June 2014.

Micronet is purchasing all related intellectual property, product rights, production files, customer base, sales and marketing network, sales leads and initiatives, technical support operation, all related agreements and the necessary inventory. As part of the transaction, MRM/FM division employees will join Micronet to ensure a successful continuous operation and growth of the company.

Beijer's MRM/FM rugged tablets complement and often used to compete with the Micronet product line, offering products with some additional features. The combined company will offer comprehensive product lines targeting different market segments including the largest and fastest growing local fleets, as well as long haul, heavy equipment and workforce field verticals.

Global marketing and sales efforts will be consolidated immediately and accelerated to take advantage of the superior product offerings and the market demand.

David Lucatz, Micronet Enertec CEO, commented: "Experts estimate that the MRM/FM hardware market will exceed $2B during 2014-2016. This strategic acquisition better positions Micronet to gain a significant share of this dynamic growing market. The combined product lines including our recently launched Android-based 317 series and Beijer's products will offer a complete suite of MRM/FM applications."

Mr. Lucatz added: "This acquisition strengthens Micronet's focus on the U.S market, broadens our customer base and expands our operations into new verticals. As the revenues from our major client decline, this acquisition diversifies our client base and creates a healthier and more balanced Company. We're confident that the combination of the companies will ensure our future growth."
