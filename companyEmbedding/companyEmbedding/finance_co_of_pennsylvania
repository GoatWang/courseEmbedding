 Item 6. Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares 
The Company does not sell its shares. The Company does, however, hold itself ready to redeem any of its outstanding shares at net asset value as
determined on the day of final tender of the shares or on the next day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open. Shares of the Company may be redeemed by mail by writing directly to the Company. 
Item 7. Tax Information  The Company has adopted the policy of paying out in dividends each year substantially all of its net investment income. Distributions received from the Company generally will be taxable as ordinary income
or capital gains, unless you are investing through an IRA, 401(k) or other tax advantaged account. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, consistent with existing policy, the Company pays the applicable Federal capital gains tax for shareholders
and retains the net balance for reinvestment, except to the extent that such gains are considered to have been distributed to redeeming shareholders. Each year the Company advises its stockholders of the amount of capital gains taxes paid which is
attributable to them, and they may claim a credit for this amount on their federal income tax returns. 
Item 8. Financial Intermediary Compensation — NOT APPLICABLE 
Item 9. Investment Objectives, Principal Investment Strategies, Related Risks, and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings
 The business purposes of the Company, as set forth in its Articles of Incorporation, are to own, purchase and sell securities of business
enterprises of any nature whatsoever; to own, hold, use, purchase and sell real and personal property of any nature whatsoever as principal and not as agent; and to carry on the business of an open-end
investment company, as defined under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (as in effect on December 29, 1961). The Company’s investment objective in carrying out its business as an investment company is to seek
long-term appreciation of its shareholders’ capital. Further reference is made to Item 16 of Part B of this Registration Statement for a description of its investment policies. 
The Company invests primarily in common stocks and to a lesser extent fixed income securities. It also invests in U.S. Treasury notes and bills and
registered money market funds as a liquidity technique to cover redemptions and as a temporary investment pending a decision to redeploy the proceeds of securities that were sold. The Company may also invest in other registered investment companies
and may write call options on securities it owns.  The authority to make, alter, amend or repeal these objectives is vested in the Board
of Directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to approve such action. Item 16 of Part B identifies the investment policies of the Company which require stockholder approval to change. 
The Board of Directors of the Company oversees the investment of its assets in order to preserve capital and produce income for the stockholders. The
Board utilizes the services of Cooke & Bieler to provide recommendations with respect to the investment of a portion of its equity holdings. Cooke & Bieler does not provide recommendations to the Board with respect to several of the
Company’s holdings, such as PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Coca Cola Co., fixed income securities, the international and small cap mutual funds in which the Company invests and the money market funds, Treasury Notes
and other short term investments used for the Company’s liquidity needs, such as redemptions, dividends and taxes. Cooke & Bieler’s style can be characterized as value oriented, and thus the overall approach of the Company to its
equity portfolio may also be characterized as a value style. The Company has engaged the services of Schroders to provide the day-to-day investment management of the
portion of the Company’s assets devoted to fixed-income investments, which are limited to investment grade fixed-income investments or their unrated equivalents as determined by Schroders. If an investment grade security is subsequently
downgraded to non-investment grade after purchase by the Company, the Company may continue to hold such security in the discretion of Schroders.

Table of Contents
Schroders practices a duration-neutral, relative value fixed income discipline. The term duration
neutral means that the duration of the Company’s fixed-income portfolio managed by Schroders will generally resemble the duration of the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, the benchmark for the Company’s fixed-income portfolio managed by
Schroders (the “benchmark”). Relative value refers to Schroders’ process of identifying the intrinsic value of a security based on certain characteristics (e.g., credit quality premium and structure premium) to determine a target
yield for each security. The target yield is then compared to the yield of a risk-free security (i.e., Treasury Yield) of a similar maturity. Relative value can be assessed versus the risk-free rate and both within and across sectors.
Schroders’ team focuses its efforts on identifying attractive issues from the bottom up, capitalizing on pricing inefficiencies identified through fundamental research. The Schroders team specifically avoids interest rate forecasting and sector
rotation as they believe these techniques add no long-term value and cause unnecessary principal risk. When fully invested, the average effective duration of the Company’s fixed-income portfolio managed by Schroders will normally vary by no
more than one year from the average effective duration of the benchmark.  The Company does not engage in active trading; on the contrary, it
makes a value judgment on the worth of an organization and tends to hold the security for the long term. The Board considers its investment approach to be generally conservative, and thus the risks are those risks generally applicable to the equity
and fixed income markets. It has limited (generally under 15% in the aggregate) exposure to international securities and small cap securities which may involve more risks than the generally broad market. Also, it has had a significant portion of its
assets invested in PNC Bank Corp. and ExxonMobil Corporation, and thus is subject to the risks inherent in investing in banking institutions and oil and gas companies, respectively, and having a significant portion of its assets committed to two
securities.  Risks of Non-Diversification and Focus on Banking and Oil and Gas Companies. The Company
has held shares of PNC Bank Corp. and its predecessors for over 100 years. Its holdings in PNC stock amount to approximately 13.13% of its portfolio and its holdings of ExxonMobil amounted to approximately 14.57% of its portfolio, each as of
March 31, 2016. While the rest of its portfolio is diversified among various sectors, the Company is subject to the risk that the banking industry and financial services sector and oil and gas companies generally will underperform the broader
market, as well as the risk that issuers in those sectors will be impacted by market conditions, legislative or regulatory changes or competition. The Company may also be more susceptible to changes in interest rates and other market and economic
factors that affect financial services firms, including the effect of interest rate changes on the share prices of those financial service firms. In addition, the Company will be subject to the risks applicable to the oil and gas sector. Companies
in the oil and gas sector will be affected by changes in worldwide energy prices and exploration and production spending; adverse effects from changes in exchange rates, government regulation (e.g., higher taxes or other regulatory actions that
increase costs), world events, economic conditions, warmer winters and energy efficiency; market, economic and political risks of the countries where these companies are located or do business; risk for environmental damage claims; and risks related
to terrorism.  Equity Risk. Since it purchases primarily equity securities, the Company is subject to the risk that stock prices will
fall over short or extended periods of time. Historically, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of the Company’s equity securities may fluctuate drastically from
day-to-day. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of securities issued
by such companies may suffer a decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility which is a principal risk of owning shares in the Company.  Fixed Income Risk. The market values of fixed income investments change in response to economic developments, particularly interest rate changes, as well as to perceptions about the creditworthiness of
individual issuers, including governments. During periods of rising interest rates, the values of outstanding fixed income securities generally decrease. Moreover, while securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher yields, the prices of
longer maturity securities are also subject to greater market fluctuations as a result of changes in interest rates. During periods of falling interest rates, certain debt obligations with high interest rates may be prepaid (or “called”)
by the issuer prior to maturity. Current market conditions may pose heightened risks for the Company. While the U.S. is experiencing historically low interest rates, recent changes in government policy, including the Federal Reserve ending its
quantitative easing program and raising the federal funds rate, have increased the risk that interest rates will rise in the near future. A rise in interest rates may, in turn, increase volatility and reduce liquidity in the fixed income markets,
and result in a decline in the value of the fixed income investments held by the Company. In addition, reductions in dealer market-making capacity as a result of structural or regulatory changes could further decrease liquidity and/or increase
volatility in the fixed income markets. As a result of these conditions, the Company’s value may fluctuate and/or the Company may experience increased redemptions from shareholders, which may impact the Company’s liquidity or force the
Company to sell securities into a declining or illiquid market. In addition to these risks, fixed income securities may be subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that an issuer will be unable to make timely payments of either principal or
interest.  International Investment Risk. The Company’s investments in securities of foreign issuers involve certain risks that are
greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions, or changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control
regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges). In certain countries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the United States. The securities of some
foreign companies may be less liquid and, at times, more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. The Company may also experience more rapid or extreme changes in value as compared to a fund that invests solely in securities of U.S.
companies because the securities’ markets of many foreign countries are relatively small, with a limited number of companies representing a small number of industries.  Investment Company Risk. When the Company invests in an investment company, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the
investment company’s expenses. In addition, while the risks of owning shares of an investment company generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying investments of the investment company, the Company may be subject to additional or
different risks than if the Company had invested directly in the underlying investments. For example, the lack of liquidity in an exchange-traded fund could result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities. Closed-end
investment companies issue a fixed number of shares that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter at a premium or a discount to their net asset value. As a result, a closed-end fund’s share price fluctuates based on what another investor
is willing to pay rather than on the market value of the securities in the fund.  Options Risk. The Company utilizes options strategies, and,
therefore, the Company is subject to options risk. An option is a contract between two parties for the purchase and sale of a financial instrument for a specified price at any time during the option period. Unlike a futures contract, an option
grants a right (not an obligation) to buy or sell a financial instrument. For example, an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in exchange for a premium, to assume a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price
during the term of the option. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The securities necessary to satisfy
the exercise of the call option may be unavailable for purchase except at much higher prices. Purchasing securities to satisfy the exercise of the call option can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further, sometimes by a significant
amount, thereby exacerbating the loss. The buyer of a call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the call option. The seller (writer) of a put option that is covered (e.g., the writer has a short position in the underlying
security) assumes the risk of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the sales price (in establishing the short position) of the underlying security plus the premium received and gives up the opportunity for gain on the
underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a put option assumes
the risk of losing his entire premium invested in the put option.  Small- and Mid-Cap Risk. Small- and mid-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established
companies. In particular, small- and mid-cap companies may 
  -4-



Table of Contents

have limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and may depend upon a relatively small management group. The securities of smaller companies are often traded in the over-the-counter market and, even if listed on a national securities exchange, the trading market (i.e., the volume of trades on any given day) for such securities may be less
active than larger companies listed on that exchange. Consequently, the securities of these companies may be less liquid, may have limited market stability, and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than the securities of larger,
more established companies. As a result, the prices of the smaller companies owned by the Company may be volatile.  Value Investing Risk.
Value investing focuses on companies whose stocks appear undervalued in light of factors such as the company’s earnings, book value, revenues or cash flow. If the Company’s investment adviser’s assessment of a company’s value or
prospects for exceeding earnings expectations or market conditions is wrong, the Company could suffer losses or produce poor performance relative to other funds. In addition, “value stocks” can continue to be undervalued by the market for

A discussion regarding the Board of Directors’ consideration with respect to the approval of each
of the Company’s investment advisory agreements is included in the Company’s June 30, 2015 Semi-Annual Shareholder Report, which covers the period January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015. 
U.S. Bank National Association is the Company’s Custodian. U.S. Bank National Association is located at 615 E. Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin
53202. The custodian is responsible for the daily safekeeping of securities and cash held or sold by the Company.  DELOITTE & TOUCHE
LLP acts as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Deloitte & Touche is located at 1700 Market Street, Philadelphia Pennsylvania 19103.  The Company acts as its own transfer agent, dividend paying agent, and registrar.  Total
expenses for the Company during fiscal year 2015 were $932,741 or 1.68% of the Company’s average net assets.  The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 232,000 shares of capital stock, par value $10 each. Each share has equal dividend, distribution and liquidation rights. All dividends and distributions are payable in cash. Each holder of capital stock has one vote
for each share held. Voting rights are cumulative for directors. The registrant met the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code during the last fiscal year and does not anticipate any change in such status. The Company has adopted
the policy of paying out in dividends each year substantially all of its net investment income. Currently, unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Company pays the applicable Federal capital gains tax for shareholders and retains the net
balance for reinvestment, except to the extent that such gains are considered distributed to redeeming shareholders. Shareholder inquiries should be directed to the Company by writing or telephoning the Company at the address or telephone number
indicated on the cover of this registration statement.  Item 11. Shareholder Information 
Shares of the Company may be redeemed by mail by writing directly to the Company. The redemption request must be signed exactly as the shareholder’s
name appears on the form of registration and must include the account number. If shares are owned by more than one person, the redemption request must be signed by all owners exactly as their names appear in the registration. Stock certificates must
be tendered along with the signed redemption request. Shares are generally redeemed in-kind. The Company has adopted a policy of meeting shareholder redemptions in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Board, through the distribution of readily
marketable securities. A shareholder will incur brokerage charges and other costs and may be exposed to market risk in selling the distributed securities. At the discretion of the Board of the Company, shares may be redeemed in whole or in part for
cash.  The net asset value per share of the Company is computed by dividing the total value of the assets of the Company, less its
liabilities, by the total number of outstanding shares. Computations are made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, valuing each listed security at its last sale price on the day on which the determination is made, or if no
price is available, the latest bid price is used. Securities listed on the NASDAQ National Market System are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ official closing price. Securities traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean of the latest available bid and asked prices. Fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services. In determining the value of a
particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such securities, market transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between securities. When valuing fixed income securities that
mature within sixty days, the Company uses amortized cost which approximates fair value. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
  -7-



Table of Contents
Examples of when the Company may fair value a security include: when a security is de-listed or its trading is halted or suspended; when a security’s primary pricing source is unable or unwilling to provide a price; when a security’s primary trading market is closed during regular market
hours; or when a security’s value is materially affected by events occurring after the close of the security’s primary trading market. By fair valuing securities, the Company seeks to establish prices that the Company might expect to
realize upon the current sales of these securities. However, due to the subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing, there can be no assurance that the Company could obtain the fair value assigned to the security upon the sale of such
security.  Frequent Purchases and Redemptions of Company Shares. The Company does not sell its shares and, therefore, the Board of Directors
has not adopted procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of Company shares.  Dividends, Distribution and Tax Information.
Income dividends are normally declared and paid quarterly and, to the extent that a net capital gain distribution is made, it would normally be declared in December each year and paid in the following January for the preceding year. 
Please consult your tax advisor regarding your specific questions about federal, state and local income taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a
regulated investment company and intends to meet the requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) to retain its status as such. The Company intends to distribute substantially all of its net
investment income. The dividends and distributions you receive, whether in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the Company, may be subject to federal, state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. Income distributions
(including net short-term capital gains), other than distributions of qualified dividend income, are generally taxable at ordinary income tax rates. Capital gains distributions, if any, and distributions that are reported by the Company as qualified
dividend income are generally taxable at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, consistent with existing policy, the Company intends to designate its net capital gains as “undistributed
capital gains” which will be subject to tax at corporate rates. The Company’s shareholders will be required to include their share of such undistributed amount into their income for federal income tax purposes as long-term capital gain.
Shareholders will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Company on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds on a properly filed U.S. tax return to the
extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the Company will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains
included in the shareholder’s gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder as described above.  Each sale of Company shares
may be a taxable event. The gain or loss on the sale of Company shares generally will be treated as a short-term capital gain or loss if you held the shares for 12 months or less or a long-term capital gain or loss if you held the shares for
longer.  In addition to the federal income tax described above, U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and
filing jointly) are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on their “net investment income,” including interest, dividends, and capital gains (including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares of the Company).

Item 15. Fund History 
The Company was organized as a corporation by a special act of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved May 12, 1871.
 The Company, until December 29, 1961, carried on its business under a special charter granted by the General Assembly of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved May 12, 1871. Until December 29, 1961, it was engaged in the business of banking; it also held certain investments and parcels of real estate. On December 29, 1961, it filed Articles of Amendment
with the Bureau of Corporations, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, amending its charter to permit it to act as an open-end investment company; and on that date an agreement with the Secretary of Banking of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was entered into under which the Commonwealth recognized that the company was no longer engaged in the banking business.  Item 16. Description of the Fund and Its Investments and Risks   


 
(a)
Classification. The Company is a nondiversified, open-end management investment company. 
 


 
(b)
Investment Strategies and Risks. None except as described in Item 9.   


 
(c)
Policies. In addition to the investment objectives and policies set forth under Item 9 of Part A, the Company has adopted the following policies relating to
the investment of its assets and its activities, which are fundamental policies and may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940.  Fundamental Policies of the Company:   


 
i)
The issuance of senior securities: the Company has not issued any senior securities, and it does not propose to issue any senior securities. 
 


 
ii)
The borrowing of money: the Company has not borrowed money, and it does not propose to borrow money. 
 


 
iii)
The underwriting of securities of other issuers: the Company has not underwritten securities of other issuers, and it does not propose to underwrite securities of other
issuers. 
  -10-



Table of Contents


 
iv)
The concentration of investments in particular industries: The Company will not concentrate its investments in a particular industry, as concentration is defined under
the 1940 Act, the rules or regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute, rules or regulations may be amended or interpreted from time to time, except that the Company may invest without limitation in: (i) securities issued or
guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities; and (ii) tax-exempt obligations of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions. 
 


 
v)
The purchase and sale of real estate or commodities: the Company has neither purchased nor sold commodities, commodity contracts or real estate, nor does it propose to
do so in the future.   


 
vi)
Making loans: The Company does not make loans.   


 
vii)
Other Policies: The Company reserves freedom of action to, and from time to time, may invest in any type of security or property whatever, to the extent permitted by
law. It is the policy of the Company to engage as its principal activity in the business of investing and reinvesting its capital in a widely diversified portfolio of securities with a view to holding those which appear to offer sound possibilities
of current income and future growth of principal. To the extent that the Company presently owns securities of various corporations, it is its policy to retain those investments, adding to them if deemed advisable by the Board of Directors or the
investment adviser, as applicable, so long as they appear to meet the criteria set forth above.  The Company may
write call options on securities it owns, up to 5% of its total assets. A call option on a security gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy, and the writer of the option the obligation to sell, the underlying security at any time during
the option period. The premium paid to the writer is the consideration for undertaking the obligations under the option contract. The initial purchase (sale) of an option contract is an “opening transaction.” In order to close out an
option position, the Company may enter into a “closing transaction,” which is simply the sale (purchase) of an option contract on the same security with 
  -11-



Table of Contents

the same exercise price and expiration date as the option contract originally opened. If the Company is unable to effect a closing transaction with respect to an option it has written, it will
not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expires or the Company delivers the security upon exercise.  The
Company may write covered call options as a means of increasing the yield on its assets and as a means of providing limited protection against decreases in its market value. When the Company sells an option, if the underlying securities do not
increase or decrease to a price level that would make the exercise of the option profitable to the holder thereof, the option generally will expire without being exercised, and the Company will realize as profit the premium received for such option.
When a call option written by the Company is exercised, the Company will be required to sell the underlying securities to the option holder at the strike price, and will not participate in any increase in the price of such securities above the
strike price.  Except as described above as to covered call options, the Company will not write or purchase options, including
puts, calls, straddles, spreads or any combination thereof. Nor will the Company purchase or sell commodities, commodity contracts, oil, gas or mineral exploration or development programs, or real estate (although investments in marketable
securities of companies engaged in such activities are not precluded in this restriction).  The Company may invest in fixed
income securities, preferred stocks and common stocks of other issuers and securities of other investment companies. It reserves the right to invest in such securities in any proportion deemed advisable by its Board of Directors. 
Except as noted above, the Company may invest no more than 25% of its assets in the securities of any one issuer, based on a valuation of
its assets at the time of any investment in such securities.  It is not the policy of the Company to invest in companies for
the purpose of exercising control or management.  The Company reserves the right to invest in securities of other investment
companies if deemed advisable by its Board of Directors or the investment adviser, as applicable, within the limits prescribed by the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
  -12-



Table of Contents


 
(d)
Temporary Defensive Position. The Board has no policy with respect to taking temporary defensive positions that are inconsistent with the Company’s principal
investment strategies as described in Item 9, but the Company may take such temporary defensive positions if deemed advisable by its Board of Directors or its investments advisers. 
 


 
(e)
Portfolio Turnover. The Company has no restrictions upon portfolio turnover of its investments. However, it is not the Company’s policy to engage in portfolio
transactions with the objective of seeking profits from short-term trading. It does reserve the right, if deemed advisable or necessary by its Board of Directors or the investment adviser, as applicable, to sell any asset at any time, regardless of
the holding period.   


 
(f)
Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a policy and procedures that governs the timing and circumstances regarding the
disclosure of Company portfolio holdings information to shareholders and third parties. These policies and procedures are designed to ensure that disclosure of information regarding the Company’s portfolio securities is in the best interests of
Company shareholders, and include procedures to address conflicts between the interests of the Company’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the Company’s investment advisers on the other. 
Pursuant to applicable law, the Company is required to disclose its complete portfolio holdings quarterly, within 60 days of the end
of each fiscal quarter (currently, each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31). The Company discloses a complete schedule of investments in each semi-annual report and annual report to shareholders or, following the
first and third fiscal quarters, in quarterly holdings reports filed with the SEC on Form N-Q. Semi-annual and annual reports are distributed to Company shareholders. Quarterly holdings reports filed with the SEC on Form N-Q are not distributed to
Company shareholders, but are available, free of charge, on the EDGAR database on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
In addition to the above, the Company’s policy is to provide information regarding portfolio holdings, or information derived from
the Company’s portfolio holdings, ONLY to shareholders (or their representatives) and service providers of the Company. This information will be made available to any shareholder (or its representative) upon his or her request to the Company.
Any officer or Director of the Company can authorize the release of the Company’s portfolio holdings information to a shareholder. The portfolio holdings information released to a shareholder will be current as of the most recent date that the
Company calculated its net asset value. The Company does not permit selective disclosure of its portfolio holdings.  The
Company’s policy prohibits the Company and its investment advisers from receiving any compensation or other consideration in connection with the disclosure of information about portfolio securities. 
The Company’s service providers, such as its custodian and investment advisers, may receive portfolio holdings information as
frequently as daily in connection with their services to the Company. In addition to any contractual provisions relating to confidentiality of information that may be included in the service providers’ contracts with the Company, these
arrangements impose obligations on the Company’s service providers that would prohibit them from disclosing or trading on the Company’s non-public information.

Board of Directors  The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Company’s affairs. It retains and reviews its chief executive and chief financial officers who have overall daily responsibility for the
Company’s affairs. The Board also retains the overall investment responsibility for the Company’s equity investments after receiving recommendations from Cooke & Bieler, L.P., an investment adviser to the Company. 
The Board has two standing committees: Executive Committee and Audit Committee. The Executive Committee, composed of Messrs. Mather and Riband,
meets only under unusual circumstances when the full Board cannot meet, and its authority is thereby limited. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Audit Committee was composed of Messrs. Scott, Bedell, Reichner and O’Malley, each
a non-interested director of the Company. This Committee is responsible principally for recommending the Company’s independent accountants, reviewing the adequacy of the Company’s internal accounting controls and reviewing auditing fees.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Executive Committee met once and the Audit Committee met twice. All members of the committees attended each meeting. 
No officer or director of the Company has any employment or ownership relationship with Cooke & Bieler, L.P. or Schroder
Investment Management North America, Inc., the Company’s investment advisers.  The following table sets forth the dollar-value range

For purposes of this Registration Statement, beneficial ownership of shares is defined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and means
generally the power to vote or dispose of the shares, regardless of any economic interest therein.  COMPENSATION. The Company
pays each Director who is not a salaried officer an annual fee and a fee for each meeting of the Board and each meeting of the Executive Committee and Audit Committee actually attended. Aggregate remuneration for all officers and directors as a

rent of $23,374. The Board, with Mr. Mather III abstaining, approved such rental payments as being in the Company’s best interests.  The aggregate compensation paid by the Company to each of its directors and each of the three highest paid executive officers who received more than $60,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015 is set forth in the table below. None of the Company’s directors is a director of any other investment company in a “fund complex” with the Company (that is, an investment company held out to investors as being related to the
Company and that receives investment advisory services from the Company’s investment adviser or any affiliated person of the Company’s investment adviser) and, therefore, the column for compensation paid by the Company and a fund complex
is omitted.

Mr. Mather III receives no compensation for serving as director of the Company. 


2/
Appointed to the Board on June 12, 2015. Elected to the Board by shareholders on April 20, 2016. 
Board Responsibilities. The management and affairs of the Company are overseen by the Directors. The Board has approved contracts
under which certain companies provide essential management services to the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company oversees the investment of its assets in order to preserve and grow capital and produce income for the stockholders. The
Company has engaged Cooke & Bieler to act as a non-discretionary investment adviser with respect to certain of the Company’s equity holdings. In this regard, Cooke & Bieler provides recommendations to the Board with regard to purchase
and sale transactions involving these holdings. However, Cooke & Bieler is not authorized to take any action with respect to these holdings except upon the Board’s instructions and authorization. The Company has engaged the services of
Schroders to provide the day-to-day investment management of most of the Company’s assets devoted to fixed-income investments. The Company has engaged the services
of U.S. Bancorp for the daily safekeeping of securities and cash held or sold by the Company. The Company has engaged the services of Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.
 The day-to-day business of the Company,
including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such as Cooke & Bieler and Schroders (together, the “Advisers”). The Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s service providers
and, thus, have oversight responsibility with respect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk management is the process of identifying and addressing risks, i.e., events or circumstances that could have material adverse
effects on the business, operations, investment performance or reputation of the Company. The Company and its service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various possible risk-related events or circumstances,
to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. The Board has emphasized to the Company’s service providers the importance of maintaining vigorous risk management.
 The Company’s service providers periodically present the Board with information concerning their compliance with the investment
objectives, strategies and limitations of the Company. Additionally, Cooke & Bieler and Schroders each provides the Board with an overview of, among other things, its investment philosophy, brokerage practices and compliance infrastructure.
Thereafter, the Board continues its oversight function as various personnel, including the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, as well as personnel of the Advisers and other service providers such as the Company’s independent accountants,
make periodic reports to the Audit Committee or to the Board with respect to various aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts by management and service providers to manage risks to which the Company may be
exposed.  The Board is responsible for overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Company by the Advisers and
receives information about those services at its regular meetings. In addition, in connection with its consideration of whether to annually renew the Advisory Agreements between the Company and each of the Advisers, the Board annually reviews each
Adviser’s services. Among other things, the Board regularly considers the Advisers’ adherence to the Company’s investment restrictions and compliance with various Company policies and procedures and with applicable securities
regulations. 
  -16-



Table of Contents
The Company’s Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board to review and discuss compliance
issues and the Company’s risk assessments. At least annually, the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a report reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s policies and procedures and those of its
service providers, including the Advisers. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the Company and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the policies and procedures since the
date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and procedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report.  The Board receives reports from the Company’s service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the valuation and liquidity of portfolio securities. Annually, the independent
registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Company’s financial statements, focusing on major areas of risk encountered by the Company and noting any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
Company’s internal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the Board oversees Company management’s implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, which
comprise policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. 
From their review of these reports and discussions with the Advisers, the Chief Compliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and
other service providers, the Board and the Audit Committee learn about the material risks of the Company, thereby facilitating a dialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. 
The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Company can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective
to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Company’s goals, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be
limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Directors as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of the Company’s investment management and business affairs are carried out by
or through the Advisers and the Company’s other service providers each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the
Company’s and each other’s in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board’s ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical
matter, is subject to limitations.  Members of the Board. There are seven members of the Board of Directors, four
of whom are not interested persons of the Company, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (“independent Directors”). Charles E. Mather, III, an interested person of the Company, serves as President of the Company and is Chairman of the
Board. Herbert S. Riband, Jr., an interested person of the Company, serves as the Secretary of the Company and a Director. Charles E. Mather IV, an interested person of the Company, serves as a Director. Messrs. Mather III and Riband are
classified as interested persons of the Company because they are executive officers of the Company. Mr. Mather IV is classified as an interested person of the Company because of his family relationship with Charles E. Mather III. The Company does
not have a single lead independent Director.  The Company has determined its leadership structure is appropriate given the
specific characteristics and circumstances of the Company. The Company made this determination in consideration of, among other things, the fact that the independent Directors constitute a majority (57%) of the Board, that the Audit Committee
of the Board is comprised entirely of independent Directors, that the Company does not sell its shares, and the amount of assets under management in the Company. The Board also believes that its leadership structure facilitates the orderly and
efficient flow of information to the independent Directors from Company management.

Table of Contents
The Board of Directors has two standing committees: the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee. The
Audit Committee is chaired by an independent Director and composed of all of the independent Directors. The Executive Committee, composed of Messrs. Mather III and Riband, meets only under unusual circumstances when the full Board cannot
meet, and its authority is thereby limited.  Individual Director Qualifications 
The Company has concluded that each of the Directors should serve on the Board because of their ability to review and understand information about the
Company provided to them by management, to identify and request other information they may deem relevant to the performance of their duties, to question management and other service providers regarding material factors bearing on the management and
administration of the Company, and to exercise their business judgment in a manner that serves the best interests of the Company’s shareholders. The Company has concluded that each of the Directors should serve as a Director based on their own
experience, qualifications, attributes and skills as described below.  The Company has concluded that Mr. Mather III should
serve as Director because of the experience he has gained as the President and Chief Executive Officer of an insurance brokerage and consulting firm and in his prior role as a director of another registered investment company consisting of 29
portfolios, his knowledge of and experience in the financial services industry, and the experience he has gained serving as a director of the Company since 1981.  The Company has concluded that Mr. Riband should serve as Director because of the experience he gained as an attorney for a large law firm and as a director of a private company, his experience in
and knowledge of the financial services industry, and the experience he has gained serving as a director of the Company since 1994.  The
Company has concluded that Mr. Scott should serve as Director because of the experience he gained as a partner at an investment consulting firm and as a senior vice president at a major banking institution, his experience in and knowledge of
the financial services and banking industries, and the experience he has gained serving as a director of the Company since 1990.  The Company
has concluded that Mr. Bedell should serve as Director because of the experience he gained serving in a variety of executive-level positions for several investment advisory firms, his experience in and knowledge of the financial services
industry, and the experience he has gained serving as a director of the Company since 2004.  The Company has concluded that Mr. Reichner
should serve as Director because of the experience he gained as an attorney for a large law firm, his experience and knowledge of the financial services industry, and the experience he has gained serving as a director on other boards. 
The Company has concluded that Mr. Mather IV should serve as Director because of the experience he gained serving as a senior officer in the equity
capital markets units of two large financial services firms, his prior experience in and knowledge of the financial services industry, and the experience he has gained serving as a director on the boards of private and publicly traded companies.
 In its periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board considers the complementary individual skills and experience of
the individual Directors primarily in the broader context of the Board’s overall composition so that the Board, as a body, possesses the appropriate (and appropriately diverse) skills and experience to oversee the business of the Company.
Moreover, references to the qualifications, attributes and skills of Directors are pursuant to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, do not constitute holding out of the Board or any Director as having any special expertise or
experience, and shall not be deemed to impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof. 
Code of Ethics. The Company and its investment advisers, Cooke & Bieler, L.P., and Schroder Investment Management, North America, Inc., have
adopted Codes of Ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1. The Company’s Code does not prohibit the investment by persons subject to the Code in securities that may be purchased by the Company. However, any
such purchase is subject to preclearance and/ or reporting procedures. The Codes are on file with, and available to the public from, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PROXY VOTING POLICY. The following is the Proxy Voting Policy (the “Policy”) of The Finance
Company of Pennsylvania (the “Company”). The purpose of the Policy is to set forth the process by which the Company will vote proxies related to the assets in its investment portfolio (the “portfolio securities”). The Policy may
be amended only by the Board. The Board shall review the Policy at its discretion, and make any revisions thereto as deemed appropriate. 
Proxy Voting Policy. The Company’s Policy is to vote all proxies for portfolio securities in a manner considered by the Board to be in the best
interest of the Company and its shareholders without regard to any benefit to any other person or entities. In furtherance of this Policy, the Board may delegate the authority and responsibility to vote all proxies related to the Company’s
portfolio securities to one of its members (the “Designee”) subject to the general oversight responsibilities of the entire Board. 
The Policy of the Company is to examine each proxy proposal and vote against the proposal when, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to adversely impact the current or potential market value of the issuer’s securities or the best interests of the Company’s shareholders. The Company determines the best interests of its shareholders in light of the
potential economic return on the Company’s investment.  On occasions when the Board determines that the cost associated with the attempt
to vote a particular proxy outweighs the potential benefits shareholders may derive from voting, including voting foreign proxies, the Board may decide not to attempt to vote such proxy.  Conflicts of Interest. Because the responsibility for voting all proxies related to the Company’s portfolio securities is retained by the Board, the Company does not foresee any instance in which a
proxy proposal would present a material conflict of interest between the Company and/or its Board and the Company’s shareholders. Nevertheless, if a Designee has any relationship with a party making a proposal or there is any other matter known
to such Designee that would reasonably be considered to create the potential for a material conflict of interest between such Designee and the Company’s shareholders, the Designee is required to disclose such fact to the Board. If it is
determined that a Designee has a material conflict of interest with respect to a given proposal, the Board will designate another member of the Board as its Designee for the purpose of voting on such proposal or will vote on such proposal in
accordance with the recommendations provided by an independent unaffiliated proxy firm (e.g., Institutional Shareholder Services). In the unlikely instance that the Board determines that a proxy proposal presents a material conflict of interest
between the Company and its shareholders, the Board will vote such proxies in accordance with the recommendations provided by an independent unaffiliated proxy firm.  Proxy Voting Record. The Company is required to disclose annually the Company’s complete proxy voting record on Form N-PX. The Company’s proxy voting
record for the most recent 12 month period ended June 30th is available upon request by calling
1-215-351-4778 (you
may call collect) or by writing to the Company at The Finance Company of Pennsylvania, 400 Market Street, Suite 425, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106. The Company’s Form N-PX will also be available
on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  Item 18. Control Persons and Principal
Holders of Securities  As of April 25, 2016, the following stockholders were beneficial owners, having voting and investment power, or
sharing voting and investment power, of more than 5% of the capital stock of the Company.

Management Ownership. As of April 25, 2016 the aggregate amount of shares owned by the officers and
directors of the Company is less than 1%.  Item 19. Investment Advisory and
Other Services  Cooke & Bieler, L.P. (“C&B”), which is located at 1700 Market Street, Suite 3222, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, 19103, acts as an investment adviser (without investment discretion) to the Company pursuant to an investment advisory agreement dated April 29, 2005. C&B is retained to furnish reports, statistical and research services, and
advise and make recommendations with respect to a certain portion of the Company’s portfolio of equity securities and investments. However, C&B is not authorized to take any action with respect to these equity securities and investments
except upon the Board’s instructions and authorization. C&B is a Pennsylvania limited partnership. The general partner of C&B is CBGP, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, the managers of which are John P. McNiff, Linda N.
Perna, Mehul Trivedi and Edward O’Connor. Linda N. Perna, Mehul Trivedi and Edward O’Connor are also limited partners of C&B while John P. McNiff is also the general partner of C&B Partner, L.P which is also a limited partner of
C&B.  As compensation for its services, the Company pays C&B an investment advisory fee at an annual rate of fifty basis points
(0.50%) (the “Fee”). The Fee is payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each month. The Fee is determined based upon the value of the equity securities and investments of the Company at the end of the month immediately preceding the
date of payment (the “Portfolio Value”). For purposes of calculating the Fee, Portfolio Value equals the market value of such assets, including cash, which is computed in the same manner as that used to establish the net asset value of the
Company’s shares, except as noted in the following sentence. The following are excluded when calculating Portfolio Value: (a) the value of the holdings of the Company at the applicable dates in PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Exxon
Mobil Corporation, their successors, Coca Cola Company, Dreyfus International Stock I, Oakmark International Fund I, Harbor International Fund, a series of Harbor Fund, Seafarer Overseas Growth and Income Fund, Touchstone Sands Capital Emerging
Markets Fund, and fixed income securities; (b) the value of the holdings of the Company at the applicable dates in such other companies as may be mutually agreed upon by the Company and C&B; and (c) the amount of any accrued liability
for the payment of taxes on the net gains from the sales of the Company’s portfolio securities. The exclusion of the holdings listed above is appropriate as they are all holdings without any regular trading market or without an active regular
market and/or with respect to each of which the officers and directors of the Company have particularly close knowledge or are other investment companies.  The total dollar amount paid by the Company to C&B under the investment advisory agreement for the last three fiscal years (2013, 2014 and 2015) was $119,971, $133,763 and $125,743 respectively.
 Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. (“Schroder”), which is located at 875 Third Avenue, 22nd Floor, New York, NY
10022, acts as an investment adviser to the Company pursuant to an investment advisory agreement dated April 29, 2005. Schroder is retained to provide the Company investment research, advice and supervision and to continuously furnish a fixed
income investment program for the Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities and investments. Schroder is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroder U.S. Holdings Inc. (“Schroder US”), which, in turn, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroder International Holdings (“SIH”). SIH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroder Administration Limited (“SAL”), which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroder Holdings plc.
(“Schroder Holding”). Schroder Holding is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroders plc. (“Schroders plc.”), which is a publicly-owned holding company organized under the laws of England. Almost half of the voting capital of
Schroders plc. is owned by the Schroder family. 
  -20-



Table of Contents
As compensation for its services, the Company pays Schroder an investment advisory fee at an annual rate of
0.30% (30 basis points) of the value of the Company’s assets entrusted to Schroder. Schroder’s investment advisory fee is payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each month. 
The total dollar amount paid by the Company to Schroder under the investment advisory agreement for the last three fiscal years (2013, 2014 and 2015) was
$18,158, $18,933 and $18,649 respectively.  The investment advisory agreements between the Company and C&B and the Company and
Schroder, each dated April 29, 2005, are scheduled to continue in effect for an initial two year term, and may be continued from year to year thereafter if approved by a majority vote of the Directors, including a majority vote of such
Directors who are not interested persons of the Company or, as applicable, C&B or Schroder, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval or as otherwise required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the “1940 Act”). Each agreement can be terminated at any time and without penalty by the investment adviser on at least 30 days’ written notice and by the Company upon a vote of its Board or upon the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities. Each agreement also will terminate automatically upon its assignment, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.  Item 20. Portfolio Managers  This section includes information about the Company’s portfolio managers, including information about other accounts they manage, the dollar range of Company shares they own (if any) and how they are
compensated.  Cooke & Bieler, L.P.  The following information supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the section in the Prospectus discussing the portfolio managers of Cooke & Bieler, L.P. The following portfolio
managers of Cooke & Bieler, L.P. provide advice and recommendations with respect to the Company’s portfolio of equity securities and investments: Messrs. Michael M. Meyer, Edward W. O’Connor, R. James O’Neil, John
Pickering, Mehul Trivedi, Steve Lyons, William Weber and Andrew Armstrong (together, the “Portfolio Managers”).  Other Accounts

 Material Conflicts. The Portfolio Managers face inherent conflicts of interest in their day-to-day management because they manage multiple accounts. For instance, to the extent that the Portfolio Managers manage accounts with different investment strategies, they
may from time to time be inclined to purchase securities, including initial public offerings, for one account but not for another account. Additionally, some of the accounts managed by Portfolio Managers have different fee structures, including
performance fees, which are or have the potential to be higher or lower, in some cases significantly higher or lower, than the fees paid by the Company. This difference in fee structure may provide an incentive to the Portfolio Managers to allocate
more favorable trades to the higher paying accounts.  To minimize the effects of these inherent conflicts of interest, C&B has adopted and
implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the potential conflicts associated with managing portfolios for multiple clients and ensure that all clients are treated
fairly and equitably. Additionally, C&B minimizes inherent conflicts of interest by assigning Portfolio Managers to accounts having similar objectives. Accordingly, security block purchases are allocated to all accounts with similar objectives
in proportionate weightings.

Table of Contents
Compensation. As of the Company’s most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the C&B
Portfolio Managers are compensated using substantially identical compensation structures for all accounts managed. Compensation is divided between base salary, performance-based bonuses and profit distributions from equity ownership. The firm seeks
to balance individual incentives with portfolio and firm-level incentives. C&B measures performance of securities against the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 1000 Value Index for the Large Cap Value strategy accounts. The majority of the team
participates in an annual bonus pool with allocations determined by a peer review process. Allocations vary depending upon individual contributions to the firm’s investment success. Among other considerations C&B measures the four-year
rolling investment results attributed to each team-members’ stock selections. Partners receive distributions based on their percentage ownership and the profitability of the firm.  Beneficial Ownership in the Company. As of the Company’s most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Portfolio Managers did not beneficially own any securities of the Company.
 Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. (“Schroders”)  The following information supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the section in the Prospectus discussing the portfolio managers of Schroders. The following portfolio managers of Schroders
are primarily responsible for making investment decisions for the Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities and investments: Dan Scholl, Susan Beck, Whitney Sweeney, Ryan Haynes and Dennis C. Darling.

 Material Conflicts of Interest. Whenever a portfolio manager of the Company manages other accounts, potential
conflicts of interest exist, including potential conflicts between the investment strategy of the Company and the investment strategy of the other accounts. For example, in certain instances, a portfolio manager may take conflicting positions in a
particular security for different accounts, by selling a security for one account and continuing to hold it for another account. In addition, the fact that other accounts require the portfolio manager to devote less than all of his or her time to
the Company may be seen itself to constitute a conflict with the interest of the Company.  A portfolio manager may also execute transactions
for another fund or account at the direction of such fund or account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the Company. Securities selected for funds or accounts other than the Company may outperform the securities selected for
the Company. Finally, if the portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the Company may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an allocation of
that opportunity across all eligible funds and accounts. Schroders’ policies, however, require that portfolio managers allocate investment opportunities among accounts managed by them in an equitable manner over time. 
  -22-



Table of Contents
The structure of a portfolio manager’s compensation may give rise to potential conflicts of interest. A
portfolio manager’s base pay tends to increase with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets under management, which indirectly links compensation to sales. Also, potential conflicts of interest may arise since
the structure of Schroders’ compensation may vary from account to account.  Schroders has adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a conflict arises.  Compensation. Each portfolio manager is paid in a combination of base salary and annual discretionary bonus, as well as the standard retirement, health and welfare benefits available to all Schroders
employees. Base salary of Schroders employees is determined by reference to the level of responsibility inherent in the role and the experience of the incumbent, and is benchmarked annually against market data to ensure competitive salaries. Each
portfolio manager’s base salary is fixed and is subject to an annual review and will increase if market movements make this necessary or if there has been an increase in his or her responsibilities. 
Schroders’ methodology for measuring and rewarding the contribution made by portfolio managers combines quantitative measures with qualitative
measures. Each portfolio manager is compensated in a combination of base salary and annual bonus, as well as the standard retirement, health and welfare benefits available to all Schroders employees. Base salary of Schroders employees is determined
by reference to the level of responsibility inherent in the role and the experience of the incumbent, is benchmarked annually against market data to ensure competitive salaries, and is paid in cash. The portfolio managers’ base salary is fixed
and is subject to an annual review and will increase if market movements make this necessary or if there has been an increase in responsibilities.  Each portfolio manager’s bonus is based in part on performance. Discretionary bonuses for portfolio managers may be comprised of an agreed contractual floor, a revenue component and/or a
discretionary component. Any discretionary bonus is determined by a number of factors. At a macro level the total amount available to spend is a function of the compensation to revenue ratio achieved by Schroders globally. Schroders then assesses
the performance of the division and of a management team to determine the share of the aggregate bonus pool that is spent in each area. This focus on “team” maintains consistency and minimizes internal competition that may be detrimental
to the interests of Schroders clients. For each team, Schroders assesses the performance of their funds relative to competitors and to relevant benchmarks, which may be internally- and/or externally-based,
over one and/or three year periods, the level of funds under management and the level of performance fees generated. Performance is evaluated for each quarter, year and since inception of the Fund. The portfolio managers’ compensation for other
accounts they manage may be based upon such accounts’ performance.  For those employees receiving significant bonuses, a part may be
deferred in the form of Schroders plc stock. These employees may also receive part of the deferred award in the form of notional cash investments in a range of Schroders funds. These deferrals vest over a period of three years and are designed to
ensure that the interests of the employees are aligned with those of the shareholders of Schroders.  For the purposes of determining the
portfolio managers’ bonuses, the relevant external benchmarks for performance comparison include the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index as well as other relevant fixed income indices determined by client guidelines for Messrs. Scholl,
Haynes and Darling and Mses. Beck and Sweeney as portfolio managers to the Company.  Beneficial Ownership in the Company. As of the
Company’s most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any securities of the Company.

Item 21. Brokerage Allocation and Other Practices
 The Company’s investment advisers are responsible for implementing decisions for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, including
the negotiation of commissions and the allocation of principal business and portfolio brokerage. Purchases and sales of securities on a stock exchange or certain riskless principal transactions placed on NASDAQ are typically effected through brokers
who charge a commission for their services. Purchases and sales of fixed income securities may be transacted with the issuer, the issuer’s underwriter, or a dealer. The Company does not usually pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales
of fixed income securities, although the price of the securities generally includes compensation, in the form of a spread or a mark-up or mark-down, which is not disclosed separately. The prices the Company
pays to underwriters of newly-issued securities usually include a commission paid by the issuer to the underwriter. Transactions placed through dealers who are serving as primary market makers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices.
 During the past year the Company engaged in a number of brokerage transactions in the ordinary course of business with respect to its
investments. Brokerage commissions in connection with the purchase and sale of securities for the Company’s portfolio during the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 amounted to $10,052, $9,808 and $5,798 respectively. 
Although Cooke & Bieler, L.P. may not use commissions paid on Company portfolio transactions to obtain brokerage or research services,
Cooke & Bieler has advised the Company that certain brokers who receive commissions from the Company make statistical and research services available to Cooke & Bieler. Such services consist of items such as basic reports on
specific companies, quarterly updates on specific companies, statistical analyses of a specific industry, reports on the outlook for a particular industry and economic analyses of the domestic and foreign economies. To the extent that they have
value, these services may benefit not only the Company but also Cooke & Bieler and its other clients. However, the expenses of the Company will not necessarily be reduced as a result of the receipt of such services. The Company has been
further advised that it is the policy of Cooke & Bieler to recommend for transactions of the Company those brokers who in its judgment will provide the best price and execution. In reaching its decision, Cooke & Bieler considers
such factors as the rate of commission to be paid by the Company with rates paid by other institutional investors, the price of the security, the size, type and difficulty of the transaction and the brokers’ general execution and operational
facilities.  Item 22. Capital Stock and Other Securities 
The only class of capital stock authorized by the Company is Common Stock.  The following information applies to the common stock:   


 
(1)
Dividend rights: each share has equal dividend rights, such rights to be determined by the Board of Directors.

Item 23. Purchase, Redemption, and Pricing of
Shares  The redemption price for shares upon written request will be the net asset value per share as next computed after receipt of such
request in good order by the Company. Payment for shares redeemed will be made typically within several days after receipt, if in good order, but no later than five working days after the valuation date. 
Shares are generally redeemed in-kind. At the discretion of the Board of the Company, shares may be redeemed in whole or in part for cash. In either
event, the redemption will be a taxable event to a shareholder, and thus could result in a capital gain, capital loss, or, in certain cases, ordinary income to the shareholder. The Company will only distribute readily marketable securities, which
would be valued pursuant to the Company’s valuation procedures. When shares are redeemed in whole or in part in-kind, a shareholder will incur brokerage charges and other costs and may be exposed to market risk in selling the distributed
securities. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the redemption in their particular circumstances.  The Company has adopted a policy of meeting shareholder redemptions in whole or in part through the distribution of readily marketable securities. The Company may follow the practice of distributing
selected appreciated securities to meet redemptions and may, within certain limits, use the selection of securities distributed to meet such redemptions as a tax efficient management tool. By distributing appreciated securities, the Company can
reduce its position in such securities without realizing capital gains. Since the Company does not distribute its shares, the distribution of portfolio securities also enables the Company to avoid the forced sales of securities to raise cash for
meeting redemptions. A redeeming shareholder of the Company who received securities would incur no more or less taxable income than if the redemption had been paid in cash.  The net asset value per share is computed by dividing the total value of the assets of the Company, less its liabilities, by the total number of outstanding shares. Computations are made in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, valuing each listed security at its last sale price on the day on which the determination is made, or if no price is available, the latest bid price is used. Securities traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean of the latest available bid and asked prices. Securities for which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities and
other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. The determination of a security’s fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the
unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may he higher or lower than the security’s value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available. Securities listed on the NASDAQ National Market System are
valued in accordance with the NASDAQ official closing price. Fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information
with respect to transactions in such securities, market transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between securities. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the Company uses amortized cost which
approximates fair value.  Item 24. Taxation of the Fund 
The following is only a summary of certain additional U.S. federal income tax considerations generally affecting the Company and its shareholders that is
intended to supplement the discussion contained in the Company’s prospectus. No attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the Company or its shareholders, and the discussion here and in the Company’s
prospectus is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. In particular, this summary does not address the tax considerations applicable to non-U.S. shareholders. In addition, the Company’s shares held in a tax-qualified retirement
account will generally not be subject to federal taxation on income and capital gains distributions from a Company until a shareholder begins receiving payments from their retirement account. All shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors
with specific reference to their own tax situations, including their state, local, and foreign tax liabilities.  The following general
discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this SAI. New legislation, as well as
administrative changes or court decisions, may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. 
Qualification as a RIC. The Company intends to qualify and will elect (or has elected) to be treated as a “regulated investment company”
(“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Code. By following such a policy, the Company expects to reduce the amount of federal taxes to which it may be subject. The Board reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the Company as a
RIC if it determines such course of action to be beneficial to shareholders. 
  -25-



Table of Contents
In order to be taxable as a RIC, the Company must distribute annually to its shareholders at least 90%
of the Company’s net investment income (generally net investment income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, less operating expenses) and at least 90% of the Company’s net tax exempt interest
income, for each tax year, if any, to its shareholders (“Distribution Requirement”) and also must meet several additional requirements. Among these requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of the Company’s gross income
each taxable year must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, or foreign currencies, and certain other related income, including, generally,
certain gains from options, futures, and forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (the
“Qualifying Income Test”); (ii) at the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company’s taxable year, at least 50% of the market value of its total assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities,
securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Company’s total assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities
of such issuer, including the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership; and (iii) at the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company’s taxable year, not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the
securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer or two or more issuers that the Company controls and which are engaged in the same, or similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of
one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the “Asset Test”).  If the Company fails to satisfy the Qualifying Income Test
or the Asset Test in any taxable year, the Company may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable
requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the asset diversification requirements where the Company corrects the failure within a specified period. If these relief provisions are not available to the
Company for any year in which it fails to qualify as a RIC, all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including capital gains
distributions) generally will be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders, subject to the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and lower tax rates on qualified dividend income for individual shareholders. In
addition, the Company could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest, and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a RIC.  The treatment of capital loss carryovers for the Company is similar to the rules that apply to capital loss carryovers of individuals, which provide that such losses are carried over indefinitely. If the
Company has a “net capital loss” (that is, capital losses in excess of capital gains), for a taxable year beginning after December 22, 2010 (a “Post-2010 Loss”), the excess of the Company’s net short-term capital losses over
its net long-term capital gains is treated as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the Company’s next taxable year, and the excess (if any) of the Company’s net long-term capital losses over its net short-term capital
gains is treated as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the Company’s next taxable year. The Company’s unused capital loss carryforwards that arose in taxable years that began on or before December 22, 2010 (“Pre-2011
Losses”) are available to be applied against future capital gains, if any, realized by the Company prior to the expiration of those carryforwards, generally eight years after the year in which they arose. The Company’s Post-2010 Losses
must be fully utilized before the Company will be permitted to utilize carryforwards of Pre-2011 Losses. In addition, the carryover of capital losses may be limited under the general loss limitation rules if the Company experiences an ownership
change as defined in the Code.  Federal Excise Tax. Notwithstanding the Distribution Requirement described above, which only requires
the Company to distribute at least 90% of its annual investment company taxable income and the excess of its exempt interest income (but does not require any minimum distribution of net capital gain), the Company will be subject to a nondeductible
4% federal excise tax to the extent it fails to distribute, by the end of any calendar year, at least 98% of the Company’s ordinary income for that year and 98.2% of the Company’s capital gain net income (the excess of short- and long-term capital gain over short- and long-term capital loss, less any undistributed capital gains subjected to corporate level rates described below) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of that year, plus certain other amounts. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions to avoid liability for federal excise tax, but can make no assurances that
such tax will be completely eliminated. The Company may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate the Company investments in order to make sufficient distributions to avoid federal excise tax liability at a time when the investment adviser
might not otherwise have chosen to do so, and liquidation of investments in such circumstances may affect the ability of the Company to satisfy the requirement for qualification as a RIC.

Table of Contents
Shareholder Treatment. The Company receives income generally in the form of dividends and interest on
investments. This income, plus net short-term capital gains, if any, less expenses incurred in the operation of the Company, constitutes the Company’s net investment income from which dividends may be paid to you. Any distributions by the
Company from such income will be taxable to you as ordinary income or at the lower capital gains rates that apply to individuals receiving qualified dividend income, whether you take them in cash or in additional shares. Distributions by the Company
of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income. If the Company were to be determined to be a non-publicly offered registered investment company, shareholders may be treated as receiving additional dividends equal to their
share of the Company’s affected expense and as having paid such expenses. The Company’s dividends that are paid to its corporate shareholders and are attributable to qualifying dividends it received from U.S. domestic corporations may be
eligible, in the hands of such shareholders, for the corporate dividends received deduction, subject to certain holding period requirements and debt financing limitations. Generally, and subject to certain limitations (including certain holding
period limitations), a dividend will be treated as a qualifying dividend taxed at a current maximum rate to individuals of 20% if it has been received from a domestic corporation or certain foreign corporations. All dividends (including the deducted
portion) must be included in your alternative minimum taxable income calculation.  A dividend or distribution received shortly after the
purchase of shares of the Company reduces the net asset value of the shares by the amount of the dividend or distribution and, although in effect a return of capital, will be taxable to the shareholder. If the net asset value of shares were reduced
below the shareholder’s cost by dividends or distributions representing gains realized on sales of securities, such dividends or distributions would be a return of investment though taxable to the shareholder in the same manner as other
dividends or distributions.  The Company intends to designate its net capital gains as “undistributed capital gains” which will be
subject to tax at corporate rates. The Company’s shareholders will be required to include their shares of such undistributed amount into their income for federal income tax purposes as long-term capital gain. Shareholders will be entitled to
credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Company on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds on a properly filed U.S. tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such
liabilities. For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the Company will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s
gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder as described above.  If the Company’s distributions exceed its taxable income and
capital gains realized during a taxable year, all or a portion of the distributions made in the same taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to the shareholders. A return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable, but
will reduce each shareholder’s cost basis in the Company and result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. 
If the Company declares a distribution to shareholders of record in October, November or December of one year and pays the distribution by
January 31 of the following year, the Company and its shareholders will be treated as if the Company paid the distribution by December 31 of the first taxable year.  Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange, or redemption of shares of the Company by a shareholder who is not a dealer in securities will generally, for individual shareholders, be treated as a
long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than twelve months and otherwise will be treated as a short-term capital gain or loss. However, if shares on which a shareholder has received a net capital gain distribution are
subsequently sold, exchanged, or redeemed and such shares have been held for six months or less, any loss recognized will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of the net capital gain distribution. In addition, the loss realized on a
sale or other disposition of shares will be disallowed to the extent a shareholder 
  -27-



Table of Contents
repurchases (or enters into a contract to or option to repurchase) shares within a period of 61 days
(beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares). This loss disallowance rule will apply to shares received through the reinvestment of dividends during the 61-day
period.  In addition to the federal income tax described above, U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and
filing jointly) are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on their “net investment income,” including interest, dividends, and capital gains (including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares of the Company).
 Tax-Exempt Shareholders. Under current law, income of a RIC that would be treated as unrelated business taxable income
(“UBTI”) if earned directly by a tax-exempt entity generally will not be attributed as UBTI to a tax-exempt entity that is a shareholder in the RIC. Notwithstanding this “blocking” effect, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize
UBTI by virtue of its investment in the Company if shares in the Company constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Code Section 514(b) or if the Company invests in real estate investment
trusts that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits (“REMICs”) or directly invests in residual interests in REMICs.  Equalization Accounting. The Company may use the so-called “equalization method” of accounting to allocate a portion of its “earnings
and profits,” which generally equals the Company’s undistributed investment company taxable income and net capital gain, with certain adjustments, to redemption proceeds. This method permits the Company to achieve more balanced
distributions for both continuing and redeeming shareholders. Although using this method generally will not affect the Company’s total returns, it may reduce the amount that the Company would otherwise distribute to continuing shareholders by
reducing the effect of redemptions of Company shares on Company distributions to shareholders. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may not have expressly sanctioned the particular equalization method used by a Company, and thus a
Company’s use of this method may be subject to IRS scrutiny.  Backup Withholding. The Company will be required in certain cases to
withhold at applicable withholding rates and remit to the United States Treasury the amount withheld on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Company either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all,
(2) who is subject to backup withholding by the Internal Revenue Service for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) who has failed to certify to the Company that such shareholder is not subject to backup
withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien).  Tax Shelter Reporting
Regulations. Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a
disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current
exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all RICs. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper.
Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. 
Item 25. Underwriters — NOT APPLICABLE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of  The Finance Company of Pennsylvania  We have audited the accompanying statement
of assets and liabilities of The Finance Company of Pennsylvania (the “Company”), including the portfolio of investments, as of December 31, 2015, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the condensed financial information for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and condensed financial information are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and condensed financial information based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and condensed financial information are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements and condensed financial information referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Finance Company of Pennsylvania as of
December 31, 2015, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the condensed financial information for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Deloitte & Touche LLP

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Finance Company of Pennsylvania (the “Company”) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a regulated open-end investment
company. On April 21, 1964, the stockholders approved amendments to the Articles of Incorporation whereby, since that date, the Company has held itself ready to redeem any of its outstanding shares at net asset value. Net asset value for
redemptions is determined at the close of business on the day of formal tender of shares or the next day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open. There were 2,857 and 673 shares of capital stock redeemed during the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively. There were no other capital share transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Company in the preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Portfolio Valuation  Equity securities and exchange traded options that are listed on an exchange are valued at the last quoted sales price. When valuing equity securities that are not listed on an exchange or have not
traded, the Company uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day. Fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use
certain information with respect to transactions in such securities, market transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between securities. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the Company uses
amortized cost which approximates fair value. It is the responsibility of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market quotations are not readily
available or for which the market quotations that are available are considered inapplicable, the Company determines a fair value in good faith in accordance with these procedures.  Federal Income Taxes  No provision has been made for Federal income taxes
other than capital gains tax because the Company has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company meeting certain requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the Company is paying the applicable federal capital
gains tax for share-

holders and retaining the net balance for reinvestment, except to the extent that such gains are considered to have been distributed to redeeming shareholders. 
Distributions to shareholders  Dividends to shareholders from net investment income, if any, are paid quarterly. Distributions of capital gains, if any, are made at least annually, and as required to comply with federal exercise tax
requirements. Distributions to shareholders are determined in accordance with income tax regulations and recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
Equalization  The
Company follows the accounting practices known as “equalization” by which a portion of the costs of redemption of capital shares equivalent to the amount, on a per share basis, of distributable investment income on the date of the
transaction is charged to the undistributed income, so that undistributed income per share is unaffected by Company shares redeemed. Similarly, on redemptions, a pro rata portion of realized capital gains is charged against undistributed realized
gains.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Investing in Government Sponsored Agency Securities 
The Company invests in United States Government sponsored entities. Such sponsored entities, although chartered and sponsored by the
U.S. Congress, are not funded by Congressional appropriations and are neither guaranteed nor insured by the United States Government. 
Security Transactions, Investment Income, and Realized Gain/Loss  Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Dividend income, distributions from other investment companies, and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Expenses are recorded on an accrual basis. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identified cost method for both financial and Federal
income tax purposes.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820-10, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes.
Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value including
such a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
 


 
•
 
 Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
 


 
•
 
 Level 2 — other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates, prepayment speeds,
credit risk, etc.)   


 
•
 
 Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities)

NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OF AFFILIATE  As part of a mutual divestiture of each other’s shares, on August 7, 2015, the Company received a request from the Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Company (“PAWH”) to redeem their
2,087 shares of the Company, which equaled $2,777,906 as of such date. In satisfaction of PAWH’s redemption request, the Company distributed to PAWH (i) all of the shares of PAWH owned by the Company (732 shares), valued at $2,475,573; (ii)
shares of securities held in the Company’s portfolio valued at $302,328; and (iii) cash of $5 (the “Transaction”). As part of the Transaction, the Company’s shares and the securities held in the Company’s portfolio used to
satisfy the PAWH redemption were valued in accordance with the valuation procedures described in Note 1. The Transaction was consistent with the Company’s redemption policies, and the Company has a history of meeting shareholder redemptions
with the distribution of securities held in the Company’s portfolio. In addition, the Company received a legal opinion in connection with the Transaction that stated that the Transaction was not expected to result in a capital gain transaction
to the Company, which results in no distribution of taxable capital gains to the Company’s shareholders. Further, the Company received a “fairness opinion” in connection with the Transaction that concluded that (i) the valuation
methodology employed by the Company was a reasonable way to ascertain the fair value of the Company’s holdings of PAWH’s shares; and (ii) the Transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company and its non-redeeming
shareholders.  The term “affiliate” is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to include among other
things, any company that owns 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another company. The Company owned shares of PAWH since 1917. Prior to the August 7, 2015 divestiture described above, the Company owned 16.94% of PAWH and PAWH owned
4.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company. As a result, the Company was deemed to be an affiliate of PAWH prior to the divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recognized $36,600 of dividend income from its investment in
PAWH.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
In accordance with FASB ASC 815-10, the Company has disclosed information intended to enable
financial statement users to understand how and why the Company uses derivative instruments, how derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815-10 and how derivative instruments affect the Company’s
financial position, results of operations.

Market risks of investing in derivatives 
Derivative instruments are investments whose values are tied to the value of an underlying security or asset, a group of assets, interest
rates, exchange rates, currency or an index. The Company periodically invests in options contracts. Derivatives may have little or no initial cash investment value relative to their market value exposure and therefore can produce significant gains
or losses in excess of their cost. This is sometimes referred to as leverage. Leverage can magnify a portfolio’s gains and losses and therefore increase its volatility. A portfolio’s investments in derivatives may increase, decrease or
change the level or types of exposure to certain risk factors. The market risk exposure from investing in option contracts is price volatility. 
Price volatility risk 
Derivatives tied to equity are exposed to potential price volatility. The prices of equity securities change in response to many factors,
including a company’s historical and prospective earnings, the value of its assets, general economic conditions, interest rates, investor perceptions and market liquidity. Due to the complexities of markets, events in one market or sector may
adversely impact other markets or sectors. Transactions in listed securities are settled/paid for upon delivery with its counterparties. Therefore, the risk of counterparty default for listed securities is considered minimal, as delivery of
securities sold is only made once a portfolio has received payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been delivered by the counterparty. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligations. 
Options Contracts  The
Company may write covered call options as a means of increasing the yield on its assets and as a means of providing limited protection against decreases in its market value. When the Company writes an option, if the underlying security does not
increase or decrease to a price level that would make the exercise of the option profitable to the holder thereof, the option generally will expire without being exercised, and the Company will realize as profit the premium received for such option.
When a call option written by the Company is exercised, the Company will be required to sell the underlying securities to the option holder at the strike price, and will not participate in any increase in the price of such securities above the
strike price. The Company does not write uncovered written options.

The amounts above do not include the fair value and cost of shares distributed in
connection with redemptions. During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company distributed common stock with fair value of $3,819,499 and cost of $81,601. The related gain of $3,737,898 has been disclosed in the Company’s Statement of
Operations.

$1,609,177
  
$21,458,854
 The difference between the book basis and the tax basis of net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) is
attributed primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales.  FASB ASC 740-10
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Management has concluded that as of December 31, 2015, there were no uncertain tax
positions that would require financial statement recognition, de-recognition, or disclosure.

PRINCIPAL RISKS  In the
normal course of business, the Company invests in securities and enters into transactions where risks exist due to fluctuations in the market (market risk) or failure of the issuer of a security to meet all its obligations (issuer credit risk). The
value of securities held by the Company may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the issuers whose securities are owned by the Company; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; local,
regional or global political, social or economic instability, and currency and interest rate and price fluctuations. The extent of the Company’s exposure to market and issuer credit risks with respect to these financial assets is generally
approximated by their value recorded in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

The Company invests a portion of its assets in fixed-income securities. See the
Portfolio of Investments for these securities. Changes in market interest rates or economic conditions may affect the value and/or liquidity of such investments. Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities
will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.  GNMA and U.S. Government Bond invest a significant
portion of its assets in securities backed by commercial or residential mortgage loans or in issuers that hold mortgage and other asset-backed securities. Please see the Portfolio of Investments for these securities. Changes in economic conditions,
including delinquencies and/or defaults on assets underlying these securities, can affect the value, income and/or liquidity of such positions.

entitled to indemnification shall have been adjudged to be liable unless a court determines upon application that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification despite the
adjudication of liability. However, Section 1746 of the PBCL provides that the other sections of the law are not exclusive and that further indemnification may be provided by by-law, agreement or
otherwise except where the act or failure to act giving rise to a claim for indemnification is determined by a court to have constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. The corporation is required to indemnify directors and officers against

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
