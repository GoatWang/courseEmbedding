Real Problems That Will Eventually Need Real Solutions
December 31, 2016
Our country has just endured a presidential election that achieved a new level of hostility and polarization.

About Us


                About L. Roy Papp & Associates, LLC

SEC-Registered  Investment Adviser1: Established in 1978, we provide comprehensive  wealth management services to affluent individuals and families as well as to  institutions from our offices in Phoenix,   Arizona. As of 12/31/2015, assets under management were more than $794 million.


Team of dedicated portfolio managers,  researchers and support staff: We have nine partners and seven portfolio managers, eight of whom hold the Chartered  Financial Analyst® designation and one of whom is a certified public accountant (CPA), supported by our knowledgeable staff. Someone is always  available to assist you during business hours. 
                  Meet our team >


Custom  investment portfolios: We work with you one-on-one to  build a portfolio that is right for you. Your portfolio may be taxable or  tax-exempt (such as an IRA or a SEP) and consist of:             
                       

all stock with an  emphasis on growth, 


all bonds with an  emphasis on income and preservation or 


a mix of both for a  balanced approach appropriate for your needs. 




Tax-efficient: We are always attuned  to tax efficiency for your investments and will work closely with your tax  advisor to fit your specific circumstances. 

Conservative,  stable and consistent

Our  philosophy has remained constant since the firm’s establishment by founder L.  Roy Papp.  We continue the legacy of Roy’s  belief in disciplined investing in long-term growth companies, his integrity  and his commitment to providing high-quality service. Investors look to us to  preserve and grow the value of their assets, enabling them to sufficiently fund  their lifestyles while leaving something for family or charities.                


We  believe that equities provide a greater long-term return than fixed-income  securities do  and that the return on equities will exceed inflation, thus maintaining the  purchasing power of the assets available for investment. At the core of our  investment philosophy is the belief in owning high-quality growth stocks for  the long term, purchasing them when prices are attractive. We believe our  emphasis on quality has enabled clients to participate in up markets while  providing excellent downside protection during periods of market weakness. 


Fixed-income investing is a defensive strategy,  directed  toward production of current income (either taxable or tax-exempt, depending  upon the nature of the account) and protection of the principal from loss.              

Building a  long-term relationship with you; 
                dedicated to your financial well-being and  peace of mind

A  personal portfolio manager: Our relationship begins with the first meeting you have  with your personal portfolio manager. Together, you’ll explore your current  financial situation, investment goals, lifestyle needs and any special wealth  management needs. We understand the full range of financial service  alternatives in the marketplace and will help you create an ideal plan for your  unique circumstances.               


Building  wealth and simplifying your finances: 


You’ll understand what  you are investing in and why it was recommended. 


As a fee-based adviser,  we have no conflicts of interest. We do not receive commissions – just one  simple asset-based fee. 


Situations change, so  we’ll aim to meet with you at least once a year to review your circumstances  and goals. Of course, we welcome the opportunity to meet with you or answer any  questions you have by phone at any time. While you will have a  personal portfolio manager, other team members will know you and your portfolio  in order to be ready to help you as needed.

Real Problems That Will Eventually Need Real Solutions
December 31, 2016
Our country has just endured a  presidential election that achieved a new level of hostility and polarization.  It involved everything from childish name calling  to arguments mainly about irrelevant issues.   Today we would like to focus on four important, long-term problems that  the election debate overlooked.  These  are serious problems that need solutions.   These problems are unlikely to derail our economy or our society in the  short-term, but they will cause serious damage to our country in the long-term  if not addressed.  
The first item that neither  candidate wished to talk about was the deficit and the national debt.  We are currently approaching $20 trillion  dollars of accumulated national debt, two thirds of which was accumulated under  the last two presidents over the previous sixteen years.  It is even more remarkable that we ran up  this debt balance while experiencing record low interest rates.  It now appears that the Federal Reserve will gradually allow  interest rates to rise to their equilibrium level.  As this occurs, the service cost on our $20  trillion dollar mortgage will quickly worsen the deficit.  Donald Trump supporters will argue that  growth will solve the problem.   Directionally, growth will help.   Unfortunately, the deficit is so significant and the debt so large that even  significant economic growth will not solve this problem.  Long-term, our government needs the political  resolve to reduce expenditures and raise more revenue.  The main driver of the deficit growth is  entitlement expenditures, which are exacerbated by our aging population.
The second issue is the growth  rate of health care costs, which have now reached approximately 18% of U.S.  GDP.  There was much discussion, both pro  and con about the Affordable Care Act during the election, but no one seems  willing to address the rapid increase in health care costs.  Again, an aging population that is facing  incredibly expensive health challenges, such as Alzheimer’s care, makes matters  worse.  This is one sector where  technological improvements do not necessarily equate to lower costs, but instead often drives costs even higher.  The Affordable Care Act, with all of its  flaws, was about access, not cost control.   Other nations are also experiencing rapidly increasing costs, albeit  from a lower level.
The third issue is  education.  Progressives want to allocate  more funding for schools while conservatives want charter schools and other  methods to bring competition to education in the hope of lowering costs and  improving outcomes.  In reality, the  solution requires both additional resources and structural reforms.  This problem is particularly acute in Arizona  where funding levels are entirely inadequate and structural reforms have  produced mixed results.  It is hard to  believe that the abundance of knowledge that the U.S. needs to develop may be  produced only by the children of wealthy families who are able to provide their  children access to superior educational opportunities.  All children need to have access to  quality education.
Finally, we wish to touch on  the environment where almost all reasonable people agree that human beings are  having a dramatic impact on the environmental health of our planet.  The political debate on this issue was on how  effective or not various environmental programs have been.  Governments around the world have had a poor  track record of developing cost-effective solutions to this serious  problem.  We believe the solution lies in  technology.  Arizona State University’s  President, Michael Crow, has remarked that while electronic communication and  medical technologies have advanced enormously in the past 50 years, humankind’s  energy strategy, with the exception of nuclear energy and all of its issues,  has not changed that much in the last 150,000 years.  Our strategy is to cut it down and set it on  fire, or dig it or pump it out of the ground and set it on fire.  We can surely do better and eventually we  will have to.  
These are all tough issues and  that is why politicians have avoided dealing with them.  Long-term, our country as well as the rest of  the world, needs to identify and implement successful environmental  strategies.  We are confident that the  United States can lead the world towards solving all of these issues.
Despite tough, long-term  issues, we remain optimistic about our country and our prospects.  Even with all of our problems, we remain the  envy of the world in terms of intellectual freedom, technological development, opportunity  for graduate level education and economic vitality.  People from many areas of the world are eager  to come to the United States because they recognize the opportunities the U.S.  offers.  
As investors we observe that  stocks are hitting record highs, but in our opinion they remain at the upper  end of normal valuation ranges.  We will  continue to experience economic and market cycles and future recessions have  not been eliminated.  At this point, we  do not see significant risks for a near term recession and we believe we are more  likely to see a little faster growth, which should help both corporate earnings  and wages.  If this happens as we expect,  the market can grow into the current high valuation levels and continue to  appreciate.
All of us here at L. Roy Papp  & Associates, LLP wish you and your family a healthy, happy and prosperous  new year.    
Best regards,
