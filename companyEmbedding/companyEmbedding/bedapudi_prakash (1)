Lennox is betting big on India and strategically India is an important market for the company.  Lennox already has an Indian footprint with the new Lennox India Technology centre (LITC) in Chennai. LITC will handle all the global R&D and IT operations for Lennox. Technical talent at LITC has made outstanding contributions to LII’s new product and controls development and information technology platform implementations.  We have invested over US $10 million in R&D operations in India. Our head count will move up to 300.

What is the market size of the refrigeration equipment market in India?
With organized retail evolving in India, there is a good scope for commercial refrigeration. Policies are falling into place for better cold storage facilities for preservation of food and grocery. We expect the market to grow faster in future. The refrigeration equipment market in India is pegged at US $1 billion (around Rs 6,200 crore) and growing at around 20 per cent annually.

The Indian Government expects a US$ 21.9 billion investment in the food-processing infrastructure by 2015 (MOFPI report). Besides, government initiatives such as the creation of mega food parks, subsidies/ duty waivers for development of cold storage chains augurs well for the industry making India’s long-term growth story attractive. LII’s wide range of industry leading refrigeration and HVAC products are well suited for the India market presenting a unique opportunity for growth.
