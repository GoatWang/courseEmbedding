Thomas' is a brand of English muffins and bagels in North America. It is owned by Bimbo Bakeries USA, which also owns Entenmann's, Boboli, Stroehmann, and Arnold bread companies.[citation needed] Advertisements for the muffins place emphasis on their "nooks and crannies." The company also produces toasting/swirl breads, pitas, bagels and wraps.[citation needed]
The company was founded by Samuel Bath Thomas (1855–1919). In 1874, he emigrated from England to New York City and began working in a bakery.[citation needed] By 1880, he had purchased his own bakery at 163 Ninth Avenue, where he featured his namesake muffins.[citation needed] Thomas expanded to 337 West 20th Street where today a plaque designates the building as "The Muffin House."[citation needed] Popular television commercials for the muffins highlight Thomas' immigrant story, often joking about how disappointed Thomas' fans in England supposedly were when he decided to take his muffins to America. (In actuality, the muffins were not invented until Thomas had lived the United States for a number of years.)[citation needed] The company, S.B. Thomas, Inc., was incorporated by his family after his death in 1919.[citation needed]

Thomas - About Us | 

 




135 years ago We started making breakfast



 


 

The story of our quality breadsstarted in 1880 From the original English Muffin to today
Over 135 years ago Samuel Bath Thomas, an innovator and entrepreneur, created the Original “Nooks & Crannies” English Muffin after moving from England to the United States. He used a secret process that included griddle baking to create a muffin that was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. He later opened his own bakery in New York City in 1880. Soon, Thomas’ English Muffins would become a popular part of the American breakfast.
Thanks to Mr. Samuel Thomas, Thomas’ English Muffins is the #1 selling English Muffin and a favorite product in America. Restaurants, award winning chefs and fast food chains have incorporated our English Muffins into their menus. We’re proud of our storied history, but we’re constantly improving to give you the best products to brighten your day. With you in mind, we created Bagel Thins® bagels, flavored bagels, Swirl Breads and more.
 


 




We deliver the high quality products to you
Because you expect the best, hot from the oven, Thomas’ products are still delivered five days a week to ensure our English Muffins and Bagels arrive quickly. 


 


 

Recipe For Greatness Staying true to our methods since day one

We still use quality ingredients to make all of our products.
We have stayed true to our methods.
We listen to our consumers and are actively involved in initiatives to make healthier products.
We encourage environmental processes, such as water recycling, in all of our plants.
 


 




Nooks & Crannies What makes us different
The distinctive taste, texture and flavor of Thomas' English muffins come from the "Nooks & Crannies" way of griddle baking. This process, unchanged since day one, uses quality ingredients to make the distinctively coarse-grained, yeast-raised dough. They are split, not sliced, to keep the unique, toast-up-perfectly texture.

Thomas Jefferson PapersFrom Thomas Jefferson to Samuel F. Bradford, 13 December 1807

Washington Dec. 13. 07.Sir

I see by an advertisement in Poulson’s paper of the 11th. that you have for sale Sharp’s Shakespear in 9.
                            vols 32mo. I will thank you to send it to me, the size being the circumstance which recommends it. altho’ I do not find
                            on your catalogue John Bell’s anatomy of the human body in 2. vols 8vo. yet possibly you may have it, or be able to
                            procure it. if so, I would ask it to be forwarded with the other. if securely wrapped up they will come safely by the
                            mail. be so good as at the same time to note to me the cost which shall be remitted you without delay. Accept my salutations
                            & best wishes.

Th: Jefferson
