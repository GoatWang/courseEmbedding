 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
