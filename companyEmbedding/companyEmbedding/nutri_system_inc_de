(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this Quarterly Report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believe," "estimate," "will be," "will," "would," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "project," "intend," "could," "should," or other similar words or expressions often identify forward-looking statements.  Such statements are based on current expectations only, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include:   competition from other weight management industry participants or the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight management methods;   our ability to continue to develop innovative new programs and enhance our existing programs, or the failure of our programs to continue to appeal to the market;   the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs;   loss, or disruption in the business, of any of our food suppliers;   loss, or disruption in the business, of our fulfillment provider;   disruptions in the shipping of our food products;   claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice and other health or advertising related claims by consumers;   failure to attract or negative publicity with respect to any of our spokespersons or negative publicity with respect to the weight loss industry;   our ability to successfully make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, including our ability to successfully integrate, operate or realize the projected benefits of such businesses;   general business and economic conditions;   the seasonal nature of our business;   loss of any of our third-party retailer agreements and any obligations associated with such loss;   our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights, as well as the impact of our involvement in any claims related to intellectual property rights;   uncertainties regarding the satisfactory operation of our information technology or systems;   risks associated with unauthorized penetration of our information security;   the impact of existing and future laws and regulations;   exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury;   the impact of our debt covenants;   our inability to recruit and retain key executive officers;   potential litigation from our competitors;   provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition or prevent a change in control; and   other risks and uncertainties, including those detailed herein and from time to time in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Our 2016 Annual Report listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected and historic results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers can find  them in Part I, Item 1A, of that filing under the heading "Risk Factors." We incorporate that section of the 2016 Annual Report in this filing and investors should refer to it. Reference is also made to Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Overview  Nutrisystem, Inc. ("Nutrisystem," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily online and over the telephone, multi-day kits and single items available at select retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss. The weight loss programs are designed for women and men. Additionally, our Nutrisystem(R) D(R) program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes, who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes. Our programs are based on over 40 years of nutrition research. Our food is created to be nutritious, delicious and portioned for weight loss and management. Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.  Revenue consists primarily of food sales. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, the direct channel accounted for 91% of revenue compared to 6% for retail and 3% for QVC. In the three months ended March 31, 2016, the direct channel accounted for 91% of revenue compared to 5% for retail and 4% for QVC. We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands as we continue to advertise across various media channels. New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse. We market our weight loss systems through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media. We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, reactivation revenue, total revenue, marketing per new customer and operating margins.  Our ecommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand. We believe this flexibility is especially valuable as it allows us to react to changing market conditions relatively quickly. Additionally, we are continually looking to make investments to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay and overall customer satisfaction. We are able to test new commercials, offers and website configurations to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.  We offer customizable programs. Customers are given a meal plan, access to trackers and tools via NuMi by Nutrisystem (an easy-to-use, interactive and personalized weight loss tracking tool), educational digital content and exercise suggestions. Customers are also encouraged to check in periodically with a counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.  In December 2016, we announced our multi-brand approach with two distinct programs, the clinically-tested Nutrisystem(R) Lean13 and the all new South Beach Diet(R). The Lean13 is designed to deliver weight loss of up to 13 pounds and seven inches in the first month. South Beach Diet(R) launched in January 2017 as a structured meal delivery weight-loss program. The plan features fully prepared, globally inspired meals that are flash-frozen to maintain the quality of taste and nutrition, and delivered right to the customer's doorstep. The South Beach Diet was created by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist from southern Florida. In 2003, he published "The South Beach Diet," which became a bestseller with more than 23 million copies in print and multiple titles appearing on the New York Times bestseller list.  Additionally, our multi-day weight loss kits are available at select retailers. The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point. Also, we continue to offer our Nutrisystem(R) programs at Costco through the use of prepaid gift cards. We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and have multiple kits and single items available for purchase.  We believe these new product and program innovations are resonating well with our customers. We provide an increasingly diverse array of weight loss solutions for our customers through an expanding portfolio of products. Our customers now have greater flexibility in choosing between ready-to-go and frozen options, with no restrictions. We believe this translates into higher customer satisfaction and more profit. We have expanded our television and digital reach to both introduce ourselves to new consumers and build brand awareness and to start testing expansion opportunities. Upsell and a la carte sales, including shakes and additional flexible options have continued to expand as more people are adding them to their orders. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 increased 31% from the comparable period of 2016 to $212.7 million. Our revenue growth was attributable primarily to the direct channel due to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle, the reactivation of former customers and increased sales of our premium products. Reactivation revenue increased due to higher volumes building off of recent increases in new customer counts and a higher reactivation rate. Retail revenue also increased due to the favorable timing of shipments which offset a slight decline in QVC revenue.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our 2016 Annual Report.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting estimates we consider critical include reserves for returns, excess and obsolete inventory and income taxes. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we did not make any material change to our critical accounting policies.  Results of Operations  Revenue and expenses consist of the following components:  Revenue. Revenue consists primarily of food sales. Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns. Revenue from the retail programs is also net of any trade allowances, reclamation reserves or broker commissions. No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.  Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material. Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.  Marketing Expense. Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities. Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms. Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertisements and results in probable future economic benefits. The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received. All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.  General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, call center and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.  Interest (Income) Expense, Net. Interest (income) expense, net consists of interest income earned on cash balances and short term investments net of interest expense and unused line fees on our revolving credit facility.  Income Tax Expense. We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record income taxes based on an effective income tax rate for the year.  Overview of the Direct Channel  In both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the direct channel represented 91% of our revenue. Revenue through the direct channel was $194.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $147.8 million in the same period of 2016. Revenue is generated primarily through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection. The revenue increase in 2017 was attributable primarily to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle, reactivation revenue and increased sales of our premium product. Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness. Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change (in thousands) REVENUE $ 212,677 $ 162,110 $ 50,567 31 % COSTS AND EXPENSES: Cost of revenue 98,230 78,558 19,672 25 % Marketing 81,678 59,354 22,324 38 % General and administrative 19,589 17,562 2,027 12 % Depreciation and amortization 3,777 2,850 927 33 % Total costs and expenses 203,274 158,324 44,950 28 % Operating income 9,403 3,786 5,617 148 % INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, net (24 ) 13 (37 ) (285 )% Income before income tax expense 9,427 3,773 5,654 150 % INCOME TAX EXPENSE 1,943 1,221 722 59 % Net income $ 7,484 $ 2,552 $ 4,932 193 % % of revenue Gross margin 53.8 % 51.5 % Marketing 38.4 % 36.6 % General and administrative 9.2 % 10.8 % Operating income 4.4 % 2.3 %  Revenue. Revenue increased to $212.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $162.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue is attributable primarily to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle ($38.0 million), reactivation revenue ($8.4 million) and increased retail revenue ($4.5 million). QVC revenue decreased slightly. In the first quarter of 2017, the direct channel accounted for 91% of revenue compared to 6% for retail and 3% for QVC. In the first quarter of 2016, the direct channel accounted for 91% of revenue compared to 5% for retail and 4% for QVC.  Costs and Expenses. Cost of revenue increased to $98.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $78.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 53.8% in the first quarter of 2017 from 51.5% for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin was attributable primarily to lower food costs and less promotional costs from retail.  Marketing expense increased to $81.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $59.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 38.4% in the first quarter of 2017 from 36.6% for the first quarter of 2016. Substantially all marketing spending promoted the direct business. The increase in marketing expense was attributable primarily to increased spending for advertising media ($23.9 million) and higher marketing compensation and benefits ($463,000). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in television production ($1.2 million) and other advertising ($398,000). In total, media spending was $77.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $53.2 million in the first quarter of 2016.  General and administrative expense increased to $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. General and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased to 9.2% in the first quarter of 2017 from 10.8% for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in spending was attributable primarily to higher compensation, benefits and commissions ($1.2 million) and higher non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($593,000).  Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to increased capital expenditures for our websites, digital tools and new warehouses.  Interest (Income) Expense, Net. Interest income, net was $24,000 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to interest expense, net of $13,000 in the first quarter of 2016 due to higher interest income offset by a lower amount of amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility.  Income Tax Expense. We recorded income taxes at an estimated effective income tax rate applied to income before income tax expense of 35.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was reduced to 20.6% after recording discrete items, primarily due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," as of January 1, 2017. Income tax expense in the first quarter of 2017 was $1.9 million. We recognized an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $1.4  million within income tax expense rather than as additional paid-in capital under previous accounting guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an income tax expense of $1.2 million, which reflects an effective income tax rate of 32.4%.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  As of March 31, 2017, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under agreements with food suppliers, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, agreements with our internet and networking providers, operating leases and employment contracts. Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Financial Data  At March 31, 2017 we had working capital of $46.8 million as compared to $41.8 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 were $38.0 million, an increase of $28.4 million from the balance of $9.6 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, we had $28.4 million invested in short term investments at March 31, 2017, as compared to $23.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.5 million. Our principal sources of liquidity during this period were cash flows from operations.  On November 6, 2015, we entered into a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a lender. The credit facility provides for interest on borrowings at either a base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin and is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly. The credit facility contains financial and other covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (applicable if there are outstanding borrowings), and limitations on, among other things, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets. The credit facility can be drawn upon through November 6, 2020, at which time all amounts must be repaid. There were no borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.  In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we generated cash flows of $41.0 million from operating activities, an increase of $21.0 million from the same period of 2016. An increase of $4.9 million in net income and $15.0 million of additional cash flow provided by the net change in operating assets and liabilities were the primary drivers of increased cash flow from operations largely due to the increase in demand and marketing for our products as well as the timing of retail shipments.  In the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $7.0 million, an increase of $2.1 million as we invested additional amounts in short term investments.  In the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $5.6 million and included $5.3 million for the payment of dividends, $1.3 million to satisfy the tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of equity awards and $785,000 to repurchase and retire common shares to satisfy employee tax withholdings partially offset by $1.8 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.  On May 3, 2016, we announced our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise over the next 18-month period. The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us at our discretion and will be based on a number of factors including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. No shares were repurchased under this program during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Subsequent to March 31, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on May 18, 2017 to stockholders of record as of May 8, 2017. Although we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by our Board of Directors following its review of our financial performance.  We believe that our available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations and dividends for the foreseeable future.  Seasonality  Typically, in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and weakest in the fourth quarter. We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

FORT WASHINGTON, Pa., April 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Nutrisystem, Inc. (NASDAQ:   NTRI), a leading provider of weight management products and services, announced today a series of product developments and introductions that showcase the Company's commitment to innovation in the weight loss space. Specifically, Nutrisystem is introducing two new offerings to its product line: Kickstart™ by Nutrisystem, a 7-day kit designed to help break through inevitable diet plateaus, and a Men's Protein-Powered 5-Day Weight Loss Kit. In addition, the Company has reformulated its popular breakfast, lunch and dessert bars to be more nutrient rich and remove artificial flavors and sweeteners.
"Longer-term, effective diets can't be about deprivation, so having a range of really good tasting food is important and we put a lot of emphasis on continually innovating on both taste and nutrition," said Dawn Zier, President and CEO of Nutrisystem. "We're constantly studying trends as well as the ratings and re-orders on our existing menu. We're also leaning on our Science Advisory Board and staff nutritionists to ensure that the science of weight loss is front and center in all of our offerings – both through the traditional Nutrisystem® core program and in our retail products."
New Kickstart™ by Nutrisystem   
Nutrisystem introduces a 7-day kit specifically designed to help breakthrough weight loss plateaus by increasing activity and implementing calorie cycling. The kit includes a balanced, targeted meal plan, Craving Crusher™ shakes, dinner recipes and an enhanced My Daily 3® activity plan. 
New Men's Protein-Powered 5-Day Weight Loss Kit  
Nutrisystem is also introducing, at retail, a new Men's Protein-Powered 5-Day Weight Loss Kit. The kit includes five days of protein-powered breakfast shakes, lunches, dinners and desserts designed specifically to help men tackle weight loss by curtailing hunger and fueling lean muscle. 
New Fruit Smoothies   
Just in time for summer, Nutrisystem is also introducing nutritious Fruit Smoothies in four flavors – Tropical Fruit, Blueberry Burst, Strawberry Banana and Peach Mango. Each smoothie counts as a full serving of fruit and is packed with vitamin C, calcium and fiber. The smoothies are also low in fat, sodium and cholesterol. 
Reformulated Breakfast, Lunch and Dessert Bars  
Artificial flavors and sweeteners have been removed from all breakfast, lunch and dessert bars on the Nutrisystem menu. In addition, fiber was increased in each bar.  In the coming months, Nutrisystem will be working to expand these reformulations to its bakery and pastry items with a goal that changes will be complete by June 2014. 
Last week, Nutrisystem announced the soft launch of NuMi, an interactive platform for do-it-yourself dieters as well as dieters transitioning from a structured meal plan or looking for a post-diet weight maintenance program. 
"Our focus is on bringing years of nutritional science and expertise to consumers along all parts of the weight loss journey in innovative ways," noted Zier. "Products like NuMi and our new men's kit are just recent examples of how Nutrisystem is meeting the needs of a wider range of dieters."

                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Nutrisystem, Inc. has received 3.85 out of 5 stars based on 63 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
