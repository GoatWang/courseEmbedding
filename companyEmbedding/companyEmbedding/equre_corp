E-Qure Corp. Key Developments

U.S. FDA Approves Increase in Number of Clinical Sites for E-Qure Corp.'s Pivotal Trial of BST Device for the Treatment of Chronic Wound Care
Feb 23 17
E-Qure Corp. announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct its pivotal trial for the company's patented Bio-electrical Signal Therapy Device ("BST Device") in the treatment of chronic wound care as a staged study, potentially shortening the duration of the trial. The conditional approval that was granted to E-QURE under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) in October 2016 stated the company may conduct the safety stage of the trial in one U.S. institution. The company has since requested an increase in the number of institutions in the safety stage and the FDA responded with an approval, increasing the number of U.S. institutions where the first 10 patients will be treated from one to five. The approval to increase the number of institutions where the first 10 patients can be treated is expected to allow the Company to dramatically shorten the safety portion of the trial, resulting in an accelerated timeline to treat all 90 patients planned for inclusion in the study. E-QURE may request approval to expand enrollment in the study to 90 patients following its submission of an IDE supplement which includes a safety profile of the 10 patients who completed 56 days' treatment with the E-QURE BST device.


E-Qure Corp. Signs a Distribution Agreement with Tech - Médica Equipos Médicos S.A.S. in Colombia for its Patented Bio-Electrical Signal Therapy Device
Jan 18 17
E-Qure Corp. announced that it signed a distribution agreement with Tech - Médica Equipos Médicos S.A.S. in Colombia for the company's patented Bio-electrical Signal Therapy device, a breakthrough novel electrotherapy for the non-invasive treatment of hard-to-heal chronic wounds. This distribution agreement in Colombia is part of E-QURE's worldwide launch of its BST Device, serving the $25 billion global wound care market. E-QURE previously singed distribution agreements in Argentina and Israel, where marketing clearance is expected soon. E-QURE granted TeckMedica the exclusive rights to distribute its BST device and accompanying disposable electrodes for the treatment of chronic wounds. The 5-year agreement includes increasing minimum annual sales quotas. TeckMedica will make an initial advance payment to E-QURE which will be applied against the first year's quota, in addition to placing an initial agreed minimum order upon receiving local marketing approval in Colombia. E-QURE will provide TeckMedica with supplies of the BST Device and disposable electrodes for treatment of patients in hospitals, long-term care facilities, medical centers and out-patient clinics. TeckMedica is responsible for securing any product certification, permit, license or approval that may be required for marketing, sales, sublicensing and treatment in Colombia.


E-Qure Corp. announced delayed 10-Q filing
Nov 14 16
On 11/14/2016, E-Qure Corp. announced that they will be unable to file their next 10-Q by the deadline required by the SEC.

E-QURE's BST Device For Chronic Wound Care Receives Marketing Approval In Israel









PR Newswire




Feb 24, 2017 9:00 AM EST













 


















































  NEW YORK, February 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --    Following    receiving    CE Marking in Europe,     Israel    '   s    AMAR is a major milestone for the country where the device was developed     $   250    M w   ound care    market in     Israel      E-QURE file   s       BST    for inclusion in the National Health Basket   , Israel    '   s national healthcare reimbursement system         E-QURE Corp. (OTCQB: EQUR), a leader in medical devices for the treatment of advanced wound care, announced today it has received marketing approval for the Company's patented Bio-electrical Signal Therapy Device ("BST Device") in Israel from the Israeli Ministry of Health. The Accessories and Medical Devices Registration (AMAR) is granted in order to secure safety and efficacy for medical devices used in Israel. BST is a breakthrough novel electrotherapy for the non-invasive treatment of hard-to-heal chronic wounds. E-QURE intends to immediately begin marketing efforts in Israel by activating its signed distribution agreement with Chemipal Ltd, which was concluded last year and was pending AMAR approval. The Israeli advanced wound care market size is estimated at $250 million, with no electrical device on the market prior to the BST's approval. E-QURE intends to start commercial activity in the private healthcare market, and has filed for including BST treatment in Israel's approved National Health Basket, the national healthcare reimbursement system. " Israel is going to be our commercial pilot sales market. Taking advantage of this small but lucrative wound care market, we intend to build revenues and implement sales techniques that will help us in other markets around the world," stated Ron Weissberg, Chairman of E-QURE Corp.  About E-QURE   E-QURE Corp (OTCQB: EQUR) is a leader in medical devices for the treatment of advanced wound care. E-QURE's breakthrough patented Bioelectrical Signal Therapy (BST) Device is the only method in the world to non-invasively close and heal chronic wounds and ulcers. Current methods of chronic wound treatment at best treat or reduce the wound, but none consistently heal or cure it. The BST Device not only cures wounds, it does so faster, at lower cost, and with more convenience to the patient and the healthcare system. The BST Device has received regulatory approval in Europe and Israel, and is expected to launch in Q1 - Q3 2017 in Israel and Argentina, where approval is pending. E-QURE plans to begin its pivotal U.S. FDA trial in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's pipeline includes additional proprietary wound care products in development.  Safe Harbor Statement  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws. For example, we are using forward-looking statements, when we discuss the potential of E-QURE BST device to treat wounds.  These forward-looking statements and their implications are based on the current expectations of the management of E-QURE only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching and/or successfully completing our clinical trials; our products may not be approved by regulatory agencies; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; results of preclinical studies may not correlate with the results of human clinical trials; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of E-QURE to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by law, E-QURE Corp.  undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting E-QURE, reference is made to E-QURE reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

About E-QURE


E-QURE - Mission
We are committed to advance the science of novel bioelectrical signals, discovered in humans, to innovative electrotherapies that create a new standard of care, restore health or even save lives.
E-QURE - Products & Innovations
E-QURE - first breakthrough medical application, launched in 2007, was the BST - Bioelectrical Signal Therapy™ Device, a pioneering novel electrotherapy for the non-invasive treatment of hard to heal chronic wounds:

Diabetic Foot Ulcers
Pressure (Decubitus) Ulcers
Vascular (Arterial and Venous) Leg Ulcers
Others, which are resistant to standard or more complex treatments

The safety and efficacy of BST were evaluated in a multicentre randomized controlled study on grade III pressure ulcers as published in the Journal of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA 2007 *1. The rapid therapeutic response to the BST was observed on hard–to–heal chronic wounds that had failed to heal after 10 and even 20 years of standard therapy as published in the JWC (Journal of Wound Care) 2010 *2.
The BST has regulatory approvals for the intended use of chronic wounds treatment in Europe (CE), Canada, Brazil and Israel. FDA approval is pending.

The Company will then continue the trial to complete all 90 patients in the trial.E-QURE's Clinical trial is designed to be Double Arm, Controlled, Blinded, Placebo with Sham device, testing the safety and efficacy of the BST Device, by treating 90 patients, half of which with signal and half without. The Company will start the trial with 10 patients within the trial protocol. After completing the trial with the initial ten patients, the Company's report will be filed with the FDA describing all device related adverse events and side effects, if any. Assuming that this report is satisfactory to the FDA, the Company will continue the trial with the additional 80 patients to complete treatment in 90 patients.Ron Weissberg, Chairman of E-QURE Corp., commented.

The safety and efficacy of BST were evaluated in a multicentre randomized controlled study on grade III pressure ulcers as published in the Journal of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA 2007 *1. The rapid therapeutic response to the BST was observed on hard–to–heal chronic wounds that had failed to heal after 10 and even 20 years of standard therapy as published in the JWC (Journal of Wound Care) 2010 *2.
The BST has regulatory approvals for the intended use of chronic wounds treatment in Europe (CE), Canada, Brazil and Israel. FDA approval is pending.
