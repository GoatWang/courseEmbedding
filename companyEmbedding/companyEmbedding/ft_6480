        Pleasantly surprised
I am a woman who owns and operates a sign shop by myself.
I wanted a saw that was safe, easy to use and had decent accuracy. I cut a variety of materials.... wood, plastics, metal composites, foams, etc, and this saw has never let me down. It was easy to assemble and I get within 1/16" of accuracy with this saw until I start cutting pieces smaller than 10" x 10" then it's off a bit more, however, I have never tried to fine tune for better because I usually cut small pieces on my router.
I have owned this saw for a year so far and no issues.
Price was great too. A comparable panel saw brand that is commonly used in the sign industry would have cost me an additional $1000.
Highly recommended..

        Milwaukee panel saw
I purchased the panel saw and was amazed with its accuracy. With a few minor adjustments the saw cut perfectly. All the parts were there and everything went together in a short period of time!
I would reccomend this saw to anyone who has limited space and wants a quality saw! I t is well worth the money spent!

The saw itself is very cool, and is great for our school theatre department. My MS and HS kids use it, and it is more safe to me even than the sawstop we have.  We cut a lot of plywood and Luan, so it made total sense. 

Setup of the actual saw itself was pretty easy. A couple of sections were a little confusing, even to me, but we figured it out. One Con of the saw setup is that at least on ours, the tape measures/guides were off and it took us a while to configure it so that it was right. There was also a minor struggle putting the cord holder in the top bars, you will need a couple of vise grips or large channel locks. 

We got the bottom extension wings, and those were really worth it. We also got the dust collection kit, and wheels, and I would recommend getting these accessories through CPOMilwaukee.com, they were great and by far the most competitive. I only mention this because Home Depot couldn't order any of the accessories, which I found very odd, especially since the Milwaukee corp is only 15 minutes from my store. Oh well :-)

All in all, a great tool, portable, and easy to use once setup right. Hope this helps anyone looking at it. Don't think, just buy it! :-)

        Good saw for the price
I'm a cabinet maker who has worked in shops with 50K panel saws. When I lost my job in Jan, 2008 I started my own shop. Tool cost was an issue. The Milwaukee saw takes some practice to use accurately but sheet goods can be cut a tad over size and cut to size on the table saw for precision. It's half the price of a Safety Speed Cut Saw and a very good value. When my shop is ready, I'll buy a better saw... and keep the Milwaukee to cut P - lam on....

About LabwareLabware includes a variety of products and equipment such as cylinders, lab glassware, and petri dishes for holding liquids and other substances in a laboratory environment. Additional labware items include ampules, beakers, carboys, and various lab bottles and test tubes. When choosing the right piece of labware for a given application, there are some important factors to consider, including material type, durability, and capacity. Labware comes in a variety of material types, such as glass, and plastic. Glass is an inert brittle solid, and is heat and corrosion resistant. Pyrex labware, for example, is selected for its strength and chemical-resistant properties. Borosilicate, a common type of glass used in labware materials, is sometimes manufactured to conform to government specifications. Plastics, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), are typically lighter than glass, and have varying levels of transparency, rigidity and flexibility. Labware comes in a wide array of capacities. A separatory funnel, used to distinguish liquid densities, commonly comes in many different capacities such as 50, 500, and 1000mL. Labware also comes in many shapes. Volumetric flasks, used for mixing, sampling and filling, have many different shapes, heights, and mouth widths, and sometimes have a flat bottom, or come with a stopper or other cap type. A pipet is labware that is used to draw, measure, and transfer liquids. A pipet typically has metric (mL) graduations, and comes in various millimeter (mm) lengths Serological, volumetric (also known as transfer), or measuring (also known as Mohr) are common pipet types. Blow-out pipets are often used in lab applications. Labware is commonly used by researchers, chemists, and biologists in the industrial, chemical, education, research and life sciences industries.
