      Fitch Affirms Three Classes of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A
    





March 14, 2016 05:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms three 
      outstanding classes of the World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A at 
      their current ratings. A full list of rating action follows at the end 
      of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable 
      performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in 
      performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential 
      negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A:--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class 
      B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;

N.A (FICO) score of 727, WA seasoning of 5.7 months, and 94% of the pool is backed by new vehicles. 2014-A is geographically concentrated in the Southeast, consistent with historical World Omni originations.Highest Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms greater than 60 months total 67.6% in 2014-A, the highest ever to date in a WOART pool. Extended-term loans have historically produced higher loss rates and have been specifically accounted for in Fitch's analysis. However, the borrowers within this longer term range have strong obligor FICO scores.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Overall credit enhancement (CE) in 2014-A is consistent with prior transactions, with 4.55% hard CE for the class A notes and 2.50% for the class B notes, and 2.90% of annual excess spread. Under Fitch's analysis, the structure is able to support stressed losses commensurate with the expected ratings.Improving Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and securitization delinquency and loss performance has improved since 2009, driven by the strong credit quality of originations and adequate servicing, support from the improving, albeit slow, U.S. economic recovery, and stable used vehicle values despite moderating over the past year.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer. This is evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This shows a potential downgrade of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report.Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A --Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance Transactions'.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2014-A (US ABS)http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=746335ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSpanish Economy Expands at Fastest Pace in Almost Two YearsBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAnthony Scaramucci's wife reportedly filed for divorce because he was 'hell-bent' on joining TrumpBusiness InsiderMainstream Model 3 holds promise _ and peril _ for TeslaAssociated PressThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredHow Casino Mogul Steve Wynn Lost $10 Million on BaccaratBloombergChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderWhich Travel Card Has the Most Valuable Miles?Wise BreadSponsoredAmazon has made half the profits of Macy’s over the past 20 yearsQuartzMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoNorth Korea says 2nd ICBM test puts 'entire' US in rangeJohn: Doesn't that little fat kid know that if he actually fires a missile at something other than water, his country will just be annihilated?Join the Conversation1 / 55.3k
