As Boston-based online home furnishings retailer Wayfair continues to grow — with sales last year of $1 billion — so too does its technology needs.
And since its start, Wayfair co-founder Steve Conine has been serving as the company's chief technology officer. But now that his engineering team has grown to include 350 engineers — and growing — Conine has decided that it's better to let someone else take charge.

On Friday, Wayfair (NYSE: W) named its new chief technology officer: Jeremy Delinsky, an executive at Watertown-based cloud-based electronic health record software maker athenahealth (Nasdaq: ATHN). Conine will relinquish his role as CTO, but will still oversee the company's technology in a broad sense, according to a Wayfair spokeswoman.




Delinsky will start his job in late June or early July.
During his tenure at athenahealth, Delinsky served as chief technology officer for more than four years and most recently as chief product officer— responsible for the development and commercialization of athenahealth's emerging products. As CTO, Delinsky was responsible for scaling athenahealth’s software development, user experience, product management, and technology infrastructure organizations.
