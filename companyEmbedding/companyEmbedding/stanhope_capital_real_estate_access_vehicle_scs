Pinto: Why Stanhope's co-founders parted ways


By

James Phillipps 


                
                08 Feb, 2017
            











Stanhope Capital chief executive Daniel Pinto became the majority shareholder in the business last month, taking his stake up to 58.5%.He snapped up departing co-founder Julien Sevaux’s 27.5% equity holding for an undisclosed sum. Sevaux has left to launch a new fund management business, but will continue to sit on Stanhope’s investment committee and his family have committed to remain clients.The pair set up Stanhope in 2004 and it has since gathered $9.5 billion (£7.6 billion) of assets under management. But Pinto (pictured), a former Wealth Manager cover star, said the pair felt now was the time to part ways.‘Julien has a project to develop a new fund focused on equity and equity-like investments and Stanhope is entirely independent and does not have in-house products, so he decided to do it outside of Stanhope,’ he said.‘It makes sense he kept some role with us and the investment committee is a good forum and way of maintaining links while giving him the freedom to do his new project.‘It is happening in a good and friendly atmosphere.’Sevaux added: ‘I believe now is a prime moment for me to carve out some time for a new entrepreneurial effort, which will be complementary to Stanhope.’Meanwhile, the firm has promoted senior director Charles Franklin to partner within its charities team and Pinto said the company will also shortly be announcing a ‘high profile’ addition to its advisory board to help spearhead its push in Latin America. The board, which is chaired by former BP chairman Lord Browne, also includes WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, Christie’s Americas chairman emeritus Stephen Lash and M. Shafik Gabr, chairman and managing director of the Artoc Group.‘We have the commitment of a high profile individual in Latin America to join in March,’ Pinto said. ‘Now we will have a base to expand into other regions, and by not necessarily having a presence there.’He said the family office is seeing strong client demand in India, but has no imminent plans to open a branch there.Elsewhere, Pinto said Stanhope raised $150 million for new feeder funds to access vehicles across three asset classes – private equity, real estate and private finance.‘The minimum requirement for the best funds is often $10 million and by pooling client assets we can provide access. It’s an important development for us and something we will continue to pursue,’ he said.

 Social Media  Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google + Pinterest Vimeo Rss             Primary tabsSecondary tabs Alternative Investment Funds 

By the term "alternative funds" is meant all investment funds that are not already covered by the European Directive on Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). This includes hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, venture capital and private equity funds and real estate funds. Such alternative investment funds (AIFs) are for “well-informed” investors (institutional, professional, and qualified investors).As one of the first European countries, the Luxembourg Parliament adopted the law transposing the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) into Luxembourg law on 10 July 2013. The law relating to investment managers of alternative investment funds was published in the Memorial A N° 119 on 15 July 2013. This presented an opportunity for Luxembourg to create a brand in the alternative investment market, similar to the global brand it previously created with UCITS. The AIFMD introduced a European passport for alternative investment fund managers who wish to access the entire European market. Through the AIFMD, the European Union created the first regulated environment for alternative investment funds worldwide.Moreover, the European Union acknowledged the need to overcome the existence of multiple fragmented national regimes by introducing a separate marketing passport regime under the Regulation on European venture capital funds (EuVECA) and the Regulation on European social entrepreneurship funds (EuSEF) respectively.Type of fundsThe four main professional investment-structuring solutions in Luxembourg are:The SIF, which provides an operationally flexible and fiscally efficient multi-purpose vehicle that can be used for all asset classes,The SICAR, which is specifically designed for private equity investment and venture capital,The UCI Part II, a flexible but more regulated pooled vehicle,The RAIF, a non-regulated fund with quick time to market due to no regulatory approval necessary.The SIF, SICAR and the UCI Part II are lightly regulated investment vehicles subject to approval and on-going supervision by the CSSF. The RAIF offers many of the same features as the SIF and the SICAR, but removes the double layer of regulation: only the manager is regulated - the fund itself is not. From a legal perspective, AIFs may take the legal form of:a public limited company (SA),a private limited company (S.à r.l.),a partnership limited by shares (SCA),a limited partnership (SCS),a special limited partnership (SCSp),a common investment fund (FCP).Type of assetsNeither SIFs nor SICARs are required to comply with detailed asset limitations, investment restrictions or leverage rules. Nevertheless, a SIF must adhere to the principle of risk diversification, however, the CSSF may allow derogations on the basis of appropriate justification.By contrast, a SICAR may concentrate its holdings into one project, the only requirement being to invest in risk capital.The most recent addition to the Luxembourg fund toolbox is the RAIF, which is not subject to any regulatory approval by the CSSF, permitting a significantly enhanced time-to-market for new fund launches, a feat especially appreciated by private equity and venture capital fund initiators.The UCI Part II exists for promoters of funds that do not meet all the criteria for a UCITS but which are substantially regulated and therefore also accessible to retail investors in Luxembourg.All these vehicles can be structured either as a "stand alone" fund with a single portfolio investment, or as a multiple compartment fund, which, within a single legal entity, creates separate sub-funds (compartments) with different investment policies.Each legal entity and each fund compartment can issue an unlimited number of share classes based on the needs of the specific clients to whom the shares must be sold.A Luxembourg fund which qualifies as AIF under the AIFM law and is managed by an AIFM based in the EU is eligible for a "passport" for sale in Europe.

For nearly a decade, the American economy has benefitted from extremely low interest rates. The Federal Reserve has now pushed rates up three times since December 2015, however, and it intends to raise short-term rates to 3% by the end of 2019.
