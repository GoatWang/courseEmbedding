Dolby Laboratories Names Bob Borchers as Chief Marketing Officer
Jan 7, 2014


Marketing veteran joins Dolby after two decades of innovating at

      Apple, Nike, and Nokia

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: DLB) today announced the appointment of

      Bob Borchers, a marketing veteran with more than 20 years of experience

      at companies including Apple, Nokia, and Nike, as the company's Chief

      Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President, reporting to President and

      CEO Kevin Yeaman.

    


      "Bob comes to Dolby a rich background of bringing compelling products

      and services to consumers in new and innovative ways," said Dolby CEO

      Kevin Yeaman. "I am confident that Bob's leadership and passion for

      bringing transformational experiences to market will accelerate our

      progress as we create and deliver amazing new experiences in Dolby."

    


      "Dolby is a company with a long and rich history in audio

      innovation—especially for those of us who remember the magic of the

      Dolby button and how it transformed the quality of music emanating from

      the cassette players of our childhood," said Borchers. "Today, the Dolby

      brand delivers audio and video innovations and experiences at the

      cinema, in the living room, in mobile media, and even at work. This is

      the opportunity any marketer would relish: a respected brand with an

      incredible pipeline of products and technology ready to bring to market."

    


      As part of the original iPhone® team at Apple, Borchers was

      instrumental in the development, launch, and global expansion of the

      iPhone, iOS, and App Store™. While at Apple, he also led the Nike®

      + iPod® partnership, expanded the iPod accessory ecosystem,

      and forged relationships with the major auto companies to provide iPod

      integration.

    


      Most recently, Borchers was a General Partner at Opus Capital, making

      early stage investments in mobile software and service platforms. Prior

      to Apple, Borchers spent six years at Nokia, where he cofounded and

      served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing for the Vertu business

      unit. Before his career in the mobile industry, Bob worked for Nike in

      Beaverton, Oregon, where he led efforts in product and service

      personalization.

    


      Borchers holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from

Former iPhone engineer Bob Borchers recounts time at Apple


updated 02:30 am EST, Thu February 2, 2012
         by MacNN Staff


 


 Talk to students emphasizes innovation










 



			        
			  				Former iPhone product marketing engineer Bob Borchers, best known for his appearances some of the iLife and iPhone "guided tour" videos, recently gave a talk to students at a California school that touched on his time at Apple, particularly covering the introduction of the iPhone, and what he is doing now having left the company. His talk, captured in two YouTube videos by an audience member, focused on how Apple innovates in hopes of fostering creative thinking in his young audience.The iPhone, Borchers said, was the product of Steve Jobs telling the engineering teams simply that they had to create "the first phone people would fall in love with." The product had to be a revolutionary mobile phone, the best iPod thus far, and let users carry "the internet in their pocket," the latter being a particularly unusual idea at the time, he said. Later in the talk, he described the role of the product marketing team as being akin to "conductors of an orchestra," helping decide what should be in (or left out) of the iPhone and coordinating the many differently-talented teams to get the goals accomplished.

Borchers reiterated the key concepts that Apple has so successfully used to foster innovation to the students: do a few things exceptionally well, break the rules, pay attention to details and make people think "differently" about their relationship with the device, particularly if it was a device that already existed on the market (such as MP3 players or tablets). Borchers pointed out that many of the things people love about the iPhone today -- in particular the apps, but also the video and photography capabilities, the GPS and now the voice interaction -- were not part of the original mandate. In creating a product that revolutionized the industry (and broke many rules, Borchers emphasized, particularly in how phones were sold), they had naturally created a platform that could continue to surprise and delight customers.

He particularly dwelt on Apple's famous attention to detail, partially recounting a recently-circulated story about how the original iPhone was intended to have a plastic touchscreen to protect the LCD. Late in the production process and shortly before its debut, Jobs showed the engineers that the plastic, while protective, would scratch when people kept it in their pocket with keys and other items, forcing the team to scramble and convince Corning to start up production on its then-abandoned Gorilla Glass, which ended up being a better option for both companies.

Borchers mentioned the company's well-known obsession with product packaging, saying that Apple spends "way too much time on" its product presentation but that it effectively communicates to consumers that the product inside is special, that it is something Apple is proud of and that it is valuable. He showed a couple of early iPhone ads, pointing out that the time in them is always set for 9:42 a.m., the moment the iPhone was originally launched. In another commercial for the original iPhone, Borchers pointed out that the phone number used to demonstrate the Google Map function was genuine and the actual number of the restaurant mentioned ("any other company ... would have used a fictitious number" he added), and that the last time he was at Pacific Catch in San Francisco, they "still had the iPhone special, which is calamari."

Since leaving Apple after the launch of the iPhone 4, Borchers has become a venture capitalist with Opus Capital, saying that Apple and the iPhone had gotten "so big" and that his passion was more for helping others get their own products off the ground, so he left to "get small again." The YouTube videos are posted below.

Cirrus creates Lightning-headphone dev kit
Apple supplier Cirrus Logic has introduced a MFi-compliant new development kit for companies interested in using Cirrus' chips to create Lightning-based headphones, which -- regardless of whether rumors about Apple dropping the analog headphone jack in its iPhone this fall -- can offer advantages to music-loving iOS device users. The kit mentions some of the advantages of an all-digital headset or headphone connector, including higher-bitrate support, a more customizable experience, and support for power and data transfer into headphone hardware. Several companies already make Lightning headphones, and Apple has supported the concept since June 2014. http://bit.ly/29giiZj

Apple employees testing wheelchair features
New features included in the forthcoming watchOS 3 are being tested by Apple retail store employees, including a new activity-tracking feature that has been designed with wheelchair users in mind. The move is slightly unusual in that, while retail employees have previously been used to test pre-release versions of OS X and iOS, this marks the first time they've been included in the otherwise developer-only watchOS betas. The company is said to have gone to great lengths to modify the activity tracker for wheelchair users, including changing the "time to stand" notification to "time to roll" and including two wheelchair-centric workout apps. http://bit.ly/2955JDa

Former iPhone Senior Director: Original iPhone “was not a great phone”


 







		By 		

Evan Kypreos


February 26, 2014



























Bob Borchers, ex-Apple Senior Director of Product Marketing for the original iPhone, has apologised to owners of the device at MWC 2014.Launched in 2007, the original is iPhone definitey a far cry from the current iPhone 5S, but Borchers has gone so far as saying the device was only “okay”.
“If you had the original iPhone I apologise; it was not a great phone, it was an OK phone“, said Borchers while speaking at a Dolby presentation regarding the future of mobile entertainment.  

The tongue-in-cheek comment came after Borchers, now Dolby’s Chief Marketing Officer, explained how Apple changed the smartphone landscape with the launch of the original iPhone seven years ago. 
“What was interesting at Apple is that technology took a back seat to user interface. If you look at the iPhone as a technological element everything had been done before, it was about bringing all that together into an experience that was compelling and then communicating it as an experience not as a technology”. 
MPU 1 (Desktop / Tablet)

He also claimed that Apple actually made mistakes while putting together the customer proposition and marketing the original iPhone.  
“There were three value propositions in order of importance: a revolutionary phone, the best iPod ever and the Internet in your pocket but in fact it should have been the reverse. Having the Internet in your pocket was the most important.” 
He continued by recognising the impact the app community had to the success of the iPhone. 

“It was a great iPod but it was the connection to the internet and the app community that made the difference.”
The focus on the customer’s experience, as opposed to the features or list of techy buzz terms, is one of the key reasons Borchers believes the iPhone was a success – leading to hundreds of millions of units sold worldwide of the course of its seven year history. 


That focus of providing the best possible user experience regardless of device is an ethos that he is intent on bringing across platforms – particularly in the mobile and tablet space, where so much media is now consumed but which he feels currently are currently suboptimal.
“Our goal as technologists and content creators is to present an uncompromised experience so the goal for us at Dolby is to understand how the brain processes audio and video and to present that to the human in the best way possible and to give them the depth of experience in whatever environment they’re in.” he concluded. 

Dolby also announced deeper collaborations with Chinese giants ZTE and Huawei.

Update: Apple had these videos taken offline.  We will make an effort to see if they exist somewhere else. Help us out in the comments if you find them.
Former Apple marketing executive Bob Borchers, who was part of the original iPhone team and helped lead the Nike+iPod partnership and third-party iPod integration with car manufacturers, recently gave a talk at a school in California to discuss his experiences at Apple (part 2 below). In case you are unfamiliar, you might remember Borchers from several “guided tour” videos for iPhone and other Apple products a few years back. He has also been a source for many of the interesting stories coming from Adam Lashinsky’s new book “Inside Apple.”
At the starting of his talk to students, Borchers surveys the crowd to find out the ratio of Android users to iPhone users, leading him to joke: “Alright that’s good. I’ll keep my Apple stock.” As a former marketing executive, Borchers showed and talked about a few ads, but also discussed the AT&T partnership, as he noted, “We broke rules in terms of how we worked with folks like AT&T”:
“AT&T as a company… they buy the cellphones and then they sell them to you and I… we said, ‘no we don’t want to do that’. We want to be able to sell the iPhone. We want to be able to talk directly to the customer. That was a big, big change for the industry.” 
Other than telling some recent stories that have debuted in “Inside Apple,” Borchers also talked about Steve Jobs’ initial mission to create the iPhone, describing the late CEO as wanting to create “the first phone people would fall in love with.” He also discussed how important the multitouch display and having the full “Internet in your pocket” was to the original concept. Before wrapping up his speech, Borchers talked about how the iPhone was developed from his point of view on the product marketing/product management team and the importance of Apple packaging:
