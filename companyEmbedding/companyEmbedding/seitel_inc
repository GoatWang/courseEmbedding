Seitel Inc. Key Developments

Seitel and Schlumberger Announce New 2D Multiclient Reimaging Program Onshore Mexico
Jun 14 17
Seitel and Schlumberger announced a strategic multiclient alliance to reimage and acquire new geophysical data in key areas across onshore Mexico. Approximately 25,000 kilometers of 2D seismic data from Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) data library will be reimaged covering lease blocks in the current Bid Round 2, as well as future onshore lease round blocks. In addition, new multiclient data acquisition projects are already in development. The newly reprocessed seismic data and any new acquisition projects will provide subsurface images of proven oil and gas reservoirs in the Sabina-Burgos, Tampico-Misantla, Veracruz and Sureste areas, as well as the under-explored Chihuahua province, and other strategic areas. The reimaging program covers both conventional and unconventional onshore lease blocks in the areas. Leveraging both companies’ extensive experience in onshore imaging and multiclient projects, the program offers clients the first modern regional seismic images in these areas. Final products over the prolific fields of the Tampico-Misantla Basin are available for license now.


Seitel Inc. Announces Board Changes
Jun 6 17
On June 1, 2017, Mr. Daniel R. Osnoss resigned from the board of directors of Seitel Inc. Mr. Osnoss' resignation did not result from any disagreement with the Company or concern regarding its accounting or financial matters, its operations, policies or practices. Effective as of the same date, Ash Upadhyaya was appointed to the board. Mr. Upadhyaya joined Centerbridge Partners, L.P. in May 2017 as a Managing Director with a focus on investments in the energy sector.


Seitel Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 10 17
Seitel Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $20.6 million, consisting of acquisition underwriting revenue of $6.9 million, resale licensing revenue of $13.2 million and solutions and other revenue of $0.5 million. This compares to total revenue of $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2016, consisting of acquisition underwriting revenue of $5.0 million, resale licensing revenue of $6.5 million and solutions and other revenue of $0.5 million. The increase in total revenue between quarters was primarily due to higher resale licensing revenue. Net loss was $13.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.9 million for the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in the loss between quarters was primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher amortization on seismic data library and lower income tax benefit. Cash flows from operating activities were $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increased collections of cash resales in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from higher levels of cash resale activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017, partially offset by payments of 2016 annual incentive compensation made in 2017 and lower collections of acquisition underwriting revenue as a result of invoice timing. In the first quarter of 2017, net cash capital expenditures totaled $3.7 million. Gross capital expenditures were $10.8 million, of which $7.4 million related to new data acquisition projects primarily located in the Eagle Ford/Woodbine and Louisiana Cotton Valley areas in the U.S. and in the Montney area in Canada. Loss from operations was $7,324,000 compared to $9,132,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $13,585,000 compared to $15,309,000 a year ago. Cash EBITDA was $8,850,000 compared to loss of $1,771,000 a year ago.
