Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results.

Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or other entity responsible for payment, underlying collateral, or changes in economic, political, issuer-specific, or other conditions.  Certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile.  In addition, debt instruments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise, prices usually fall), therefore the Fund's share price may decline during rising rates. Funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations.  At times, and particularly during periods of market turmoil, all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market. As a result, it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price.  The price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments; however, an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity.  
		





Investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, involve leverage (which can magnify losses), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicator(s) on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty and liquidity risk.
		





Investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default, or already be in default, than higher-quality debt instruments. 
		





The market price of common shares of the fund will be based on factors such as the supply and demand for common shares in the market and general market, economic, political or regulatory conditions. Whether shareholders will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares of the fund will depend on the market price of  common shares at the time of the sale, not on the fund’s net asset value. The market price may be lower or higher than the fund’s net asset value. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount or premium to their net asset value.
		





Leverage involves investment exposure in an amount exceeding the initial investment. Leverage can cause increased volatility by magnifying gains or losses.

Definitions
Average Effective Duration: Average Effective Duration is a measure of how much a bond’s price is likely to fluctuate with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
Average Effective Maturity: Average effective maturity is a weighted average of maturity of the bonds held in a portfolio, taking into account any prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons which may shorten the maturity. Longer-maturity funds are generally considered more interest-rate sensitive than shorter maturity funds.












The Funds are closed-end Funds.  Common shares of the Funds are only available for purchase/sale on the NYSE at the current market price(NYSE-MKT for MFS California Municipal Fund). Shares of the Funds are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank.  Shares of the Funds involve investment risk, including possible loss of principal.

 MFS SPECIAL VALUE TRUST (Form: N-30D, Received: 07/10/1995 00:00:00)

THE FIRST NAME IN MUTUAL FUNDS




MFS(R) Special Value Trust



Semiannual Report

April 30, 1995


[graphic] (silhouette of people and window)





Dear Shareholders:


During the six months ended April 30, 1995, the Trust continued to maintain an
annual distribution rate of 11% based on its original New York Stock Exchange
offering price of $15.00 per share. These distributions were paid through a
combination of income earned from dividends, bond coupon payments, paid-in
capital and short-term capital gains. (Thus far this fiscal year, approximately
48% of the Trust's total distributions has been a return of capital.) During the
past six months, the market price of the Trust on the New York Stock Exchange
has traded at a premium to its net asset value, which has ranged between 11.0%
and 16.9%. On April 30, 1995, shares were trading at a 15.3% premium based on
the stock market price of $14.75 and the net asset value of $12.79.



Economic Outlook



As the economy enters its fifth year of expansion, it is evidencing a decidedly
decelerating trend from its robust pace of 1994, when gross domestic product
expanded by 4.1%. Estimated growth in this year's first quarter diminished to an
annual rate of 2.8%. Consumer spending slowed considerably during the quarter
and was accompanied by a correspondingly large increase in inventories. As we
begin the year's second quarter, the evidence suggests that the economy has
entered a phase of less-than-full-potential growth, as the April unemployment
rate showed a second consecutive monthly increase. We expect the economy to
continue to grow at this more subdued pace. We do not anticipate that the
slowdown will deteriorate into a recession and, conversely, we remain mindful of
the potential for a reliquified consumer sector to reassert itself as the year
progresses.



Interest Rates



As evidence of a slowdown has continued to mount, the fixed-income markets have
become increasingly convinced that the Federal Reserve Board has concluded its
monetary-tightening initiatives. Furthermore, as the economy has diminished in
its ability to create jobs and in its usage of available productive capacity,
apprehension concerning a cyclical upturn in inflation has receded. As a result,
long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields have declined to near 7.00% as of April 30,
1995, down from 7.87% at the beginning of the year and from their cyclical peak
of 8.15% in November 1994. Despite higher costs at the crude and intermediate
stages of production, prices have not increased appreciably at the consumer
level. For the 12 months ended in April of this year, the Consumer Price Index,
a popular measure of change in prices, increased by a still moderate 3.1%.
Continued benign growth in labor costs and the inability of many businesses to
effectively raise prices have combined to extend the favorable price
environment. Nevertheless, we do anticipate a minor cyclical pickup in
inflationary pressure this year to the 3% - 3-1/2% range.


The decline in interest rates has been particularly precipitous during the past
month, leaving the market potentially vulnerable to a near-term correction.
However, we believe continuing moderate growth will result in interest rates
trending near to, and possibly somewhat lower than, present levels during the
balance of this year.



Stock Market



The stock market has rebounded from its uninspiring performance during 1994,
posting its strongest quarterly results in four years. Recently, stock prices
have responded to growing confidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end
of its tightening initiatives and that gains in corporate earnings may remain
substantial. Although we expect the economy to slow in 1995, our outlook for
corporate earnings growth remains favorable. We have been de-emphasizing many
cyclical areas such as autos and basic materials because of their less
attractive earnings outlook, and we have been emphasizing growth areas such as
consumer and household products. Despite the potential impact on corporate
profits of a slowing economy, we believe stock prices will respond to continued
growth in profitability.

Portfolio Performance and Strategy



As of April 30, 1995, approximately 75% of the Trust's total net assets was
invested in common and preferred stocks, 17% in high-yield and distressed
corporate bonds, and 8% in cash equivalents. The Trust's investment mandate is
still focused on opportunistic investing in any market or security which we
believe presents attractive risk-adjusted returns. We invest in the high-yield
or "junk" corporate bond market when we are able to buy senior bonds in a
company's capital structure which yield double digit returns, and when we
believe we have significant asset protection to limit our risk. An example of
this type of investment would be GPA, the world's largest aircraft lessor. In
the equity market, our strategy is to buy companies at below-market multiples
that we believe will grow earnings and cash flow faster than market
expectations. Oftentimes, companies like these either are undergoing a financial
or operational restructuring and are not widely followed by Wall Street analysts
or, in our opinion, are not understood well by other investors. Examples of
these opportunities would be IMO Industries, a diversified industrial
manufacturing company, and National Convenience Stores, a Texas-based gas
station operator. We plan to continue our disciplined strategy of value
investing and to wait for market opportunities to present themselves over the
remainder of the year.


We appreciate your support and welcome any questions or comments you may have.


Respectfully,






/S/ A. KEITH BRODKIN

Chairman and President

Dividend Reinvestment and

Cash Purchase Plan


The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan which allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions or only the long-term capital gains
paid by the Trust. Unless the shares are trading at a premium (exceeding net
asset value), purchases are made at the market price. Otherwise, purchases will
be made at a discounted price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market
price, whichever is greater. You can also buy shares of the Trust. Investments
from $100 to $500 can be made in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.


If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.


There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the Trust. However, when shares are bought
on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each participant
pays a pro rata share of the commissions. A service fee of $0.75 is charged for
each cash purchase as well as a pro rata share of the brokerage commissions, if
any. The automatic reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any
income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on the
distributions.


To enroll in or withdraw from the Plan or to receive a brochure providing a
complete description of the Plan, please contact the Plan agent at the address
and telephone number located on the back cover of this report. Please have
available the name of the Trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. When you withdraw from the Plan, you can receive
the value of the reinvested shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of
the full and fractional shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check
for the fractional shares.

Investment Objective and Policy



MFS(R) Special Value Trust's investment objective is to maintain an annual
distribution rate of 11%, based on the original offering price, while seeking
opportunities for capital appreciation.


As opportunities arise in the marketplace, the Trust may invest in securities
that the Trust believes represent uncommon value by having the potential for
significant capital appreciation over a period of 12 months or longer. The
issuers of these securities may include companies out-of-favor in the
marketplace, or in out-of-favor industries, and over- leveraged companies with
promising longer-term prospects. Some of these companies may also be
experiencing financial or operating difficulties.

Notes to Financial Statements



(1) Business and Organization


MFS Special Value Trust (the Trust) is organized as a Massachusetts business
trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as
a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.


(2) Significant Accounting Policies


Investment Valuations -- Equity securities listed on securities exchanges or
reported through the NASDAQ system are valued at last sale prices. Unlisted
equity securities or listed equity securities for which last sale prices are not
available are valued at last quoted bid prices. Debt securities (other than
short-term obligations which mature in 60 days or less), including listed issues
and forward contracts, are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by
dealers or by a pricing service with consideration to factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data, without exclusive reliance upon exchange or over-the-counter prices.
Short-term obligations, which mature in 60 days or less, are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates value. Non-U.S. dollar denominated short-term
obligations are valued at amortized cost as calculated in the base currency and
translated into U.S. dollars at the closing daily exchange rate. Futures
contracts, options and options on futures contracts listed on commodities
exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Over-the-counter options are
valued by brokers through the use of a pricing model which takes into account
closing bond valuations, implied volatility and short-term repurchase rates.
Securities for which there are no such quotations or valuations are valued at
fair value as determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.


Repurchase Agreements -- The Trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the Trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Trust requires
that the securities purchased in a repurchase transaction be transferred to the
custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Trust to obtain those securities
in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The Trust monitors, on
a daily basis, the value of the securities transferred to ensure that the value,
including accrued interest, of the securities under each repurchase agreement is
greater than amounts owed to the Trust under each such repurchase agreement.


Foreign Currency Translation -- Investment valuations, other assets, and
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases and
sales of foreign investments and income and expenses are converted into U.S.
dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of
such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange
rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as
net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to
foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for
financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments
that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not
separately disclosed.


Deferred Organization Expenses -- Costs incurred by the Trust in connection with
its organization have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a five-year period beginning on the date of commencement of
operations of the Trust.


Written Options -- The Trust may write covered call or put options for which
premiums are received and are recorded as liabilities, and are subsequently
adjusted to the current value of the options written. Premiums received from
writing options which expire are treated as realized gains. Premiums received
from writing options which are exercised or are closed are offset against the
proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or
loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the
securities pur-


10





chased by the Trust. The Trust, as writer of an option, may have no control over
whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as
a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the
security underlying the written option. In general, written call options may
serve as a partial hedge against decreases in value in the underlying securities
to the extent of the premium received. Written options may also be used as a
part of an income producing strategy reflecting the view of the Trust's
management on the direction of interest rates.


Futures Contracts -- The Trust may enter into financial futures contracts for
the delayed delivery of securities, currency or contracts based on financial
indices at a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the Trust
is required to deposit either in cash or securities an amount equal to a certain
percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are made or received by
the Trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the
underlying security, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as
unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. The Trust's investment in financial
futures contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated future changes in
interest or exchange rates or securities prices. For example, interest rate
futures may be used in modifying the duration of the portfolio without incurring
the additional transaction costs involved in buying and selling the underlying
securities. Should interest or exchange rates or securities prices move
unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.


Security Loans -- The Trust may lend its securities to member banks of the
Federal Reserve System and to member firms of the New York Stock Exchange or
subsidiaries thereof. The loans are collateralized at all times by cash or
securities with a market value at least equal to the market value of securities
loaned. As with other extensions of credit, the Trust may bear the risk of delay
in recovery or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the
securities fail financially. The Trust receives compensation for lending its
securities in the form of fees or from all or a portion of the income from
investment of the collateral. The Trust would also continue to earn income on
the securities loaned. At April 30, 1995, the Trust had no securities on loan.


Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts -- The Trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The Trust will enter into forward
contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging
purposes, the Trust may enter into contracts to deliver or receive foreign
currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment activities.
It may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect foreign
currency-denominated securities from declines in value due to unfavorable
exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the Trust may enter into
contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the Trust's
portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of anticipated
changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the
daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or losses are
recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized until the contract
settlement date.


Investment Transactions and Income -- Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and original issue discount are amortized or accreted for both financial
statement and tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax
regulations. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends
received in cash. Dividend and interest payments received in additional
securities are recorded on the ex-dividend or ex-interest date in an amount
equal to the value of the security on such date.


The Trust uses the effective interest method for reporting interest income on
payment-in-kind (PIK) bonds, whereby interest income on PIK bonds is recorded
ratably by the Trust at a constant yield to maturity. Legal


11





Notes to Financial Statements -- continued


fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the value of a
security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal fees are
expensed. Capital infusions, which are generally non-recurring, incurred to
protect or enhance the value of high-yield debt securities, are reported as an
addition to the cost basis of the security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate
the terms or conditions of capital infusions or that are expected to result in a
plan of reorganization are considered workout expenses and are reported as
realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance an investment, or
costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are reported as
operating expenses.


Tax Matters and Distributions -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.


The Trust files a tax return annually using tax accounting methods required
under provisions of the Code which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles, the basis on which these financial statements are prepared.
Accordingly, the amount of net investment income and net realized gains reported
on these financial statements may differ from that reported on the Trust's tax
return and, consequently, the character of distributions to shareholders
reported in the financial highlights may differ from that reported to
shareholders on Form 1099-DIV. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.


The Trust distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
reporting basis and requires that only distributions in excess of tax basis
earnings and profits are reported in the financial statements as a return of
capital. Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or accumulated net realized
gains. It is anticipated that some portion of the Trust's distributions will be
a non-taxable return of capital, but the amount of this return of capital cannot
yet be determined.


(3) Transactions with Affiliates


Investment Adviser -- The Trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee, computed daily and paid monthly at an effective annual rate of
0.68% of average daily net assets and 3.4% of investment income, amounted to
$285,387 for the six months ended April 30, 1995.


The Trust pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are officers of the
investment adviser, or to officers of the Trust, all of whom receive
remuneration for their services to the Trust from MFS. Certain of the officers
and Trustees of the Trust are officers or directors of MFS, MFS Fund
Distributors, Inc. (MFD) and MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The Trust has an
unfunded defined benefit plan for all its independent Trustees. Included in
Trustees' compensation is a net periodic pension expense of $7,315 for the six
months ended April 30, 1995.


Transfer Agent -- Commencing August 15, 1994, the Trust entered into an
agreement with MFSC to act as registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the
Trust. The agreement provides that the Trust will pay MFSC an account
maintenance fee and a dividend services fee and will reimburse MFSC for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The account maintenance fee is computed as
follows:








Total Number of Accounts       Annual Account Fee
- ------------------------       ------------------
Less than 75,000                      $9.00
75,000 and over                       $8.00








12





The dividend services fee is $0.75 per dividend reinvestment and $0.75 per cash
infusion. Fees incurred under the agreement for the six months ended April 30,
1995 amounted to $14,531.


(4) Portfolio Securities


Purchases and sales of investments, other than purchased option transactions and
short-term obligations, were as follows:








                                                   Purchases          Sales

Investments (non-U.S. government securities)      $31,024,700       $36,238,791
                                                  -----------       -----------








The cost and unrealized appreciation or depreciation in value of the investments
owned by the Trust, as computed on a federal income tax basis, are as follows:








Aggregate cost                                          $71,511,512
                                                        ===========

                                                        -----------
   Net unrealized appreciation                          $ 2,824,894
                                                        ===========
(5) Shares of Beneficial Interest








The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited number of
full and fractional shares of

beneficial interest (without par value). Transactions in Trust shares were as
follows:








                                                                       Six Months Ended               Year Ended

Notes to Financial Statements -- continued


(7) Line of Credit


The Trust entered into an agreement which enables it to participate with other
funds managed by MFS, or an affiliate of MFS, in an unsecured line of credit
with a bank which permits borrowings up to $350 million, collectively.
Borrowings may be made to temporarily finance the acquisition of Treasury
shares. Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate
equal to the bank's base rate. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the
average daily unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each quarter. The commitment fee allocated to
the Trust for the six months ended April 30, 1995 was $583.


(8) Restricted Securities


The Trust may invest not more than 20% of its net assets in securities which are
subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. At April 30, 1995, the
Trust owned the following restricted securities (constituting 1.32% of net
assets) which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities
Act of 1933. The Trust does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. The value of these securities is determined by valuations supplied
by a pricing service or brokers or, if not available, in good faith by or at the
direction of the Trustees. Certain of these securities may be offered and sold
to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A of the 1933 Act.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors




To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Special Value Trust:



We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Special Value Trust, including the schedule of portfolio investments, as of
April 30, 1995, the related statement of operations for the six- month period
then ended, and the statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights
for the six- month period then ended and for the year ended October 31, 1994.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. The financial
highlights for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1993 and
for the period from November 24, 1989 (commencement of investment operations) to
October 31, 1990 were audited by other auditors whose report dated December 16,
1993 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements and financial
highlights.


We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial
highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of April
30, 1995, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other
appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS
Special Value Trust as of April 30, 1995, the results of its operations for the
six-month period then ended, and the changes in its net assets and the financial
highlights for the six- month period then ended and for the year ended October
31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
*Other fees and commissions apply to a WellsTrade® account. For complete information on fees and commissions refer to the WellsTrade® Account Commissions and Fee Schedule on wellsfargo.com
