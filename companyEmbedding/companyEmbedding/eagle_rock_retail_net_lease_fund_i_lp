 This post discusses why common unit holders of Eagle Rock Energy Partners, LP (NASDAQ:EROC) should vote NO to the most recently proposed recapitalization. We have set up a website at www.fair-eroc.com where we explain why we believe unit holders should vote NO. That website discusses EROC’s current recapitalization proposal, while this post discusses EROC’s background, business and the stock’s potential total return if NGL prices stay roughly constant.

  Eagle Rock Energy Partners, LP trades under the ticker EROC on Nasdaq. EROC is an oil and natural gas MLP. We are holders of EROC common units. On January 14, 2010, EROC issued a preliminary proxy regarding a recapitalization transaction with its sponsor Natural Gas Partners (“NGP”), and the transaction will likely be voted on by public common holders at some point in the next 6 months. We urge common unit holders to vote NO to the NGP proposal, unless it is substantially modified. This post will explain why we think the current transaction is adverse to common unit holders’ interests, as well as discuss an investment in EROC in general. We have set up a website at www.fair-eroc.com, where we explain why common holders should vote NO to the current transaction. If you are an EROC unitholder, please distribute the link to other public holders. The site and analysis will be updated as revised proposals or other relevant facts emerge. Accounts managed by Kerrisdale currently hold EROC, and we may buy or sell shares at any time. We will not disclose our sale if and when we sell, and we will not necessarily disclose that we have changed our thesis if we discover something faulty with our analysis at a later date. Our excel model, historical financials and various EROC analyses can be downloaded here. Recapitalization EROC owns various oil and natural gas assets, of both the midstream and upstream varieties, and it suspended its dividend in early 2009 due to declining commodity prices and a potential debt covenant breach in 2010. The proposed recapitalization aims to reduce leverage to avoid a covenant default. On www.fair-eroc.com, we explain why we believe EROC unit holders should vote NO to the current proposed recapitalization. On that site, we go through three scenarios: 1) No recapitalization 2) Currently Proposed Recapitalization 3) A Fair and Appropriate Recapitalization The aptly named “Fair and Appropriate Recapitalization” is our preferred course. It is very similar to the currently proposed recapitalization, but removes a $29mm fee to EROC’s sponsor. If the currently proposed transaction is rejected by unit holders, we believe that the Board of Directors will be compelled to adopt a transaction very similar to our suggested “Fair and Appropriate Recapitalization”. If they don’t, we think they would be potentially breaching their fiduciary duty, and be exposed to lawsuits. We are not going to rehash in this post our discussion of the recapitalization scenarios that is currently on www.fair-eroc.com. Instead, we’ll discuss EROC’s business and potential stock valuation. Business Overview: Eagle Rock Energy Partners, LP is a master limited partnership engaged in three businesses: (i) gathering, compressing, treating, processing and transporting natural gas; fractionating and transporting natural gas liquids (“NGLs”); and marketing natural gas, condensate and NGLs, which we will call its “Midstream Business”; (ii) acquiring, developing and producing interests in oil and natural gas properties, which we call its “Upstream Business”; and (iii) acquiring and managing fee mineral, overriding royalty and royalty interests, either through direct ownership or through investment in other partnerships, which we call its “Minerals Business” Excluding hedges, the midstream, upstream and minerals businesses accounted for 59%, 32% and 9% of 2008 EBITDA, respectively. The Midstream Business owns assets in five natural gas producing regions: (i) the Texas Panhandle; (ii) East Texas/Louisiana; (iii) South Texas; (iv) West Texas; and (v) the Gulf of Mexico. These five regions are productive, mature, natural gas producing basins that have historically experienced significant drilling activity. As of 12/31/08, Eagle Rock’s natural gas gathering systems within these regions represent approximately 5,200 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines with approximately 2,600 well connections, 18 natural gas processing plants with approximately 801 MMcf/d of plant processing capacity and 207,100 horsepower of compression. The Midstream Business averaged 450.8 MMcf/d of gathered volumes and 322.1 MMcf/d of processed volumes during 2008. The Upstream Business has long-lived, high working interest properties located in four natural gas producing regions: (i) Southern Alabama; (ii) East Texas; (iii) South Texas; and (iv) West Texas. As of 12/31/08, these working interest properties included 321 operated productive wells and 142 non-operated wells with net production of approximately 5,600 Boe/d and proved reserves of approximately 40 Bcf of natural gas, 7.2 MMBbls of crude oil, and 5.6 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, of which 85% are proved developed producing. The Minerals business is likely to be sold, so we are not going to focus on it. We will however say that it is a valuable asset comprised of a portfolio of royalty interests in various productive wells in 17 states. The segment will generate $14mm to $15mm of EBITDA in 2009, and keep in mind that 2009 suffered from what could very well be trough energy prices. As well, 2009 figures don’t include any lease bonuses, rentals or other one-time bonus payments, whereas 2008 benefited from $17mm of such “recurring non-recurring” bonus payments. The minerals business has minimal capex / working capital uses. At 12x trough cash flow, we think that Black Stone is getting an excellent deal, and they’ve aggressively pursued this asset ever since EROC first indicated it might sell the minerals division. In the originally proposed restructuring, NGP had arranged to purchase this business for $135mm, an extremely low price, but Black Stone’s persistence and unsolicited proposal shortly after the initial recapitalization announcement prompted the board to recommend selling it to Black Stone. EROC was essentially created in 2006 when Natural Gas Partners, a $7bn energy-focused private equity firm formed the partnership as a monetization vehicle. NGP and management own the publicly traded partnership’s general partner, all subordinated units, and about 26% of the common units. The general partner is entitled to an increasing share of cash flow as specific dividend benchmarks are met, and these are captured through what are called “Incentive Distribution Rights”. After going public in 2006, EROC completed more than half a dozen acquisitions totaling over $800 million, including multiple deals involving oil and natural gas production assets and fee mineral and royalty interests. As a result, EROC has become a hybrid MLP with midstream natural gas assets, upstream oil & gas assets, and fee minerals / royalty interests. The margins generated under some of EROC’s gathering and processing contracts, particularly its keep-whole and percentage-of-proceeds contracts, fluctuate based on the price of natural gas and NGLs and, in some cases, the relationship between the price of natural gas and NGLs. Its upstream assets are directly levered to energy prices. EROC attempts to hedge its commodity price exposure through the use of various financial instruments. In the second half of 2008, the rapid decline of commodity prices had adverse impacts that ultimately led to a rise in forecasted leverage and a cut in the Company’s unit holder distribution. Cash was redirected towards reducing debt. Per its partnership agreement, when EROC suspends its common distribution, all quarterly distributions under $0.3625 per share are accumulated as arrearages. The Company must repay these arrearages to common holders before subordinated holders get any distributions. Because the Company suspended its distribution in early 2009, $1.01 of arrearages have accumulated through to September 30, 2009. Unless commodity prices surge, subordinated holders are unlikely to receive any distributions over the next several years, which explains NGP’s eagerness to do a deal that replaces their subordinated units with newly issued common units. Financials We have attached our quarterly excel model of EROC here. Please note that this is our internal model at Kerrisdale Capital, using publicly available information and our own internal assumptions. Most notably, our projections do not match the Company’s projections. Our EBITDA comes out higher than the Company’s base standalone model, as can be seen by the following comparison:  The differences are due to numerous reasons. We don’t have any reason to believe that our model is more accurate than the Company’s. And really, we build models to better understand the business drivers of our portfolio companies, and are fully aware that our assumptions and profit forecasts may be wrong. We don’t have access to the same detailed information as the Company does, nor have we spent as much time analyzing EROC’s underlying trends as its CFO has. At the end of the day, our EBITDA forecasts are not terribly different from the Company’s. In our valuation analyses below, we use the Company’s projections. Valuation MLPs trade on dividend yields, to a large degree. Based on the Company’s projections, EROC would have $82mm of distributable cash flow in 2010 and $89mm in 2011, in a standalone base case. If the transaction is approved, 2010 and 2011 DCF would be $76mm and $104mm. The dramatic difference in 2011 is due to higher interest costs in the standalone case following a 4Q 2010 covenant breach, based on the Company’s assumption that interest rates would rise 250bps. The Company’s new distribution policy will establish a conservative baseline distribution that will be expected to be lower as a percentage of total distributable cash flow than many other MLPs. The rationale for this is that EROC’s underlying assets are exposed to more commodity price risk than other MLPs. The Company has projected a $0.40 – $0.60 annualized distribution if the current transaction is approved. In our analysis, we assume that distributions begin at $0.60, rising to $0.75 in 1Q11 and rising to approximately $0.85 – $0.95 in 4Q11. These amounts are less than 75% of distributable cash flow in each relevant period. In 4Q11, we assume a distribution equal to 70% of distributable cash flow. These are fairly conservative payout ratios.  If the recapitalization transaction is rejected and no modified recapitalization occurs, we estimate a 60% cumulative 2-year gain by purchasing EROC at Monday’s closing price of $6.31, IF management decides to re-instate a regular distribution at the approximate 4x leverage that the Company would have at the end of 2011. If the current recapitalization transaction is approved, we estimate a 81% 2-year total return. If the currently proposed recapitalization is rejected, and management chooses to do a modified recapitalization where they sell the Minerals business and do a rights offering, but don’t pay the unwarranted $29mm fee to NGP, we estimate an 87% 2-year total return for common unit holders. Commodity Price Risk EROC is a commodity business. Both the upstream and midstream businesses have exposure to energy prices, and, specifically, EROC is highly levered to natural gas liquids prices. NGLs refer to ethane, propane, iso butane, normal butane, ethane and pentane, and the pricing of these products drive the company’s earnings. Arguing that EROC should generate attractive returns as long as NGL prices stay constant is a bit like arguing that EROC should generate attractive returns as long as the coin I flip lands on heads. Forecasting the direction of the NGL price deck is tough. Unlike other commodities (natural gas and crude oil) that have a somewhat transparent relationship between supply and demand (at least when compared to NGLs), fundamentals for natural gas liquids are driven by a complicated interplay of a host of hard-to-predict factors. NGL supply, demand, and prices are driven by markets that function independently of NGL fundamentals. On the supply side, NGL supply is largely a function of the quality and level of natural gas production, rather than being responsive to NGL demand. This is because NGLs must be extracted from natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications. In contrast, domestic demand for NGLs can fluctuate based on a number of drivers, including the overall demand by petrochemical companies, which is driven by economic activity; NGL exports, which are driven by ethylene production levels abroad and global demand for ethylene derivative products; and the economics of using a light (NGL-based) versus a heavy (crude oil based) feedstock in petrochemical steam crackers to produce ethylene and other products. All of this said, NGL prices have historically been driven by crude oil prices moreso than the overall supply / demand dynamics of the NGL market. According to a Wachovia report in April 2009 (“Cracking the Code on Natural Gas Liquids”), NGL prices exhibit a higher correlation to crude oil prices than to NGL supply and demand imbalances. Wachovia tracked benchmark ethane and WTI prices since 2001, and noticed a 0.93 correlation between the price of ethane and crude oil. The reason is that light-feed NGL components compete with crude oil feedstocks (naphtha and gas oil) in the petrochemical industry, which is the primary end market for NGLs. If oil prices increase 50%, other crude refinery byproducts like naphtha and gas oil will follow directionally, and as those byproducts become more expensive relative to NGLs, ethylene producers will opt for a higher percentage of NGLs in their feedstock mix and NGL prices will rise. And vice versa. EROC’s upstream business is also tilted towards oil vs natural gas, with more than 60% of 2008 upstream gross profit coming from oil and NGLs. On the natural gas side, EROC’s natural gas short position is generally offset by its gross profit from the natural gas production in its upstream business. So it’s really oil / NGL pricing that drives EROC’s earnings. The question of whether crude trades at $60 vs. $80 vs $100+ a barrel in 2011 will probably have a bigger impact on EROC’s stock performance than how investors vote on the current recapitalization. In its crudest form (pardon the pun), an investment in EROC is just one of many ways to invest in oil. Conclusion Common unit holders should vote NO to the current recapitalization proposal outlined in the January 14, 2010 proxy.

HFF closes $38 million sale of northern NJ multi-housing community
PHILADELPHIA, PA - June 11, 2014 – HFF announced today that it has closed the sale of Presidential Place, a 150-unit, Class A multi-housing community in Lebanon, New Jersey.
HFF arranged the sale in an off market transaction between Pizzo & Pizzo (seller) and Eagle Rock Multi-Family Property Fund (buyer) for $38 million or $253,000 per unit.
Completed in 2011, Presidential Place is a luxurious community that features six-buildings with one-, two- and three-bedroom units that are 95 percent leased. Community amenities include a clubhouse with fitness center and swimming pool. The property is located at 710 Presidential Drive about 45 miles west of New York City in Lebanon, New Jersey. The property has visibility from Interstate 78 with convenient access to Interstate 287 as well as Routes 202/206, 31 and 22.
The HFF investment sales team was led by senior managing directors Zac Pierce and Mark Thomson of HFF Philadelphia in collaboration with Jose Cruz of HFF’s New Jersey office.
“Eaglerock was a pleasure to work with and seamlessly executed this transaction in spite of a few challenges,” said Pierce. “Each party achieved their desired result as Pizzo & Pizzo were able to sell an outlier property out of their portfolio, and Eaglerock was able to acquire the highest quality asset in the market.”
Pizzo & Pizzo is a New Jersey-based developer with a long tradition of building high quality assets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania with exceptional unit finishes and best in class amenity packages which is true for Presidential Place.
UOB Eagle Rock Multifamily Property Fund LP (the “Fund”) is a real estate private equity fund developed to make investments in U.S. suburban multi-family housing communities.  The Fund will focus on the New York metropolitan region, as well as communities along the densely populated Northeastern corridor of the United States, namely from Boston to Washington D.C.

~ Steve P, Investor, Dallas Texas
“The objective number-driven analytics took the “sales” part out of the equation, leaving me with a property I understood and was comfortable with. No high pressure sales, just the facts. I love it!”
~ Mike H, Investor, Scottsdale Arizona








Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.

Common Areas (as defined below), the land upon which the same are
located, along with all other buildings and improvements thereon or
thereunder, including all parking facilities. Landlord hereby
leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord, upon all
of the conditions set forth herein the Premises, together with the
non-exclusive right to use the Common Areas as hereinafter
specified. The Premises shall not include an easement for light,
air or view.


 


2.2  
Calculation of Size of Building
and Premises . All
provisions included in this Lease relating to the number of
rentable square feet in the Premises, including, but not limited
to, Base Rent and Tenant’s Share, shall reflect the number of
rentable square feet in the Premises and in the Building. The
calculation of the number of rentable square feet in the Premises
is specified in Section 1.3 hereinabove.


 


2.3  
Common Areas-Defined
. The term “Common
Areas” is defined as all areas and facilities outside the
Premises and within the exterior boundary line of the Project that
are designated by Landlord from time to time for the general
non-exclusive use of Landlord, Tenant and the other tenants of the
Project and their respective employees, suppliers, customers and
invitees, including, but not limited to, common entrances, lobbies,
corridors, stairwells, public restrooms, elevators, parking areas,
loading and unloading areas, roadways and sidewalks. Landlord may
also designate other land and improvements outside the boundaries
of the Project to be a part of the Common Areas, provided that such
other land and improvements have a reasonable and functional
relationship to the Project.


 


3.  
Term.


 


3.1  
Term and Commencement
Date . The Term and
Commencement Date of this Lease are as specified in Sections 1.6
and 1.7. The Commencement Date set forth in Section 1.7 is an
estimated Commencement Date. Subject to the limitations contained
in Section 3.3 below, the actual Commencement Date shall be the
date possession of the Premises is tendered to Tenant in accordance
with Section 3.4 below; provided, however, that if the Commencement
Date is other than the first day of a month, then the Term of this
Lease shall be computed from the first day of the calendar month
following the Commencement Date. When the actual Commencement Date
is established by Landlord, Tenant shall, within ten (10) business
days after Landlord’s request, complete and execute the
letter attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and deliver it to
Landlord. Tenant’s failure to execute the letter attached
hereto as Exhibit “B” within said ten (10) business day
period shall be a default hereunder and shall constitute
Tenant’s acknowledgment of the truth of the facts contained
in the letter delivered by Landlord to Tenant.


 


3.2  
Delay in Possession
. Notwithstanding the estimated
Commencement Date specified in Section 1.7, if for any reason
Landlord cannot deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on
said date, Landlord shall not be subject to any liability therefor,
nor shall such failure affect the validity of this Lease or the
obligations of Tenant hereunder; provided, however, in such a case,
the Term shall not commence and Tenant shall not be obligated to
pay rent or perform any other obligation of Tenant under this
Lease, except as may be otherwise provided in this Lease, until
possession of the Premises is tendered to Tenant, as defined in
Section 3.4. If Landlord shall not have tendered possession of the
Premises to Tenant within one hundred thirty-five (135) days
following the estimated Commencement Date specified in Section 1.7,
as the same may be extended in accordance with Section 3.3 or under
the terms of any work letter agreement entered into by Landlord and
Tenant, Tenant may, at Tenant’s option, by notice in writing
to Landlord within ten (10) days after the expiration of the one
hundred thirty-five (135) day period, terminate this Lease. If
Tenant terminates this Lease as provided in the preceding sentence,
the parties shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder,
except that Landlord shall return any money previously deposited
with Landlord by Tenant; and provided further, that if such written
notice by Tenant is not received by Landlord within said ten (10)
day period, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate this Lease
as provided above unless Landlord fails to tender possession of the
Premises to Tenant within one hundred eighty (180) days following
the estimated Commencement Date specified in Section 1.7, as the
same may be extended in accordance with Section 3.3 or under any
work letter agreement entered into by Landlord and Tenant. If
Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant
on the Commencement Date due to a “Force Majeure
Event,” the Commencement Date shall be extended by the period
of the delay caused by the Force Majeure Event. A Force Majeure
Event shall mean fire, earthquake, weather delays or other acts of
God, strikes, boycotts, war, riot, insurrection, embargoes,
shortages of equipment, labor or materials, delays in issuance of
governmental permits or approvals, or any other cause beyond the
reasonable control of Landlord.


 


3.3  
Delays Caused by
Tenant . There shall be
no abatement of rent, and the one hundred thirty-five (135) day
period and the one hundred eighty (180) day period specified in
Section 3.2 shall be deemed extended, to the extent of any delays
caused solely by acts or omissions of Tenant, Tenant’s
agents, employees and contractors, or for Tenant delays as defined
in the work letter agreement attached to this Lease, if any
(hereinafter “Tenant Delays”). Tenant shall pay to
Landlord an amount equal to one thirtieth (1/30th) of the Base Rent
due for the first full calendar month of the Term for each day of
Tenant Delay. Landlord and Tenant agree that the foregoing payment
constitutes a fair and reasonable estimate of the damages Landlord
will incur as the result of a Tenant Delay. Within thirty (30) days
after Landlord tenders possession of the Premises to Tenant,
Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord’s reasonable
estimate of the date Landlord could have delivered possession of
the Premises to Tenant but for the Tenant Delays. After delivery of
said notice, Tenant shall immediately pay to Landlord the amount
described above for the period of Tenant Delay.


 


3.4  
Tender of Possession
. Possession of the Premises shall
be deemed tendered to Tenant when Landlord’s architect or
agent has determined that (a) the improvements to be provided
by Landlord pursuant to a work letter agreement, if any, are
substantially completed and, if necessary have been approved by the
appropriate governmental entity in order for Tenant to initially
legally occupy the Premises (for example, a temporary occupancy
certificate shall be sufficient to meet this requirement),
(b) the Project utilities are ready for use in the Premises,
(c) Tenant has reasonable access to the Premises, and
(d) three (3) days shall have expired following advance
written notice to Tenant of the occurrence of the matters described
in (a), (b) and (c) above of this Section 3.4. If improvements to
the Premises are constructed by Landlord, the improvements shall be
deemed “substantially”

 


 



3





 


 
completed when
the improvements have been completed except for minor items or
defects which can be completed or remedied after Tenant occupies
the Premises without causing substantial interference with Tenants
use of the Premises.

 


3.5  
Early Possession
. If Tenant occupies the Premises
prior to the Commencement Date, such occupancy shall be subject to
all provisions of this Lease, such occupancy shall not change the
termination date, and, except as provided below, Tenant shall pay
Base Rent and all other charges provided for in this Lease during
the period of such occupancy. Provided that Tenant does not
interfere with or delay the completion by Landlord or its agents or
contractors of the construction of any tenant improvements, Tenant
shall have the right to enter the Premises up to fourteen (14) days
prior to the anticipated Commencement Date for the purpose of
installing furniture, trade fixtures, equipment, and similar items.
Provided that Tenant has not begun operating its business from the
Premises, and subject to all of the terms and conditions of the
Lease, the foregoing activity shall not constitute the delivery of
possession of the Premises to Tenant and neither the Lease Term nor
Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent shall commence as a
result of said activities. Prior to entering the Premises Tenant
shall obtain all insurance it is required to obtain by the Lease
and shall provide certificates of said insurance to
Landlord.


 


4.  
Rent.


 


4.1  
Base Rent (also referred to as
“Fixed Rent”) . Subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided
in Section 5 of the Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Base
Rent for the Premises set forth in Section 1.8, without offset or
deduction on the first day of each calendar month. At the time
Tenant executes this Lease it shall pay to Landlord the advance
Base Rent described in Section 1.9. Base Rent for any period during
the Term hereof which is for less than one month shall be prorated
based upon the actual number of days of the calendar month
involved. Base Rent and all other amounts payable to Landlord
hereunder shall be payable to Landlord in lawful money of the
United States at the address stated herein or to such other persons
or at such other places as Landlord may designate in
writing.


 


See Addendum Paragraph
1

 


5.  
Adjustments in Rent (also
referred to as “Additional Rent”).


 


5.1  
Operating Expense
Increases . Commencing on
the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and thereafter
throughout the Term, Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord
during the Term hereof, in addition to the Base Rent,
Tenant’s Share of the amount by which all Operating Expenses
for each Comparison Year exceeds the amount of all Operating
Expenses for the Base Year. If less than 95% of the rentable square
feet in the Project is occupied by tenants or Landlord is not
supplying services to 95% of the rentable square feet of the
Project at any time during any calendar year (including the Base
Year), Operating Expenses for such calendar year shall be an amount
equal to the Operating Expenses which would normally be expected to
be incurred had 95% of the Project’s rentable square feet
been occupied and had Landlord been supplying services to 95% of
the Project’s rentable square feet throughout such calendar
year. Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense increases shall be
determined in accordance with the following provisions:


 


(a)   “Base
Year” as used in this Section 5, shall mean the calendar year
(January through December) set forth in Section 1.12.


 


(b)  
“Tenant’s Share” is defined as the percentage set
forth in Section 1.11, which percentage has been determined by
dividing the number of rentable square feet attributed to the
Premises by the total number of rentable square feet in the
Building and multiplying the resulting quotient by one hundred
(100). In the event that the number of rentable square feet in the
Building or the Premises changes, Tenant’s Share shall be
adjusted in the year the change occurs, and Tenant’s Share
for such year shall be determined on the basis of the days during
such year that each Tenant’s Share was in effect.


 


(c)   “Comparison
Year” is defined as each calendar year during the Term of
this Lease subsequent to the Base Year. Tenant’s Share of the
Operating Expense increases for the last Comparison Year of the
Term shall be prorated according to that portion of such Comparison
Year as to which Tenant is responsible for a share of such
increase.


 


(d)   “Operating
Expenses” shall be computed in accordance with generally
accepted real estate accounting practices and shall include all
costs, expenses and fees incurred by Landlord in connection with or
attributable to the Project, including but not limited to, the
following items: (i) all costs, expenses and fees associated
with or attributable to the ownership, management, operation,
repair, maintenance, improvement, alteration and replacement of the
Project, or any part thereof, including but not limited to, the
following: (A) all surfaces, coverings, decorative items,
carpets, drapes, window coverings, parking areas, loading and
unloading areas, trash areas, roadways, sidewalks, stairways,
landscaped areas, striping, bumpers, irrigation systems, lighting
facilities, building exteriors and roofs, fences and gates;
(B) all heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment
(“HVAC”), plumbing, mechanical, electrical systems,
life safety systems and equipment, telecommunication equipment,
elevators, escalators, tenant directories, fire detection systems
including sprinkler system maintenance and repair; (ii) the
cost of trash disposal, janitorial services and security services
and systems; (iii) the cost of all insurance purchased by
Landlord and enumerated in Section 9 of this Lease, including any
deductibles; (iv) Real Property Taxes (defined in Section
5.2(b) below); (v) the cost of water, sewer, gas, electricity,
and other utilities available at the Project and paid by Landlord;
(vi) the cost of labor, salaries and applicable fringe
benefits incurred by Landlord; (vii) the cost of materials,
supplies and tools used in managing, maintaining and/or cleaning
the Project; (viii) the reasonable cost of accounting fees,
management fees, legal fees and consulting fees attributable to the
ownership, operation, management, maintenance and repair of the
Project plus the cost of any space occupied by the property manager
and leasing agent (if Landlord is the property manager, Landlord
shall be entitled to receive a fair market management fee);
(ix) the cost of replacing and/or adding improvements mandated
by any law, statute, regulation or directive of any governmental
agency and any repairs or removals necessitated thereby;
(x) personal property taxes imposed upon the

 


 



4





 


 
fixtures,
machinery, equipment, furniture and personal property used in
connection with the operation of the Project; (xi) payments
made by Landlord under any easement, license, operating agreement,
declaration, restrictive covenant, or instrument pertaining to the
payment or sharing of costs among property owners; and
(xii) the cost of any other service provided by Landlord or
any cost that is elsewhere stated in this Lease to be an
“Operating Expense.” Landlord shall have the right but
not the obligation, from time to time, to equitably allocate some
or all of the Operating Expenses among different tenants of the
Project (the “Cost Pools”). Such Cost Pools may
include, but shall not be limited to, the office space tenants of
the Project and the retail space tenants of the Project.

 


(e)   Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.1 of the
Lease, Operating Expenses expressly exclude the
following:


 


(i)   costs associated
with leasing space in the Building or the sale of any interest in
the Building, including, without limitation, advertising and
marketing, commissions or any amounts paid for or on behalf of
tenants of the Project such as space planning, moving costs, rental
and other tenant concessions;


 


(ii)   costs of
renovating or otherwise improving space for new tenants or in
renovating space vacated by any tenant;


 


(iii)   any interest and
principal payments due under any mortgage or any other
non-operating debt encumbering the Project;


 


(iv)   depreciation and
amortization of the Building or any equipment, machinery, fixtures
or improvements therein except for amortization of capital
improvements specifically permitted in the Lease;


 


(v)   costs incurred by
Landlord for capital improvements, except for the cost incurred for
such capital improvements made: (A) to conform with laws
(which are amended, become effective, or are interpreted or
enforced differently after the date of this Lease; (B) to
provide or maintain Building standards (other than Building
standard tenant improvements); or (C) with the primary purpose
of reducing or controlling increases in Operating Expenses, such as
lighting retrofit and installation of energy management
systems;


 


(vi)   any expense for
which Landlord is reimbursed from Tenant, any other tenant of the
Project, or under the terms of any insurance policy, warranty, or
condemnation award;


 


(vii)   reserves for
repairs, maintenance and replacements or bad-debt or rent
loss;


 


(viii)   any amounts which
would otherwise be included in Operating Expenses paid to any
person, firm or corporation related or otherwise affiliated with
Landlord or any general partner, officer or director of Landlord or
any of its general partners, to the extent same exceeds arms-length
competitive prices paid in the Hanover, New Jersey area for the
services or goods provided (i.e., that portion of the costs and
expenses for such services that exceed the competitive rate shall
not be included in Operating Expenses);


 


(ix)   Landlord’s
general corporate overhead and general and administrative expenses
except as it relates specifically to the actual management of the
Project;


 


(x)   costs of
electricity sold to tenants of the Building by Landlord or any
other special service or benefit to the tenants or service or
benefit in excess of that furnished to Tenant whether or not
Landlord receives reimbursement from such tenants as an additional
charge;


 


(xi)   ground rent
payments;


 


(xii)   salaries, wages
and benefits of any employee above the level of senior property
manager; or any salary, wages, or other compensation or benefits
for off-site employees applicable to the time spent working at
other buildings, other than the Building manager (provided that
with respect to each employee that services the Building and other
buildings, a pro rata portion of such employee’s salary shall
be included in Operating Expenses);


 


(xiii)   all “tenant
allowances”, “tenant concessions” and other costs
or expenses incurred in completing, fixturing, furnishing,
renovating or otherwise improving, decorating or redecorating space
for tenants or other occupants of the Building, or vacant lease
space in the Building including space planning fees; and


 


(xiv)   costs incurred in
connection with the sale, selling or change of ownership of the
Building, including brokerage commissions, attorneys’ and
accountants’ fees, closing costs, title insurance premiums,
transfer taxes and interest charges.


 


(f)   If the cost
incurred in making an improvement or replacing any equipment is not
fully deductible as an expense in the year incurred in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, the cost shall be
amortized over the useful life of the improvement or equipment, as
reasonably determined by Landlord, together with an interest factor
of ten percent (10%) per annum on the unamortized cost of such
item:


 


(g)   Tenant’s
Share of Operating Expense increases shall be payable by Tenant
within thirty (30) days after a reasonably detailed statement of
actual expenses is presented to Tenant by Landlord. At
Landlord’s option, however, Landlord may, from time to time,
estimate what Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense increases
will be, and

 


 



5





 


 
the same shall
be payable by Tenant monthly during each Comparison Year of the
Term of the Lease, on the same day as the Base Rent is due
hereunder. In the event that Tenant pays Landlord’s estimate
of Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense increases, Landlord
shall use its best efforts to deliver to Tenant within one hundred
fifty (150) days after the expiration of each Comparison Year a
reasonably detailed statement (the “Statement”) showing
Tenant’s Share of the actual Operating Expense increases
incurred during such year. Landlord’s failure to deliver the
Statement to Tenant within said period shall not constitute
Landlord’s waiver of its right to collect said amounts or
otherwise prejudice Landlord’s rights hereunder. If
Tenant’s payments under this Section 5.1(g) during said
Comparison Year exceed Tenant’s Share as indicated on the
Statement, Tenant shall be entitled to credit the amount of such
overpayment against Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense
increases next falling due. If Tenant’s payments under this
Section 5.1(g) during said Comparison Year were less than
Tenant’s Share as indicated on the Statement, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord the amount of the deficiency within thirty (30)
days after delivery by Landlord to Tenant of the Statement.
Landlord and Tenant shall forthwith adjust between them by cash
payment any balance determined to exist with respect to that
portion of the last Comparison Year for which Tenant is responsible
for Operating Expense increases, notwithstanding that the Term of
the Lease may have terminated before the end of such Comparison
Year; and this provision shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease.

 


(h)   The computation of
Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense increases is intended to
provide a formula for the sharing of costs by Landlord and Tenant
and will not necessarily result in the reimbursement to Landlord of
the exact costs it has incurred.


 


(i)   if Tenant disputes
the amount set forth in the Statement, Tenant shall have the right,
at Tenant’s sole expense, not later than sixty (60) days
following receipt of such Statement, to cause Landlord’s
books and records in respect to the calendar year which is the
subject of the Statement to be audited by a certified public
accountant mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant. The audit
shall take place at the offices of Landlord where its books and
records are located at a mutually convenient time during
Landlord’s regular business hours. Before conducting any
audit, Tenant must pay the full amount of Operating Expenses
billed. Tenant shall have no right to conduct an audit or to give
Landlord notice that it desires to conduct an audit at any time
Tenant is in default under the Lease. The accountant conducting the
audit shall not be compensated based upon a percentage of
overcharges it discovers. No subtenant shall have any right to
conduct an audit, and no assignee shall conduct an audit for any
period during which such assignee was not in possession of the
Premises. Tenant’s right to undertake an audit with respect
to any calendar year shall expire sixty (60) days after
Tenant’s receipt of the Statement for such calendar year, and
such Statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant and shall, as
between the parties, be conclusively deemed correct, at the end of
such sixty (60) day period, unless prior thereto Tenant shall have
given Landlord written notice of its intention to audit Operating
Expenses for the calendar year which is the subject of the
Statement. If Tenant gives Landlord notice of its intention to
audit Operating Expenses, it must commence such audit within sixty
(60) days after such notice is delivered to Landlord, and the audit
must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after such
notice is delivered to Landlord. If Tenant does not commence and
complete the audit within such periods, the Statement which Tenant
elected to audit shall be deemed final and binding upon Tenant and
shall, as between the parties, be conclusively deemed correct. If
the parties agree to the results of such audit, Tenant’s
Share of Operating Expenses shall be appropriately adjusted based
upon the results of such audit, and the results of such audit shall
be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. If the parties do
not agree upon the inclusion or amount of any Operating Expense
charged by Landlord, the sole remedy of Tenant shall be to conduct
an audit within the time specified in this Lease and, if still in
disagreement with Landlord, to submit the matter to arbitration
within thirty (30) days after completion of the audit to request an
adjustment to any disputed Operating Expense item. In no event will
this Lease be terminable nor shall Landlord be liable for damages
based upon any disagreement regarding an adjustment of Operating
Expenses. Tenant agrees that the results of any Operating Expenses
audit shall be kept strictly confidential by Tenant and shall not
be disclosed to any other person or entity.


 


5.2  
Real Property
Taxes.


 


(a)   Landlord shall pay
the Real Property Taxes, as defined in Section 5.2(b), applicable
to the Project, subject to reimbursement by Tenant of
Tenant’s Share of increases in such Taxes in accordance with
the provisions of Section 5.1; provided, however, the Real Property
Taxes shall not be subject to the gross up described in said
Section 5.1.


 


(b)   “Real
Property Taxes” shall include any form of Real Property Tax
or assessment, general, special, or otherwise, and any license fee,
commercial rental tax, improvement bond or bonds, levy or tax
levied upon or with respect to the Building, the Project, and the
Land, imposed upon or with respect to the Building, the Project,
and the Land, imposed by Federal, State and/or local governments,
as well as school districts and/or other taxing authorities (but
shall not include income, franchise, capital stock, estate or
inheritance taxes or taxes based upon receipts of rentals, unless
the same be in substitution for or in lieu of a Real Property Tax
or assessment), and any personal property taxes imposed upon the
fixtures, machinery, equipment. apparatus, systems and
appurtenances in, upon or used in connection with the Building and
the Project for the operation thereof. However, if, because of any
change in the method of taxation of real property, any other or
additional tax or assessment is imposed upon Landlord or upon or
with respect to the Building, the Project, and/or the Land or the
rents or income therefrom, in addition to or in substitution for,
or in lieu of any tax or assessment which would otherwise be a Real
Property Tax, or personal property tax of the type referred to
above, such other tax or assessment shall also be deemed a Real
Property Tax. As used herein, the term “Real Property
Tax” shall be deemed to include “real estate
tax”.


 


(c)   Tenant shall pay
prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon
trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal
property of Tenant contained in the Premises or related to
Tenant’s use of the Premises. If any of Tenant’s
personal property shall be assessed with Landlord’s real
property, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the taxes attributable to
Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written statement
from Landlord setting forth the taxes applicable to Tenant’s
property.


 


(d)   From time to time
Landlord may challenge the assessed value of the Project as
determined by applicable taxing authorities and/or Landlord may
attempt to cause the Real Property Taxes to be reduced on other
grounds. If Landlord is successful in causing the Real Property
Taxes to be reduced or in obtaining a refund, rebate,

 


 



6





 


 
credit or
similar benefit (hereinafter collectively referred to as a
“reduction”), Landlord shall, to the extent
practicable, credit the reduction(s) to Real Property Taxes for the
calendar year to which a reduction applies and recalculate the
Expense Increases owed by Tenant for years after the year in which
the reduction applies based on the reduced Real Property Taxes (if
a reduction applies to Tenant’s Base Year, the Base Year
Expenses shall be reduced by the amount of the reduction and
Tenant’s Share of Expense Increases shall be recalculated for
all Comparison Years following the year of the reduction based on
the lower Base Year amount). All costs incurred by Landlord in
obtaining the Real Property Taxes reductions shall be considered an
Operating Expense and Landlord shall determine, in its sole
discretion to which years any reductions will be applied. In
addition, all accounting and related costs incurred by Landlord in
calculating new Base Years for tenants and in making all other
adjustments shall be an Operating Expense.

 


6.  
Security Deposit
. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord
at the time it executes this Lease the security deposit set forth
in Section 1.10 as security for Tenant’s faithful performance
of Tenant’s obligations hereunder. If Tenant fails to pay
Base Rent or other charges due hereunder, or otherwise defaults
with respect to any provision of this Lease, Landlord may use all
or any portion of said deposit for the payment of any Base Rent or
other charge due hereunder, to pay any other sum to which Landlord
may become obligated by reason of Tenant’s default, or to
compensate Landlord for any loss or damage which Landlord may
suffer thereby. If Landlord so uses or applies all or any portion
of said deposit, Tenant shall within ten (10) days after written
demand therefor deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient
to restore said deposit to its full amount. Landlord shall not be
required to keep said security deposit separate from its general
accounts. If Tenant performs all of Tenant’s obligations
hereunder, said deposit, or so much thereof as has not heretofore
been applied by Landlord, shall be returned, without payment of
interest or other amount for its use, to Tenant (or, at
Landlord’s option, to the last assignee, if any, of
Tenant’s interest hereunder) at the expiration of the Term
hereof, and after Tenant has vacated the Premises. No trust
relationship is created herein between Landlord and Tenant with
respect to said security deposit. Tenant acknowledges that the
security deposit is not an advance payment of any kind or a measure
of Landlord’s damages in the event of Tenant’s
default.


 


See Addendum Paragraph
2

 


7.  
Use.


 


7.1  
Use . The Premises shall be used and occupied only
for the purpose set forth in Section 1.5 and for no other purpose.
If Section 1.5 gives Tenant the right to use the Premises for
general office use, by way of example and not limitation, general
office use shall not include medical office use or any similar use,
laboratory use, classroom use, any use not characterized by
applicable zoning and land use restrictions as general office use,
or any use which would require Landlord or Tenant to obtain a
conditional use permit or variance from any federal, state or local
authority. No exclusive use has been granted to Tenant
hereunder.


 


7.2  
Compliance with Law
. Notwithstanding any permitted use
inserted in Section 1.5, Tenant shall not use the Premises for any
purpose which would violate the Project’s certificate of
occupancy, any conditional use permit or variance applicable to the
Project or violate any covenants, conditions or other restrictions
applicable to the Project. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense,
promptly comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules,
regulations, orders, certificates of occupancy, conditional use
permits, variances, covenants and restrictions of record, and
requirements of any fire insurance underwriters, rating bureaus or
government agencies, now in effect or which may hereafter come into
effect, whether or not they reflect a change in policy from that
now existing, during the Term or any part of the Term hereof,
relating in any manner to the Premises and the occupation and use
by Tenant of the Premises. Tenant shall conduct its business and
use the Premises in a lawful manner and shall not use or permit the
use of the Premises or the Common Areas in any manner that will
tend to create waste or a nuisance or shall tend to disturb other
occupants of the Project. Tenant shall obtain, at its sole expense,
any permit or other governmental authorization required to operate
its business from the Premises. Landlord shall not be liable for
the failure of any other tenant or person to abide by the
requirements of this section or to otherwise comply with applicable
laws and regulations, and Tenant shall not be excused from the
performance of its obligations under this Lease due to such a
failure.


 


7.3  
Condition of Premises
. Except as otherwise provided in
this Lease, Tenant hereby accepts the Premises and the Project in
their condition existing as of the date this Lease is executed by
Landlord and Tenant, subject to all applicable federal, state and
local laws, ordinances, regulations and permits governing the use
of the Premises, the Project’s certificate of occupancy, any
applicable conditional use permits or variances, and any easements,
covenants or restrictions of record affecting the use of the
Premises or the Project. Tenant shall comply with all federal,
state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety
and health at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. Tenant
acknowledges that it has satisfied itself by its own independent
investigation that the Premises and the Project are suitable for
its intended use, and that neither Landlord nor Landlord’s
agents has made any representation or warranty as to the present or
future suitability of the Premises, or the Project for the conduct
of Tenant’s business.


 


8.  
Maintenance, Repairs and
Alterations.


 


8.1  
Landlord’s
Obligations . Landlord
shall keep the Project (excluding the interior of the Premises and
space leased to other occupants of the Project) in good condition
and repair. If plumbing pipes, electrical wiring, HVAC ducts or
vents within the Premises are in need of repair, Tenant shall
immediately notify Landlord, and Landlord shall cause the repairs
to be completed within a reasonable time, the cost of which shall
be considered an Operating Expense and reimbursed in accordance
with Section 5.1, unless the need for such repairs is due to the
negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, in which case Tenant
shall immediately pay the entire cost of the repairs to Landlord.
Except as provided in Section 10.3, there shall be no abatement of
rent or liability to Tenant on account of any injury or
interference with Tenant’s business with respect to any
improvements, alterations or repairs made by Landlord to the
Project or any part thereof. Tenant expressly waives the benefits
of any statute now or hereafter in effect which would otherwise
afford Tenant the right to make repairs at Landlord’s expense
or to terminate this Lease because of Landlord’s failure to
keep the Project in good order, condition and repair but only to
the extent the terms and provisions of any such statutes conflict
with the terms and provisions of this Lease.

8.2  
Tenant’s
Obligations.


 


(a)   Subject to the
requirements of Section 8.3, Tenant shall be responsible for
keeping the Premises in good condition and repair, at
Tenant’s sole expense. By way of example, and not limitation,
Tenant shall be responsible, at Tenant’s sole expense, for
repairing and/or replacing, carpet, marble, tile or other flooring,
paint, wall coverings, corridor and interior doors and door
hardware, any supplemental or dedicated HVAC systems serving the
Premises, telephone and computer equipment, interior glass, window
treatments, ceiling tiles, shelving, cabinets, millwork and other
tenant improvements. In addition, Tenant shall be responsible for
the installation, maintenance and repair of all telephone, computer
and related cabling from the telephone terminal room on the floor
on which the Premises is located to and throughout the Premises,
and Tenant shall be responsible for any loss, cost, damage,
liability and expense (including attorneys’ fees) arising out
of or related to the installation, maintenance, repair and
replacement of such cabling. If Tenant fails to keep the Premises
in good condition and repair, Landlord may, but shall not be
obligated to, following written notice to Tenant and the expiration
of a five (5) business day cure period (or such lesser period in
the event of an emergency), make any necessary repairs. If Landlord
makes such repairs, Landlord shall bill Tenant for the cost of the
repairs as Additional Rent, and said Additional Rent shall be
payable by Tenant within ten (10) business days.


 


(b)   Tenant is
responsible for the maintenance of the lighting fixtures in the
Premises. At the option of Tenant, Landlord agrees to sell to
Tenant, replacement parts for the lighting fixtures, including
lamps, ballasts, starters, lenses and grills used in the Premises.
In addition, if Landlord provides replacement part installation
and/or repair work, then in said event, Tenant shall pay Landlord
the cost of installation thereof.


 


(c)   On the last day of
the Term hereof, or on any sooner termination, Tenant shall
surrender the Premises to Landlord in the same condition as
received, ordinary wear and tear excepted, clean and free of debris
and Tenant’s personal property. Tenant shall repair any
damage to the Premises occasioned by the installation or removal of
Tenant’s trade fixtures, furnishings and equipment. Except as
otherwise stated in this Lease, Tenant shall leave the power
panels, electrical distribution systems, lighting fixtures, HVAC,
window coverings, wall coverings, carpets, wall paneling, ceilings
and plumbing at the Premises and in good operating condition.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary,
Tenant shall remove, at or prior to the expiration or termination
of this Lease, at its expense, all wiring and cabling installed at
the Premises which shall have been installed by Tenant or which
Landlord shall have installed pursuant to this Lease or at the
request of Tenant. Such wiring and cabling shall include but not be
limited to (i) wiring and cabling above the ceiling panels,
behind or within walls, and under or within floors,
(ii) wiring and cabling for voice, data, security or other
purposes, (iii) wiring and cabling installed pursuant to
Section 8.3 below, pursuant to any work letter agreement attached
to this Lease, or otherwise, and (iv) all related
installations, equipment and items whatsoever.


 


8.3  
Alterations and
Additions.


 


(a)   Tenant shall not,
without Landlord’s prior written consent, which may be given
or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion, make any
alterations, improvements, additions, utility installations or
repairs (hereinafter collectively referred to as
“Alteration(s)”) in, on or about the Premises or the
Project. Alterations shall include, but shall not be limited to,
the installation or alteration of security or fire protection
systems, communication systems, millwork, shelving, file retrieval
or storage systems, carpeting or other floor covering, window and
wall coverings, electrical distribution systems, lighting fixtures,
telephone or computer system wiring, HVAC and plumbing. At the
expiration of the Term, Landlord may require the removal of any
Alterations installed by Tenant and the restoration of the Premises
and the Project to their prior condition, at Tenant’s
expense; provided, however, to the extent Landlord’s consent
is required pursuant to this Section, at the written request of
Tenant, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant concurrently with
Landlord’s approval of such Alteration whether or not
Landlord will require Tenant to remove such Alteration at the end
of the Term. If a work letter agreement is entered into by Landlord
and Tenant, Tenant shall not be obligated to remove the tenant
improvements constructed in accordance with the work letter
agreement. If, as a result of any Alteration made by Tenant,
Landlord is obligated to comply with the Americans With
Disabilities Act or any other law or regulation and such compliance
requires Landlord to make any improvement or Alteration to any
portion of the Project, as a condition to Landlord’s consent,
Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to pay to Landlord
prior to the construction of any Alteration by Tenant, the entire
cost of any improvement or Alteration Landlord is obligated to
complete by such law or regulation. Should Landlord permit Tenant
to make its own Alterations, Tenant shall use only such contractor
as has been expressly approved by Landlord, and Landlord may
require Tenant to provide to Landlord, at Tenant’s sole cost
and expense, a lien and completion bond in an amount equal to one
and one-half times the estimated cost of such Alterations, to
insure Landlord against any liability for mechanic’s and
rnaterialmen’s liens and to insure completion of the work. In
addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a fee equal to six percent
(6%) of the cost of the Alterations to compensate Landlord for the
overhead and other costs it incurs in reviewing the plans for the
Alterations and in monitoring the construction of the Alterations.
Should Tenant make any Alterations without the prior approval of
Landlord, or use a contractor not expressly approved by Landlord,
Landlord may, at any time during the Term of this Lease, require
that Tenant remove all or part of the Alterations and return the
Premises to the condition it was in prior to the making of the
Alterations. In the event Tenant makes any Alterations, Tenant
agrees to obtain or cause its contractor to obtain, prior to the
commencement of any work, “builders all risk” insurance
in an amount approved by Landlord and workers compensation
insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
subsection (a), Tenant shall have the right to make cosmetic,
non-structural Alterations (i.e., only painting, carpeting, wall
papering costing less than Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) in
any one instance) to the Premises without obtaining
Landlord’s prior written consent, provided that such
Alterations are not visible from the exterior of the Premises and
that Tenant provides Landlord with prior written notice of its
intention to make such Alterations and that the Alterations are
otherwise performed by Tenant in accordance with this Section 8.3.
For purposes of the Lease, it shall be deemed reasonable for
Landlord: (x) to require Tenant to perform Alterations during
non-business hours if such Alterations will otherwise create
unreasonable noise, noxious fumes or otherwise unreasonably
interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the other tenants in the
Building, and (y) to require Tenant to perform Alterations in
accordance with a reasonable schedule approved by the manager of
the Building.


 



 



8





 



 


(b)   Any Alterations in
or about the Premises that Tenant shall desire to make shall be
presented to Landlord in written form, with plans and
specifications which are sufficiently detailed to obtain a building
permit. If Landlord consents to an Alteration, the consent shall be
deemed conditioned upon Tenant acquiring a building permit from the
applicable governmental agencies, furnishing a copy thereof to
Landlord prior to the commencement of the work, and compliance by
Tenant with all conditions of said permit in a prompt and
expeditious manner. Tenant shall provide Landlord with as-built
plans and specifications for any Alterations made to the
Premises.


 


(c)   Tenant shall pay,
when due, all claims for labor or materials furnished or alleged to
have been furnished to or for Tenant at or for use in the Premises,
which claims are or may be secured by any mechanic’s or
materialmen’s lien against the Premises or the Project, or
any interest therein. If Tenant shall, in good faith, contest the
validity of any such lien, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a
surety bond satisfactory to Landlord in an amount equal to such
contested lien claim or demand indemnifying Landlord against
liability arising out of such lien or claim. In addition, Landlord
may require Tenant to pay Landlord’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs in participating in such
action.


 


(d)   Tenant shall give
Landlord not less than ten (10) days’ advance written notice
prior to the commencement of any work in the Premises by Tenant,
and Landlord shall have the right to post notices of
non-responsibility in or on the Premises or the Project as provided
by law.


 


(e)   All Alterations
(whether or not such Alterations constitute trade fixtures of
Tenant) which may be made to the Premises by Tenant shall be made
and done in a good and workmanlike manner and with new materials
satisfactory to Landlord and shall be the property of Landlord and
remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises at the expiration
of the Lease Term, unless Landlord requires their removal pursuant
to Section 8.3(a). Subject to Section 57 below, Tenant’s
personal property and equipment, other than that which is affixed
to the Premises so that it cannot be removed without material
damage to the Premises or the Project, shall remain the property of
Tenant and may be removed by Tenant subject to the provisions of
Section 8.2(b).


 


8.4  
Failure of Tenant to Remove
Property . If this Lease
is terminated due to the expiration of its Term or otherwise, and
Tenant fails to remove its property as required by Section 8.2(c),
in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord under this
Lease, and subject to any other right or remedy Landlord may have
under applicable law, Landlord may remove any property of Tenant
from the Premises and store the same elsewhere at the expense and
risk of Tenant and at any time (before or after Landlord stores
said property), Landlord may sell any or all such property at
public or private sale, in such a manner and at such times and
places as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may deem proper,
without notice to or demand upon Tenant. Landlord shall apply the
proceeds of such sale: first, to the cost and expenses of the sale,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees actually incurred;
second, to the payment of the cost of or charges for storing any
such property; third, to the payment of any other sums of money
which may then or thereafter be due to Landlord from Tenant under
this Lease; and fourth, the balance, if any, to Tenant.


 


9.  
Insurance.


 


9.1  
Insurance-Tenant.


 


(a)   Tenant shall
obtain and keep in force during the Term of this Lease a commercial
general liability policy of insurance with coverages acceptable to
Landlord, in Landlord’s reasonable discretion, which by way
of example and not limitation, protects Tenant and Landlord (as an
additional insured) against claims for bodily injury, personal
injury and property damage based upon, involving or arising out of
the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and
all areas appurtenant thereto. Such insurance shall be on an
occurrence basis providing single limit coverage in an amount of
not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single
limit with an “Additional Insured-Managers and Landlords of
Premises Endorsement”. The policy shall not contain any
intra-insured exclusions as between insured persons or
organizations, but shall include coverage for liability assumed
under this Lease as an “insured contract” for the
performance of Tenant’s indemnity obligations under this
Lease.


 


(b)   Tenant will also
maintain “all risk” extended coverage property
insurance written on a one hundred percent (100%) replacement cost
basis on Tenant’s personal property, all tenant improvements
installed at the Premises by Landlord or Tenant, Tenant’s
trade fixtures and other property. Such policies shall provide
protection against any peril included within the classification
“fire and extended coverage,” against vandalism and
malicious mischief, theft, sprinkler leakage and flood damage. If
this Lease is terminated as the result of a casualty in accordance
with Section 10, the proceeds of said insurance attributable to the
replacement of all tenant improvements at the Premises shall be
paid to Landlord. If insurance proceeds are available to repair the
tenant improvements, Landlord shall be named as a loss-payee with
respect to all tenant improvements, alterations or betterments
covered by Tenant’s casualty insurance policies, and, at
Landlord’s option, all insurance proceeds Tenant is entitled
to receive to repair the tenant improvements shall be paid by the
insurance company directly to Landlord, with all remaining proceeds
being paid to Tenant. Landlord shall select the contractor to
repair and/or replace the tenant improvements, and Landlord shall
cause the tenant improvements to be repaired and/or replaced to the
extent insurance proceeds are available.


 


(c)   Tenant shall, at
all times during the Term hereof, maintain in effect workers’
compensation insurance as required by applicable law (with
employer’s liability insurance of not less than $1,000,000)
and business interruption and extra expense insurance satisfactory
to Landlord in its reasonable discretion. In addition, Tenant shall
maintain in effect during the Term hereof a policy of automobile
liability insurance with bodily injury limits of $500,000 per
person, $1,000,000 per accident, and $100,000 per accident for
property damage.


 


9.2  
Insurance-Landlord.


 



 



9





 



 


(a)   Landlord shall
obtain and keep in force a policy of comprehensive general
liability insurance with coverage against such risks and in such
amounts as Landlord deems advisable insuring Landlord against
liability arising out of the ownership, operation and management of
the Project.


 


(b)   Landlord shall
also obtain and keep in force during the Term of this Lease a
policy or policies of “all risk” insurance covering
loss or damage to the Project in the amount of not less than eighty
percent (80%) of the full replacement cost thereof, as determined
by Landlord from time to time. The terms and conditions of said
policies and the perils and risks covered thereby shall be
determined by Landlord, from time to time, in Landlord’s sole
discretion. In addition, at Landlord’s option, Landlord shall
obtain and keep in force, during the Term of this Lease, a policy
of rental interruption insurance, with loss payable to Landlord,
which insurance shall, at Landlord’s option, also cover all
Operating Expenses. Tenant will not be named as an additional
insured in any insurance policies carried by Landlord and shall
have no right to any proceeds therefrom. At Landlord’s
option, Landlord may obtain insurance coverages and/or bonds
related to the operation of the parking areas. At Landlord’s
option, Landlord may obtain coverage for flood and earthquake
damages. In addition, Landlord shall have the right to obtain such
additional insurance as is customarily carried by owners or
operators of other comparable office buildings in the geographical
area of the Project. The policies purchased by Landlord shall
contain such deductibles as Landlord may determine. In addition to
amounts payable by Tenant in accordance with Section 5, Tenant
shall pay any increase in the property insurance premiums for the
Project over what was payable immediately prior to the Commencement
Date to the extent the increase is specified by Landlord’s
insurance carrier as being caused by the nature of Tenant’s
occupancy or any act or omission of Tenant.


 


9.3  
Insurance Policies
. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord
copies of the insurance policies required under Section 9.1 within
fifteen (15) days prior to the Commencement Date of this Lease, and
Landlord shall have the right to approve the terms and conditions
of said policies. Tenant’s insurance policies shall not be
cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage or other
modification except after thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Landlord. Tenant shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewals
thereof. If Tenant provides certificates of insurance to evidence
the insurance required under this Lease, all such certificates
shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, shall
affirmatively demonstrate all coverage and requirements set forth
in this Lease, shall contain no disclaimers of coverage, and shall
include a firm and unconditional obligation to give to Landlord at
least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice prior to
cancellation or change in any coverage. Tenant’s insurance
policies shall be issued by insurance companies authorized to do
business in the state in which the Project is located, and said
companies shall maintain during the policy term a “General
Policyholders’ Rating” of at least “A” and
a financial rating of at least “Class X” (or such other
rating as may be required by any lender having a lien on the
Project), as set forth in the most recent edition of “Best
Insurance Reports.” All insurance obtained by Tenant shall be
primary to and not contributory with any similar insurance carried
by Landlord, whose insurance shall be considered excess insurance
only. Landlord, and at Landlord’s option, the holder of any
mortgage or deed of trust encumbering the Project and any person or
entity managing the Project on behalf of Landlord, shall be named
as an additional insured on all insurance policies Tenant is
obligated to obtain by Section 9.1 above. Tenant’s insurance
policies shall not include deductibles in excess of Five Thousand
Dollars ($5,000).


 


9.4  
Waiver of Subrogation
. Tenant and Landlord each hereby
release and relieve the other, and waive their entire right of
recovery against the other, for direct or consequential loss or
damage arising out of or incident to the perils covered by
insurance carried by such party (or required to be carried by such
party by this Lease) to the extent of the insurance proceeds
actually received, whether due to the negligence of Landlord or
Tenant or their agents, employees, contractors and/or invitees.
Landlord and Tenant shall each cause the insurance policies they
obtain in accordance with this Section 9 to provide that the
insurance company waives all right of recovery by subrogation
against either party in connection with any damage covered by any
policy.


 


9.5  
Coverage . Landlord makes no representation to Tenant
that the limits or forms of coverage specified above or approved by
Landlord are adequate to insure Tenant’s property or
Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, and the limits of any
insurance carried by Tenant shall not limit its obligations under
this Lease.


 


10.  
Damage or
Destruction.


 


10.1  
Effect of Damage or
Destruction . If all or
part of the Project is materially damaged (as defined in Section
10.2 below) by fire, earthquake, flood, explosion, the elements,
riot or any other casualty, Landlord shall have the right in its
sole and complete discretion to repair or to rebuild the Project or
to terminate this Lease. Landlord shall within ninety (90) days
after the occurrence of such damage notify Tenant in writing of
Landlord’s intention to repair or to rebuild or to terminate
this Lease. Tenant shall in no event be entitled to compensation or
damages on account of annoyance or inconvenience in making any
repairs, or on account of construction, or on account of
Landlord’s election to terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Landlord shall elect to rebuild or repair the
Project, but in good faith determines that the Project cannot be
rebuilt or repaired within two hundred seventy (270) days after the
date of the occurrence of the damage, without payment of overtime
or other premiums, and the damage to the Project has rendered the
Premises unusable, Landlord shall notify Tenant thereof in writing
at the time of Landlord’s election to rebuild or repair, and
Tenant shall thereafter have a period of fifteen (15) days within
which Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease, upon written notice
to Landlord. Tenant’s termination right described in the
preceding sentence shall not apply if the damage was caused by
Tenant’s negligence or willful misconduct. Failure of Tenant
to exercise said election within said fifteen (15) day period shall
constitute Tenant’s agreement to accept delivery of the
Premises under this Lease whenever tendered by Landlord, provided
Landlord thereafter pursues reconstruction or restoration
diligently to completion, subject to delays caused by Force Majeure
Events. If Landlord is unable to repair the Damage to the Premises
or the Project during such two hundred seventy (270) day period due
to Force Majeure Events, the two hundred seventy (270) day period
shall be extended by the period of delay caused by the Force
Majeure Events. Subject to Section 10.3 below, if Landlord or
Tenant terminates this Lease in accordance with this Section 10.1,
Tenant shall continue to pay all Base Rent and Operating Expense
increases and other amounts due hereunder which arise prior to the
date of termination.


 



 



10





 



 


10.2  
Definition of Material
Damage . The damage shall
be deemed material if, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, the
uninsured cost of repairing the damage will exceed Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000). If insurance proceeds are available to
Landlord in an amount which is sufficient to pay the entire cost of
repairing all of the damage to the Project, the damage shall be
deemed material if the cost of repairing the damage exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Damage to the Project shall
also be deemed material if (a) the Project cannot be repaired
to substantially the same condition it was in prior to the damage
due to laws or regulations in effect at the time the repairs will
be made, (b) the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust
encumbering the Project requires that insurance proceeds available
to repair the damage in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000) be applied to the repayment of the indebtedness secured
by the mortgage or the deed of trust, or (c) the damage occurs
during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term.


 


10.3  
Abatement of Rent
. If Landlord elects to repair
damage to the Project and all or part of the Premises will be
unusable or inaccessible to Tenant in the ordinary conduct of its
business until the damage is repaired, and the damage was not
caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or its
employees, agents, contractors or invitees, Tenant’s Base
Rent and Tenant’s Share of Operating Expense increases shall
be abated in proportion to the amount of the Premises which is
unusable or inaccessible to Tenant in the ordinary conduct of its
business until the repairs are completed.


 


10.4  
Tenant’s
Negligence . If such
damage or destruction occurs solely as a result of the negligence
or willful misconduct of Tenant or Tenant’s employees,
agents, or contractors, and the proceeds of insurance which are
actually received by Landlord are not sufficient to repair all of
the damage, Tenant shall pay, at Tenant’s sole cost and
expense, to Landlord upon demand, the difference between the cost
of repairing the damage and the insurance proceeds received by
Landlord.


 


10.5  
Tenant’s
Property . Landlord shall
not be required to repair any injury or damage to, or to make any
repairs or replacements of, any fixtures, furniture, equipment or
tenant improvements installed in the Premises (other than building
standard tenant improvements), and Tenant shall repair and restore
all such property at Tenant’s sole expense.


 


10.6  
Waiver . Landlord and Tenant hereby waive the
provisions of any statutes which relate to the termination of
leases when leased property is damaged or destroyed and agree that
such event shall be governed by the terms of this Lease.


 


11.  
Utilities.


 


11.1  
Services Provided by
Landlord . Subject to all
governmental rules, regulations and guidelines applicable thereto,
Landlord shall provide HVAC to the Premises for normal office use
during the times described in Section 11.4, subject to Section 11.2
below, reasonable amounts of electricity for normal office lighting
and fractional horsepower office machines, water in the Premises or
in the Common Areas for reasonable and normal drinking and lavatory
use, at Tenant’s expense (and not included in Base Rent),
replacement light bulbs and/or fluorescent tubes and ballasts for
standard overhead fixtures, and building standard janitorial
services in accordance with Exhibit D attached hereto. In addition,
Tenant shall be responsible for all costs (including the cost to
insure) associated with Tenant’s use and operation of any
dedicated or supplemental HVAC units and computer rooms. Subject to
the other terms and conditions of the Lease, Landlord shall provide
Tenant with reasonable access to the Common Areas of the Building,
including the use of at least one (1) elevator and access to the
Building by cardkey access, and to the Premises twenty-four (24)
hours a day, three hundred sixty-five (365) days per year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that
repairs, hazardous conditions and other circumstances beyond
Landlord’s control may prevent access to the Common Areas of
the Building and to the Premises from time to time.


 


11.2  
Electricity.


 


(a)   The Base Rent set
forth in this Lease does not include the cost of electricity
consumed by Tenant in the Premises; and Tenant shall, in addition
to the Base Rent, be required to pay an Electric Energy Charge as a
condition for the Landlord to provide electric current to the
Premises. The Electric Energy Charge shall be paid, as Additional
Rent, in equal monthly installments together with Base Rent,
commencing on the Commencement Date and throughout the Term and any
renewals or extensions thereof. As of the Commencement Date, the
Electric Energy Charge shall be measured by a check meter and
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, based on
Tenant’s actual usage of electricity for the
Premises.


 


(b)   (i) Landlord
shall have the right to estimate the annual cost of providing
electric current for the operation of the lighting fixtures and
electrical outlets initially installed in the Premises and Tenant
shall pay to one-twelfth (1/12th) of such estimated Electric Energy
Charge in advance in the same manner as Base Rent is paid
hereunder. Such Electric Energy Charge is subject to adjustment,
from time to time, based upon the actual checkmeter reading. In the
event the estimated Electric Energy Charge paid by Tenant is less
than the actual cost of electricity for the Premises as measured by
the checkmeter readings, Tenant shall pay the amount of such
underpayment to Landlord within five (5) business days following
Landlord’s invoice therefor. In the event the estimated
Electric Energy Charge paid by Tenant is greater than the actual
cost of electricity for the Premises as measured by the checkmeter
readings, Landlord shall credit the amount of such overpayment to
Tenant’s next installment of Electric Energy Charge coming
due under the Lease.


 


(ii)   For the purposes
hereof, energy adjustment charges, fuel adjustment charges, and any
other charge of, or factor upon which, the public utility company
supplying electricity fixes or determines charges or rates, shall
be deemed included in determining and computing the
“rate” or charges for such electric current. If any tax
or other charge is imposed upon Landlord’s receipt from the
sale or resale of electric energy to Tenant by any federal, state
or municipal authority, Tenant covenants and agrees that, where
permitted by law, Tenant’s pro rata share of such taxes or
other charges shall be passed on to and paid by Tenant to
Landlord.


 



 



11





 



 


(c)   it is understood
and agreed by Tenant that the Electric Energy Charge and any
adjustments thereto as described in this subsection 11.2 are based
on the use of electric current in the Premises during business
hours on business days.


 


(d)   Landlord shall not
in any way be responsible or liable to Tenant at any time for any
loss, damage or expense resulting from any change in the quantity
or character of the electric service or for its being no longer
suitable for Tenant’s requirements or from any cessation or
interruption of the supply or current; nor shall any such loss,
damage or expense, or non-supply of electric service or current in
any way affect the tenancy or in any way relieve Tenant of any
obligation under the terms of this Lease.


 


(e)   Tenant covenants
and agrees that at all times its use of electric current shall
never exceed the maximum capacity for the Premises. Tenant shall
make no changes, alterations, additions, substitutions
(“Changes”) to any risers, conduits, meters, panel
boxes, switch gear, wiring, or any other part of the electric
service without the express prior written consent of Landlord. Any
Changes requested by Tenant shall be sent in writing to Landlord;
and if, in the reasonable judgment of Landlord, such Changes will
not cause or create a dangerous or hazardous condition or damage or
injury to the Building, or entail excessive or unreasonable
alterations or repairs, or interfere with or disturb other tenants
or occupants and/or the electrical service then or thereafter to be
supplied to tenants or occupants, Landlord will, at the sole cost
and expense of Tenant, make such Changes. Tenant covenants and
agrees to pay Landlord for such costs and expenses as additional
rent, upon the rendition of a bill indicating the amount due
therefor.


 


(f)   (i) Landlord
reserves the right to terminate the furnishing of electricity to
the Premises at any time, upon no less than ninety (90) days’
written notice to the Tenant, in which event, Tenant shall make
immediate application directly to the utility company servicing the
Building for the Tenant’s entire separate supply of electric
current; and Landlord shall permit its risers, wires, conduits and
other electrical equipment, to the extent available and safely
capable, to be used for such purpose. In the event Landlord
terminates the furnishing of electricity to the Premises,
thereafter Tenant shall pay the utility company providing
electricity to the Premises directly and Tenant shall no longer be
obligated to reimburse Landlord for the cost of electricity
supplied to the Premises as provided herein. Any meters, and
additional risers, wires, conduits and equipment or connections
necessary to enable Tenant to obtain electric current directly from
such utility company shall be installed at Tenant’s sole cost
and expense if the termination of Landlord’s service is
legally required; otherwise, they shall be installed at
Landlord’s sole cost and expense, and in compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations and requirements of
insurance companies and fire underwriters.


 


(ii)   No alterations,
modifications or changes shall be made by the Tenant to any meters,
risers, conduits or other equipment or connections in the Building
in a manner which would cause damage to the Building or interfere
with the use, enjoyment, occupancy or possession of the Building by
Landlord and its other tenants. Rigid conduit only, or such other
type as may be specified by Landlord, will be allowed.


 


(iii)   Tenant’s
liability for the Electric Energy Charge provided for in this Lease
shall terminate as of the date of discontinuance by Landlord of the
supplying of electric current, but this Lease shall otherwise
remain in full force and effect. Unless required by law, however,
Landlord shall not discontinue furnishing electricity to the
Premises until after Tenant shall have commenced receiving its
electricity directly from the utility company unless Tenant shall
have failed to make such arrangements with due
diligence.


 


11.3  
Building Services on Non-Business
Days or Non-Business Hours.


 


(a)   Tenant
acknowledges that Landlord is only required to provide the Building
Services specified in Section 11.1 hereinabove only during Business
Hours on Business Days and in addition, access to electricity,
water and one (1) automatic elevator, during Non-Business Hours on
Non-Business Days as well.


 


(b)   Landlord shall use
its best efforts to provide HVAC to Tenant at times other than
those set forth above subject to (i) the payment by Tenant of
Landlord’s standard charge, as determined by Landlord from
time to time, in Landlord’s sole discretion, for after hours
HVAC and (ii) Tenant providing to Landlord at least one (1)
Business Day’s advance written notice of Tenant’s need
for Non-Business Hours and/or Non-Business Day HVAC service. As of
the date of this Lease, and subject to future increases, the
standard charge for after hours HVAC is Sixty-Five Dollars ($65.00)
per hour with a four (4) hour minimum if Tenant’s after hours
use of the HVAC is not continuous in any one (1) day. For purposes
hereof “continuous in any one (1) day” shall mean
uninterrupted weekday service (not including weekends and
holidays). For example, if Tenant requests after hours use of the
HVAC between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on a non-holiday Tuesday, then
the four (4) hour minimum shall not apply and Tenant shall be
charged for two (2) hours of after hours use of the HVAC.
Alternatively, if Tenant requests after hours use of the HVAC
between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. on a Sunday, Tenant shall be
charged for the minimum amount of four (4) hours of after hours use
of the HVAC. Tenant shall pay all after hours HVAC charges to
Landlord within fifteen (15) days after Landlord bills Tenant for
said charges.


 


11.4  
Definition of Business Days and
Business Hours of Building Services . “Business Days” as defined herein,
shall be Monday through Friday from 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 PM and
Saturdays from 8:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M., excluding all days observed
as non-working (vacation) holidays by the State and/or Federal
government (“Holidays”). “Business Hours”
as defined herein, shall mean 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. on Monday
through Friday, excluding Holidays, and Saturday, from 8:00 A.M. to
1:00 P.M., excluding Holidays.


 


11.5  
Excess Usage by Tenant
. Notwithstanding the use set forth
in Section 1.5 and/or Section 11 and its sub-sections, Tenant shall
not use Building utilities or services in excess of those used by
the average office building tenant using its premises for ordinary
office use. Tenant shall not install at the Premises office
machines, lighting fixtures or other equipment which will generate
above average heat, noise or vibration at the Premises or which
will adversely effect the temperature maintained by the HVAC
system. If Tenant does use Building utilities (i.e. electricity) or
services in excess of those used by the average office building
tenant, Landlord shall have the right, in addition to

 


 



12





 


 
any other
rights or remedies it may have under this Lease, to (a) at
Tenant’s expense, install separate metering devices at the
Premises, and to charge Tenant for its usage, (b) require
Tenant to pay to Landlord all costs, expenses and damages incurred
by Landlord as a result of such usage, and (c) require Tenant
to stop using excess utilities or services.

 


11.6  
Interruptions
. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall
not be liable to Tenant for its failure to furnish utilities or
other Building Services when such failure is occasioned, in whole
or in part, by repairs, replacements, or improvements, by any
strike, lockout or other labor trouble, by inability to secure
electricity, gas, water, or other fuel at the Project after
reasonable effort to do so, by any accident or casualty whatsoever,
by act or default of Tenant or other parties, or by any other cause
beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, and such failures shall
never be deemed to constitute an eviction or disturbance of
Tenant’s use and possession of the Premises or relieve Tenant
from paying rent or performing any of its obligations under this
Lease. Furthermore, Landlord shall not be liable under any
circumstances for loss of property or for injury to, or
interference with, Tenant’s business, including, without
limitation, loss of profits, however occurring, through or in
connection with or incidental to a failure to furnish any of the
Building Services or utilities as set forth in this Section 11 and
its sub-sections. Landlord may comply with voluntary controls or
guidelines promulgated by any governmental entity relating to the
use or conservation of energy, water, gas, light or electricity or
the reduction of automobile or other emissions without creating any
liability of Landlord to Tenant under this Lease.


 


11.7  
Services Exclusive to
Tenant . Subject to the
other provisions of this Section 11, Tenant shall pay for all
water, gas, heat, electricity, telephone and other utilities and
services supplied and/or metered or submetered exclusively to the
Premises or to Tenant, together with any taxes thereon.


 


12.  
Assignment and
Subletting.


 


12.1  
Landlord’s Consent
Required . Tenant shall
not voluntarily or by operation of law assign, transfer,
hypothecate, mortgage, sublet, or otherwise transfer or encumber
all or any part of Tenant’s interest in this Lease or in the
Premises (hereinafter collectively a “Transfer”),
without Landlord’s prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Landlord shall respond to
Tenant’s written request for consent hereunder within thirty
(30) days after Landlord’s receipt of the written request
from Tenant. Any attempted Transfer without such consent shall be
void and shall constitute a material default and breach of this
Lease. Tenant’s written request for Landlord’s consent
shall include, and Landlord’s thirty (30) day response period
referred to above shall not commence, unless and until Landlord has
received from Tenant, all of the following information:
(a) financial statements for the proposed assignee or
subtenant for the past two (2) years prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, (b) federal tax
returns for the proposed assignee or subtenant for the past two (2)
years, (c) a detailed description of the business the assignee
or subtenant intends to operate at the Premises, (d) the
proposed effective date of the assignment or sublease, (e) a
copy of the proposed sublease or assignment agreement which
includes all of the terms and conditions of the proposed assignment
or sublease, and (f) a detailed description of any ownership
or commercial relationship between Tenant and the proposed assignee
or subtenant. If the obligations of the proposed assignee or
subtenant will be guaranteed by any person or entity,
Tenant’s written request shall not be considered complete
until the information described in (a) and (b) of the previous
sentence has been provided with respect to each proposed guarantor.
“Transfer” shall also include the transfer (a) if
Tenant is a corporation, and Tenant’s stock is not publicly
traded over a recognized securities exchange, of more than twenty
five percent (25%) of the voting stock of such corporation during
the term of this Lease (whether or not in one or more transfers) or
the dissolution or merger of the corporation, or (b) if Tenant
is a partnership or other entity, of more than twenty five percent
(25%) of the profit and loss participation in such partnership or
entity during the term of this Lease (whether or not in one or more
transfers) or the dissolution or liquidation of the partnership. If
Tenant is a limited or general partnership (or is comprised of two
or more persons, individually or as co-partners), Tenant shall not
be entitled to change or convert to (i) a limited liability
company, (ii) a limited liability partnership or
(iii) any other entity which possesses the characteristics of
limited liability without the prior written consent of Landlord,
which consent may be given or withheld in Landlord’s sole
discretion. The involvement by Tenant or its assets in any
transaction, or series of transactions (by way of merger, sale,
acquisition, financing, refinancing, transfer, leveraged buy-out or
otherwise) whether or not a formal assignment or hypothecation of
this Lease or Tenant’s assets occurs, shall be considered to
be an assignment of this Lease by Tenant to which Landlord may
reasonably withhold its consent unless after such transaction or
series of transactions the surviving entity will have a net worth
at least equal to the net worth of the Tenant immediately preceding
the date of this Lease. Tenant’s sole remedy in the event
that Landlord shall wrongfully withhold consent to or disapprove
any assignment or sublease shall be to obtain an order by a court
of competent jurisdiction that Landlord grant such consent; in no
event shall Landlord be liable for damages with respect to its
granting or withholding consent to any proposed assignment or
sublease. If Landlord shall exercise any option to recapture the
Premises, or shall deny a request for consent to a proposed
assignment or sublease, Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and claims that may be made against Landlord by the
proposed assignee or subtenant, or by any brokers or other persons
claiming a commission or similar compensation in connection with
the proposed assignment or sublease.


 


12.2  
Standard for Approval
. Landlord shall not unreasonably
withhold its consent to a Transfer provided that Tenant has
complied with each and every requirement, term and condition of
this Section 12. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that each
requirement, term and condition in this Section 12 is a reasonable
requirement, term or condition. It shall be deemed reasonable for
Landlord to withhold its consent to a Transfer if any requirement,
term or condition of this Section 12 is not complied with or:
(a) the Transfer would cause Landlord to be in violation of
its obligations under another lease or agreement to which Landlord
is a party; (b) in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, a
proposed assignee or subtenant has a smaller net worth than Tenant
had on the date this Lease was entered into with Tenant or is less
able financially to pay the rents due under this Lease as and when
they are due and payable; (c) a proposed assignee’s or
subtenant’s business will impose a materially greater burden
on the Project’s parking facilities, elevators, Common Areas
or utilities that is greater than the burden imposed by Tenant, in
Landlord’s reasonable judgment; (d) the terms of a
proposed assignment or subletting will allow the proposed assignee
or subtenant to exercise a right of renewal, right of expansion,
right of first offer, right of first refusal or similar right held
by Tenant; (e) a proposed assignee or subtenant does not, in
Landlord’s reasonable judgment, have a good credit rating;
(f) a

 


 



13





 


 
proposed
assignee or subtenant refuses to enter into a written assignment
agreement or sublease, reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, which
provides that it will abide by and assume all of the terms and
conditions of this Lease for the term of any assignment or sublease
and containing such other terms and conditions as Landlord
reasonably deems necessary; (g) the use of the Premises by the
proposed assignee or subtenant will not be identical to the use
permitted by this Lease; (h) the proposed assignee or
subtenant is then currently a tenant of the Landlord at the
Project; (i) Landlord has ever evicted or been involved in
litigation with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (j) any
guarantor of this Lease refuses to consent to the Transfer or to
execute a written agreement reaffirming the guaranty;
(k) Tenant is in default as defined in Section 13.1 at the
time of the request; (l) if requested by Landlord, the
assignee or sublessee refuses to sign a non-disturbance and
attornment agreement in favor of Landlord’s lender;
(m) Landlord is marketing space in the Project at the time of
Tenant’s request, and the terms of a proposed assignment or
subletting will allow the proposed assignee or subtenant to pay a
base rent less than the prevailing base rent being charged new
tenants in the Building at the time of such Transfer; or
(n) the proposed assignee or subtenant is a person or entity
then, or during the prior six (6) months, negotiating with Landlord
for the lease of space in the Project.

 


12.3  
Additional Terms and
Conditions . The
following terms and conditions shall be applicable to any
Transfer:


 


(a)   Regardless of
Landlord’s consent, no Transfer shall release Tenant from
Tenant’s obligations hereunder or alter the primary liability
of Tenant to pay the rent and other sums due Landlord hereunder and
to perform all other obligations to be performed by Tenant
hereunder or release any guarantor from its obligations under its
guaranty.


 


(b)   Landlord may
accept rent from any person other than Tenant pending approval or
disapproval of an assignment or subletting.


 


(c)   Neither a delay in
the approval or disapproval of a Transfer, nor the acceptance of
rent, shall constitute a waiver or estoppel of Landlord’s
right to exercise its rights and remedies for the breach of any of
the terms or conditions of this Section 12.


 


(d)   The consent by
Landlord to any Transfer shall not constitute a consent to any
subsequent Transfer by Tenant or to any subsequent or successive
Transfer by an assignee or subtenant. However, Landlord may consent
to subsequent Transfers or any amendments or modifications thereto
without notifying Tenant or anyone else liable on the Lease and
without obtaining their consent, and such action shall not relieve
such persons from liability under this Lease.


 


(e)   In the event of
any default under this Lease, Landlord may proceed directly against
Tenant, any guarantors or anyone else responsible for the
performance of this Lease, including any subtenant or assignee,
without first exhausting Landlord’s remedies against any
other person or entity responsible therefor to Landlord, or any
security held by Landlord.


 


(f)   Landlord’s
written consent to any Transfer by Tenant shall not constitute an
acknowledgment that no default then exists under this Lease nor
shall such consent be deemed a waiver of any then existing
default.


 


(g)   The discovery of
the fact that any financial statement relied upon by Landlord in
giving its consent to an assignment or subletting was materially
false shall, at Landlord’s election, render Landlord’s
consent null and void.


 


(h)   Landlord shall not
be liable under this Lease or under any assignment or sublease to
any assignee or subtenant.


 


(i)   No assignment or
sublease may be modified or amended without Landlord’s prior
written consent.


 


(j)   Tenant or its
agent shall not advertise the Premises for lease, sublet or
assignment for less Rent than the then current asking rent for
space in the Project.


 


12.4  
Additional Terms and Conditions
Applicable to Subletting . The following terms and conditions shall apply
to any subletting by Tenant of all or any part of the Premises and
shall be deemed included in all subleases under this Lease whether
or not expressly incorporated therein:


 


(a)   Tenant hereby
absolutely and unconditionally assigns and transfers to Landlord
all of Tenant’s interest in all rentals and income arising
from any sublease entered into by Tenant, and Landlord may collect
such rent and income and apply same toward Tenant’s
obligations under this Lease; provided, however, that until a
default shall occur in the performance of Tenant’s
obligations under this Lease, Tenant may receive, collect and enjoy
the rents accruing under such sublease. Landlord shall not, by
reason of this or any other assignment of such rents to Landlord
nor by reason of the collection of the rents from a subtenant, be
deemed to have assumed or recognized any sublease or to be liable
to the subtenant for any failure of Tenant to perform and comply
with any of Tenant’s obligations to such subtenant under such
sublease, including, but not limited to, Tenant’s obligation
to return any security deposit. Tenant hereby irrevocably
authorizes and directs any such subtenant, upon receipt of a
written notice from Landlord stating that a default exists in the
performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, to pay
to Landlord the rents due as they become due under the sublease.
Tenant agrees that such subtenant shall have the right to rely upon
any such statement and request from Landlord, and that such
subtenant shall pay such rents to Landlord without any obligation
or right to inquire as to whether such default exists and
notwithstanding any notice from or claim from Tenant to the
contrary.


 


(b)   In the event
Tenant shall default in the performance of its obligations under
this Lease, Landlord at its option and without any obligation to do
so, may require any subtenant to attorn to Landlord, in which event
Landlord shall undertake the obligations of Tenant under such
sublease from the time of the exercise of said option to

the termination
of such sublease; provided, however, Landlord shall not be liable
for any prepaid rents or security deposit paid by such subtenant to
Tenant or for any other prior defaults of Tenant under such
sublease.

 


12.5  
Transfer Premium from Assignment
or Subletting . Landlord
shall be entitled to receive from Tenant (as and when received by
Tenant) as an item of additional rent fifty percent (50%) of all
amounts received by Tenant from such assignee or subtenant in
excess of the amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder (the
“Transfer Premium”). The Transfer Premium shall be
reduced by the reasonable brokerage commissions, market tenant
improvement costs and rental concessions, and reasonable legal fees
actually paid by Tenant in order to assign the Lease or to sublet a
portion of the Premises. “Transfer Premium” shall mean
all Base Rent, additional rent or other consideration of any type
whatsoever payable by the assignee or subtenant in excess of the
Base Rent and additional rent payable b

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
