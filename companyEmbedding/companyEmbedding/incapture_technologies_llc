Exec Breakfast Series: Using Data to Gain an Edge in Asset Management
San Francisco and New York City – July 14, 2016
Incapture Technologies (“Incapture”) sponsored a gathering of leading practitioners to explore how asset managers can harness new data sources, analytical tools, and technology platforms to drive performance in coming years. Organized and hosted by United Sales and Marketing Group (“USAM”), the event was held on July 14th at the Core Club in New York City.
The event featured a panel discussion moderated by Peter Knez, co-founder of Incapture. Peter enumerated the factors which have created conditions for profound disruption in asset management and highlighted why embracing “datafication” is essential for firms to gain and maintain an edge going forward.
Drew Kellerman, Managing Director of Business Development for Vertical Knowledge (“VK”), shared examples of how open source data can be curated to generate actionable insights that inform investment and trading decisions.
Braxton McKee, Founder and CEO of Ufora, highlighted the importance of instilling a disciplined engineering culture oriented towards building systems that are consistent, repeatable, and robust.
Larry Leibowitz, CEO of Incapture Technologies, illustrated how firms must adopt an open and flexible, platform driven approach to their technology stack in order to capitalize on these opportunities. This is especially true for firms who have built up a proliferation of vendor products over the years and lack the agility to quickly implement new technologies.
A highlight reel featuring key takeaways will be available at www.incapturetechnologies.com in the coming weeks.

Rapture available under open source license
San Francisco – Tuesday May 17, 2016
Incapture Technologies (“Incapture”) is excited to announce that the Rapture framework is now available as an open source offering. 
Rapture delivers a development environment and run-time for distributed enterprise applications. Developers interact with a consistent API accessible in various languages which abstracts a number of fundamental tasks including data management, cloud deployment, messaging, entitlements, and audit. 
Rapture is informed by decades of experience building and managing data driven applications for global asset management firms. The framework is equally suited for firms modernizing their existing environment or startups launching new offerings. 
In order to capitalize on the promise of new technology paradigms while responding to client and regulatory demands for increased transparency and operational resiliency, capital markets participants must adopt a new approach to technology architecture. Closed, monolithic applications tied together with bespoke integrations and manual workarounds will give way to open architectures with API based integrations to internal and third party data and services. Rapture provides the foundation to realize this vision. 
Releasing Rapture as open source is in line with an industry-wide movement towards open architectures. It also positions Rapture as a collaboration point amidst a burgeoning ecosystem of developers and vendors reshaping capital markets with new data sources, analytical tools, and applications.  
Rapture is available through the open source MIT license. Incapture offers support licenses which provide on-demand access to experienced support resources for teams building mission critical applications.

Data Lifecycle Manager for Regulatory Compliance
Compliance with regulatory mandates demands a fundamental re-think of how banks and asset managers approach data access, analysis, and governance. What is required? A flexible and open solution that promotes innovation while also providing operational controls. The Data Lifecycle Manager built on Rapture delivers on this ask.  
Fallout from the financial crisis continues as risk managers and IT professionals rush to implement solutions that address regulatory mandates. Banks and asset management firms must satisfy high level principles (the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting Principles) and specific asks (Volcker Rule and KYC/AML).
Data governance and operational transparency are consistent themes across these regulations, all driven by a motivation to bolster risk management capabilities. Manual workarounds and siloed systems that inhibit data sharing are rightly called out as areas of concern. A few changes on the margin to monolithic legacy systems will not be sufficient; general consensus is that a more fundamental re-think is needed: 
Ideally, banks need a single platform that can be automated for data accumulation and aggregation. And since data governance has taken on additional importance with the Volcker Rule, the platform needs to be robust enough to provide an audit trail for risk managers, auditors and regulators.
Many of the largest banks with over $50 billion in assets are building their own in-house systems. However, it is questionable how well those systems are integrated with existing systems at the firms. Even more questionable is how smaller firms will cope with the cost and complexity of new technology demands.
IT departments face the confounding challenge of responding to these regulations while remaining responsive to business users seeking to experiment with the latest cloud-based research and trading offerings. 
Incapture Technologies was founded by architects and developers with decades of experience delivering technology solutions for global asset managers. The challenges faced in those environments drove the development of Rapture, an open architecture framework.
By virtue of being built on Rapture, our products and solutions are flexible and adaptable while also offering a high degree of operational governance and controls. Some specific benefits that accrue to users include:

An automatically generated audit log of all system events
A robust entitlements framework that governs activity at the document level
Operational resiliency and scalability
Promotion of code through distinct research, testing, and production environments in service of a healthy SDLC
Transparency to underlying operations which makes troubleshooting easier
Open and modular architecture which promotes integration with legacy systems and adoption of new offerings
A robust SDK that supports continued enhancements 

These underlying benefits are crucial; a recent survey of global banks found that of the 11 Risk Data principles outlined by the Basel Committee, Data Architecture and IT Infrastructure and Adaptability (part of Data Aggregation) had the lowest compliance. Adding new features and tools to existing applications will not help firms respond to these asks; rather, a platform driven approach is required.
Incapture Technologies delivers Products and Solutions that enable clients to leverage and benefit from foundational aspects of the Rapture platform. One product offering particularly suited to addressing the regulatory requirements detailed earlier is the Data Lifecycle Manager which covers the full lifecycle of enterprise data:

Capture: Automate the collection, validation, transformation, and storage of inbound data, whether through batch processing or real-time event streams
Curate: Empower searching, locating, and retrieval of data by creating a data catalog of associated data descriptions
Search: Federated access to data through consistent references which abstract away underlying operational concerns
Distribute: Expose data and services to various consumers including commercial and open source data visualization and analysis tools

Having implemented Rapture as the underlying fabric for data management, firms can easily build extensions to address specific needs; for example, build and execute fully audited workflows that automate extraction of structured data from a variety of sources to meet client on-boarding requirements. Or, integrate risk management models and reporting tools to deliver a flexible and transparent regulatory reporting engine. In all cases, clients are prepared for the future by virtue of a robust underlying architecture that delivers flexibility and operational resiliency.
The Data Lifecycle Manager built on Rapture offers IT departments a unique path forward from their present challenges. We welcome questions and inquiries as to how Incapture can support your business needs at sales@incapturetechnologies.com.

Rapture: Taking advantage of the present while looking forward to the future
Incapture’s Rapture platform was born out of a desire to not repeat the past, to take advantage of the present and to look forward to the future. 
The Past
While working for a number of capital market banks and asset managers I had the opportunity to design, build and deploy a large number of different applications. Although the end functionality could often be vastly different some of the core components of the application stack were the same — in fact it was often deja vu in that I ended up rewriting (or recreating) the same functionality again and again. The enlightened among you would argue that this is a classic case of a need for a common platform or framework – something on which these applications could be built but in these organizations at this time the pressure was to deliver at any cost (time was of the essence) not to deliver a perfect and forward looking solution. This behavior, repeated over and over again, is often the source of the large legacy software infrastructure at these type of organizations and the challenge they now face to look forward.
The Present
The last two to three years have seen a fundamental shift in architectures for software applications — the advent of cloud computing, distributed systems, big data environments and the like have been instrumental in this change. These technologies were available before this time, it’s just that the market has matured to the point where such things are now commodity instead of esoteric.
The Future
In designing a platform to solve (or help transition) the problems of the past and to take advantage of the present we needed to ensure that the platform we design today does not become obsolete as new technologies and approaches emerge. We ensured that the platform has a pluggable model by default – it should be easy to replace one implementation with another. We also ensured that the API to our platform could be called by any language (the transport is open) with little effort. We cannot predict the new languages that will be created but we certainly should ensure that our platform can leverage those new languages with ease.
Where we are
In release Version 1 of Rapture we successfully captured these desires in a platform that can be used with new architectures around distributed processing and common access to data while still providing a legacy migration path for existing applications. The pluggable architecture and options around customizing and enhancing the core platform makes it easy for 3rd party developers to integrate their services and technology with our common platform. Finally and most importantly we have taken the core platform and extended it with key functionality in the Financial Services space – recreating nearly all of that common functionality that so frustrated me in my early career. If I had Rapture then I could have spent all of my time building key application functionality (Risk Analysis, Pricing, Trade Capture) instead of most of my time on managing data, processing, scheduling, entitlements, audit trails. I could have also delivered my applications via many different means – spreadsheet front ends, web front ends, thick clients – all calling the same common layer that delivers the business logic.

Rapture and REST

Published: 

					September 6, 2016					

Author: 

Jonathan Major



At Incapture we implemented a REST server to demonstrate exposing Rapture (Kernel) calls through a REST style interface. Specifically, to perform CRUD operations on the various Rapture data types: document, blob and series. This approach can be used when modeling and implementing your own Rapture client’s domain resources and interactions.
We wanted to use a simple and straightforward REST framework so we choose http://sparkjava.com/. This allows you to get started quickly and provides everything needed to build an API.
Lets focus on Rapture ‘Documents’. One of the prime uses of Rapture is to manage access to data. Rapture has the concept of a repository for managing access to data. Various repositories, configurations and implementations are provided ‘out of the box’. For the purposes of this post we will be considering a versioned document repository hosted on MongoDB.
Document data repositories manage data as key/value pairs and are addressable through URIs. In fact, all data in a Rapture system is uniquely addressable via a URI and is a key concept in using the platform.
For example, consider the following document with URI document://orders/ORD000023312  and data:

{
    "id" : "ORD000023312",
    "orderDate" : "20150616",
    "ordType" : "market",
    "side" : "buy",
    "quantity" : 4000000.0,
    "strategy" : "XYZ",
    "fund" : "FUNDNAME",
    "status" : "FILLED",
}



Lets look at the process to create a document repository and load a document.
The first step is spin up a local Rapture system; this can be done easily using Docker. The steps are set out at this README.md. All the docker images are available on Incapture’s public Dockerhub registry.
So lets begin the process of:

Creating a Document repository using a POST action
Adding a document using a POST action
Using GET action to retrieve the data
Deleting the document

A postman collection is available with working API calls. Please note this uses https://localhost as we’re using Docker’s native (mac) tools.  Postman collection includes a /login call and provides all the necessary body (Raw JSON/Application) inputs.

The first task is to create a versioned Document repository configured to use MongoDB.  The REST call is as follows:

    POST /doc/:authority
    Example: /doc/orders
    Body: {"config":"NREP USING MONGODB {prefix=\"orders\"}"}

The server will route this call and create this repository: document://orders
Here is the (spark) method implementing the route note the Rapture Kernel calls:


post("/doc/:authority", (req, res) -&gt; {
    log.info(req.body());
    String data = JacksonUtil.getMapFromJson(req.body());
    String authority = req.params(":authority");
    String config = (String) data.get("config");
    CallingContext ctx = getContext(req);
    if (Kernel.getDoc().docRepoExists(ctx, authority)) {
        halt(409, String.format("Repo [%s] already exists", authority));
    }
    Kernel.getDoc().createDocRepo(ctx, authority, config);
    return new RaptureURI(authority, Scheme.DOCUMENT).toString();
});


Next we will create a new ‘order’ document at URI document://orders/ORD000023312. The body for the call is provided in the postman collection.

   PUT /doc/:uri
   Example: /doc/orders/ORD000023312
   Body: {..order json here..}

Note the Rapture Kernel call to write a document putDoc(String uri, String body)

    put("/doc/*", (req, res) -&gt; {
     return Kernel.getDoc().putDoc(getContext(req), getDocUriParam(req), req.body());
    });

We won’t go through the subsequent GET and DELETE calls as the postman collection and github code are available to review.
