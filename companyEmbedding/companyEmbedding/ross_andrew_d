Winemaking Philosophy

Current Release

Vineyard Sources

Where to Find Our Wines





 




Short version:

Don’t mess up what the vineyards give us and keep the process interesting and lively.

Slightly longer version:

Too many people try to make wine into much more than it is and it ends up coming across as an intimidating and elitist pursuit.   Our goal is to go in the other direction:  keep it simple and make it fun.

At the end of the day, we’re talking about squished grapes.  But it’s the process the grapes follow from vineyard to bottle that is most important.  To start, we are blessed to have partnerships with the greatest growers in Washington State’s Columbia Valley and Columbia Gorge AVAs.  It’s these relationships that give us the best possible Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Pinot Gris.  We’re also learning how incredible Oregon’s Willamette Valley is for our Pinot Blanc dominant blend MEADOW.

In the winery, we treat the grapes with the attention and respect they deserve the minute they arrive.  Once the wines successfully complete fermentation, we make it our top priority to know what is happening in each and every barrel.  This allows us to craft world class, singularly distinctive, consistent wines for you to enjoy

Bottom line: we’re having a great time making delicious wines.

Where to Find Our Wines





 









2013 Red Mountain AVA Cabernet Sauvignon
								Our 2013 Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon represents a blend from three different vineyards:  Quintessence, Ciel du Cheval, and Klipsun.  The wine is a stunner and probably the most exciting wine I've put in bottle for this variety. 

AROMATICS
Impressive black fruit aromas bolstered by red currant, fresh cedar, and a hint of spice. 
PALATE
Balanced, rich Red Mountain plate. As it opens the wine takes on the subtle notes of a World Class Cabernet Sauvignon:  Black olive, mineral, and liquid Iron.

$30 per bottle (750mL)  



 








2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah
								2013 represents the 8th vintage working Dick Boushey and his famed Syrah site. We blend four different clones ranging in age from 11 to 22 years (representing the 2nd oldest planting in Washington State). We are thrilled to be able to source all the Syrah from this particular site.

Download Fact Sheet [PDF]

Aromatics
Floral and finesse driven Syrah.  Wonderful hints of orange peel and candied lavender. As the wine opens it takes on that tell-tale Boushey Syrah Funk.  Incredible.

Palate
Lush, juicy, and silky with smooth and refined tannins.  Great spice and energy. 

$30 per bottle (750 mL) 								



 








2015 Glaze Cabernet Sauvignon, Columbia Valley
								The 2015 Glaze is a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot and is fantastic.  This is your wine to pop mid-week when you just want something great, but don't want to think too much about it. We've sourced fruit from the central Columbia Valley as well as the Horse Heaven Hills to provide us with the best vineyards that will allow us to produce a wine of incredible quality at at a high level.  You need to have a case of this on hand at all times.

Download Fact Sheet [PDF] 

Aromatics
Cabernet and Merlot share the stage nicely with tell-tale Cabernet aromatics blending nicely with a touch of chocolate and orange peel.

Palate
Just enough structure to let you know this is Cabernet Sauvignon, but not so much that it needs time in the cellar.  Wonderful flavor and spice.

$15 per bottle (750 mL) 












2014 RA The Hutsman Cabernet Sauvignon
								The Huntsman Cabernet Sauvignon is a blend of 96% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Petit Verdot.  Our vineyard for this wine are a mix of Washington's finest AVAs:  Red Mountain, Horse Heaven Hills, and the Columbia Valley.  The Petit Verdot darkens the Cabernet Sauvignon just enough and adds incredible aromatics subtlety.  This wine is complex enough to be your Friday night starter or your daily drinker.

$17 per bottle (750mL) ($13 for Club Members)								



 








2016 Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris
Celilo Vineyard is a meticulously managed site rising high above the Columbia Gorge a few miles NW of Hood River, OR. It is arguably one of the greatest white grape sites in Washington with its cool climate, wonderfully mineral rich soil and high winds that move the 50" of annual rainfall off the canopy. 

Aromatics

The aromatics and palate of this wine really showcase what vine age can do to a wine. Asian pear, white flowers and nectarine. 

Palate

The palate is vibrant and crisp with a touch of minerals on the finish. A perfect food wine. 


$20 per bottle (750 mL)   












2012 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay
								Celilo vineyard has quickly become one of our favorite sources for White grapes. We've been working with their Pinot Gris since 2006 and are thrilled to have added Chardonnay from one of their oldest blocks to our portfolio. The wine has an incredibly rich aromatic profile with a palate that is all Celilo: bright, crisp and focused. 100 Cases produced. Yep, that's it.

$38 per bottle (750mL) - ($32 for Club Members)

Here's a very tasty Cabernet Sauvignon for everyday enjoyment with burgers, steaks, or just sharing with friends.  It's a blend of 80% Cabernet and 20% Merlot from selected Columbia Valley vineyards with just enough oak for roundness and extra interest.  Rich red currant and eucalyptus on the nose with grace notes of spice and mocha.  Juicy and rich on the palate, with currant and blackberry fruit, gentle oak, and sweet spice.  The ripe fruit and spice flavors carry through the easygoing finish where supple tannins provide support.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
