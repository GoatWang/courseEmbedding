JULY 21, 2003 

This prospectus describes information you should know before investing in the   
Lifetime Variable Select, an individual deferred variable annuity contract      
offered by TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company (TIAA-CREF Life) and funded through 
the TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 (the separate account). Before you     
invest, please read this prospectus carefully, along with the accompanying fund 
prospectus, and keep it for future reference.                                   

The contract is designed for individual investors who desire to accumulate funds
on a tax-deferred basis for retirement or other long-term investment purposes,  
and to receive future payment of those funds as lifetime income or through other
payment options. Whether the contract or certain investment options are         
available to you is subject to approval by regulatory authorities in your state.

You may allocate premiums to ten investment accounts which invest in the        
following funds of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds:                                    

- Growth Equity Fund                                                        
- Growth & Income Fund

- Stock Index Fund                                                          
- Social Choice Equity Fund                                                 
- Real Estate Securities Fund                                               
- Bond Fund                                                                 
- Money Market Fund                                                         

As with all variable annuities, your accumulations in your contract can increase
or decrease, depending on how well the investment account's mutual fund         
investment performs over time. TIAA-CREF Life doesn't guarantee the investment  
performance of the funds or the investment accounts, and you bear the entire    
investment risk.                                                                

More information about the separate account and the contract is on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a "Statement of Additional
Information" (SAI) dated July 21, 2003. You can receive a free SAI by writing us
at TIAA-CREF Life, 730 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017-3206 (attention:  
Central Services), or by calling 800 842-2733, extension 5509. The SAI is       
"incorporated by reference" into the prospectus; that means it's legally part of
the prospectus. The SAI's table of contents is on the last page of this         
prospectus. The SEC maintains a Website (www.sec.gov) that contains the SAI,    
material incorporated by reference and other information regarding the separate 
account.                                                                        

The SEC has not approved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the     
adequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal   
offense.                                                                        

An investment in the contract is not a deposit of the TIAA-CREF Trust Company,  
FSB, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance          
Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

SUMMARY 

Read this summary together with the detailed information you'll find in the rest
of the prospectus.                                                              

WHAT IS THE LIFETIME VARIABLE SELECT?                                           

Lifetime Variable Select is a variable annuity product that allows individual   
investors to accumulate funds on a tax-deferred basis for retirement or other   
long-term investment purposes, and to receive future payment based on the       
amounts accumulated as lifetime income or through other payment options.        

Under the Lifetime Variable Select contract, you may allocate your premiums     
among ten investment accounts of a TIAA-CREF Life separate account that invests 
in the following funds of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds:                             

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                                  
- Growth Equity Fund                 - Stock Index Fund           
- Growth & Income Fund               - Social Choice Equity Fund  
- International Equity Fund          - Real Estate Securities Fund
- Large-Cap Value Fund               - Bond Fund                  
- Small-Cap Equity Fund              - Money Market Fund          

As with all variable annuities, your accumulation in your contract can increase 
or decrease, depending on how well the fund underlying the investment account   
performs over time. TIAA-CREF Life doesn't guarantee the investment performance 
of the funds or the investment accounts, and you bear the entire investment     
risk.                                                                           

The contract accepts only after-tax dollars, which means your premiums can't be 
excluded from your gross income for tax purposes. However, earnings on your     
accumulations in the separate account aren't taxed until withdrawn or paid as   
annuity income. Withdrawals of accumulated investment earnings are taxable as   
ordinary income.                                                                

The contract is available to you provided it has been approved by the insurance 
department of your state of residence. Approvals are pending in certain         
jurisdictions.

There is no charge for the first 24 transfers in a contract year. We currently
do not, but may in the future, charge a $25 fee on all subsequent transfers.  

The next tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay periodically   
during the time that you own the contract, not including fund fees and expenses.

We impose the annual maintenance fee on every anniversary of your contract and
on surrender. The annual maintenance fee is waived if your contract           
accumulations exceed $25,000 on the anniversary date of your contract or the  
date of surrender.

TIAA-CREF Life has waived 0.60% of the mortality and expense risk charge, so

Because Teachers Advisors, Inc. (Advisors), the investment manager of the   
TIAA-CREF Life Funds, is responsible for providing or obtaining at its own  
expense all services necessary to operate the TIAA-CREF Life Funds on a     
day-to-day basis, these expenses are included in the management fee.        

(6)                                                                             
If TIAA-CREF Life imposed the full amount of the administrative expense,    
mortality and expense risk charges, total annual separate account and fund  
expenses would be 1.45% for the Growth Equity Fund, 1.43% for the Growth &  
 Income Fund, 1.49% for the International Equity Fund, 1.44% for the Large-Cap
Value Fund, 1.30% for the Small-Cap Equity Fund, 1.26% for the Stock Index  
Fund, 1.27% for the Social Choice Equity Fund, 1.45% for the Real Estate    
  Securities Fund, 1.30% for the Bond Fund, and 1.26% for the Money Market Fund.

Fund expenses are deducted from each underlying fund before TIAA-CREF Life is   
provided with the fund's daily net asset value. TIAA-CREF Life then deducts     
separate account charges from the net asset value of the corresponding          
investment account.                                                             

EXAMPLES                                                                        

The next two tables provide examples that are intended to help you compare the  
cost of investing in the contract with the cost of investing in other variable  
annuity contracts. These costs include contractowner transaction expenses,      
separate account annual expenses, and fund fees and expenses.                   

These examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the specified investment option
for the time periods indicated and that your investment has a 5% return each    
year. The examples also assume that the full annual contract maintenance fee is 
charged.

The first example assumes that the current separate account fee waivers are in  
place for each period. The second example assumes that there is no waiver of    
separate account charges.

your costs would be:

These tables are provided to help you understand the various expenses you would 
bear directly or indirectly as an owner of a contract. Remember that they don't 
represent actual past or future expenses or investment performance. Actual      
expenses may be higher or lower. For more information, see "Charges," page 18.  

HOW DO I PURCHASE A CONTRACT?                                                   

To purchase a contract, you must complete an application and make an initial    
payment of at least $2,500. Additional contributions, including under an        
automatic investment plan using

Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT), must be at least $50. For details, see        
"Purchasing a Contract and Remitting Premiums," page 13.                        

CAN I CANCEL MY CONTRACT?                                                       

You can examine the contract and return it to TIAA-CREF Life for a refund, until
the end of the "free look" period specified in your contract (which is a minimum
of 10 days, but varies by state). In states that permit it, we'll refund the    
accumulation value calculated on the date that you returned the contract and the
refund request to us. (Note that the value of your initial premium may have gone
down during the period.) In states that don't allow us to refund accumulation   
value only, we'll refund the premiums you paid to the contract. We will consider
the contract returned on the date it's postmarked and properly addressed with   
postage pre-paid or, if it's not postmarked, on the day we receive it. We will  
send you the refund within 7 days after we get written notice of cancellation   
and the returned contract. If you live in a state that requires refund of       
premiums, your total of premiums and transfers allocated to any investment      
account, other than the Money Market Account, during the "free look" period     
can't exceed $10,000. For details, see "Purchasing a Contract and Remitting
Premiums," page 13.                                                             

CAN I TRANSFER AMONG THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS OR MAKE CASH WITHDRAWALS FROM THE   
CONTRACT?                                                                       

Currently, you can transfer funds among the investment account options as often 
as you like (except from the International Equity Account, as described below). 
You may not, however, make more than two transfers from the International Equity
Account in any 90-day period. We also will not accept electronic transfers into 
or out of the International Equity Account between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.      
Eastern Time on business days. All those transfer requests will be rejected. (We
may impose further restrictions in the future, or take other steps to discourage
market timing.) All transfers must be for at least $250 or your entire contract 
accumulation. All cash withdrawals must be for at least $1,000 or your entire   
contract accumulation. For details, see page 17.                                

CASH WITHDRAWALS MAY BE TAXED AND YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY A TAX PENALTY IF YOU TAKE 
A CASH WITHDRAWAL BEFORE AGE 59 1/2.                                            
WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS FOR RECEIVING ANNUITY PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT?          

Variable annuity payments are available under the contract. Variable annuity    
payments increase or decrease, depending on how well the funds underlying the   
investment accounts perform over time. Your payments will also change depending 
on the income change method you choose--i.e., whether you choose to have your   
payments revalued monthly or annually.                                          

The contract offers a variety of annuity options, including: One-Life Annuities,
which pay income as long as the annuitant lives or until the end of a specified 
guaranteed period, whichever is longer; Fixed-Period Annuities, which pay income
for a period of between 2 and 30 years; and Two-Life Annuities, which pay income
as long as the annuitant lives, then continues at either the same or a reduced  
level for the life of the second annuitant or until

"The Contract--the Annuity Period," page 20.                                    

WHAT DEATH BENEFITS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT?                           

If you die before receiving annuity payments, your beneficiary can receive a    
death benefit. The amount of the death benefit will be the greater of the       
amounts you've accumulated in your accounts or the total premiums paid under    
your contract ("adjusted" for any cash withdrawals). For details, see "Death
Benefits," page 23.                                                             

TIAA-CREF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND TIAA 
The contracts are issued by TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, a stock life      
insurance company organized under the laws of the State of New York on November
20, 1996. All of the stock of TIAA-CREF Life is held by TIAA-CREF Enterprises,  
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of
America (TIAA). TIAA-CREF Life's headquarters are at 730 Third Avenue, New York,
New York 10017-3206.                                                            

TIAA is a stock life insurance company, organized under the laws of the State of
New York. It was founded on March 4, 1918, by the Carnegie Foundation for the   
Advancement of Teaching. TIAA is the companion organization of the College      
Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), the first company in the United States to issue
a variable annuity. CREF is a nonprofit membership corporation established in   
the State of New York in 1952. Together, TIAA and CREF, serving approximately   
2.5 million people, form the principal retirement system for the nation's       
education and research communities and one of the largest retirement systems in 
the world, based on assets under management. As of December 31, 2002, TIAA's    
assets were approximately $141.8 billion; the combined assets for TIAA and CREF 
totaled approximately $255.6 billion (although neither TIAA nor CREF stands     
behind TIAA-CREF Life's guarantees).                                            

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

On July 27, 1998, TIAA-CREF Life established TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account    
VA-1 as a separate investment account under New York law. The separate account  
is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. As    
part of TIAA-CREF Life, the separate account is also subject to regulation by   
the State of New York Insurance Department (NYID) and the insurance departments 
of some other jurisdictions in which the contracts are offered (see the SAI).   

Although TIAA-CREF Life owns the assets of the separate account, and the        
obligations under the contracts are obligations of TIAA-CREF Life, the separate 
account's income, investment gains, and investment losses are credited to or    
charged against the assets of the separate account without regard to TIAA-CREF  
Life's other income, gains, or losses. Under New York law, we can't charge the  
separate account with liabilities incurred by any other TIAA-CREF Life separate 
account or other business activity TIAA-CREF Life may undertake.

The investment objective, techniques and restrictions of the TIAA-CREF Life     
Funds, including the "Dual Investment Management Strategy," the "Quantitative   
Management Strategy," and the risks of investing in the funds are described     
fully in its prospectus and SAI. A copy of the prospectus or a profile of that  
prospectus accompanies this prospectus. The prospectus and SAI of the TIAA-CREF 
Life Funds may be obtained by writing TIAA-CREF Life Funds, 730 Third Avenue,   
New York, New York 10017-3206, by calling 800 842-2733, extension 5509, or by

prospectus for the TIAA-CREF Life Funds carefully before investing in the

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT                                                           

Teachers Advisors, Inc. (Advisors), an indirect subsidiary of TIAA, manages the 
assets of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. Advisors also manages the Stock Index       
Account of the TIAA Separate Account VA-1, TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds, and TIAA-CREF
Institutional Mutual Funds. The same personnel also manage the CREF accounts on 
behalf of TIAA-CREF Investment Management, LLC, an investment adviser which is  
also a TIAA subsidiary.                                                         

VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   

The separate account is the legal owner of the shares of the funds of the       
TIAA-CREF Life Funds offered through your contract. It therefore has the right  
to vote its shares at any meeting of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds' shareholders.    
TIAA-CREF Life Funds doesn't plan to hold annual meetings of shareholders.      
However, if and when shareholder meetings are held, we will give you the right  
to instruct us how to vote the shares attributable to your contract. If we don't
receive timely instructions, your shares will be voted by TIAA-CREF Life in the 
same proportion as the voting instructions received on all outstanding          
contracts. TIAA-CREF Life may vote the shares of the funds in its own right in  
some cases, if it determines that it may legally do so.                         

The number of fund shares attributable to you is determined by dividing your    
interest in the applicable investment account by the net asset value of the     
underlying fund.                                                                

ADDING AND CLOSING ACCOUNTS OR SUBSTITUTING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS; ADDING OR    
DELETING INCOME METHODS 

We can add new investment accounts in the future that would invest in other fund
portfolios or other funds. We don't guarantee that the separate account, any    
existing investment account or any investment account added in the future, will 
always be available. We reserve the right

to add or close accounts, substitute one investment portfolio for another with  
the same or different fees and charges, combine accounts or investment          
portfolios, or add, delete or stop providing income options from any investment 
account. We can also stop or start providing income-paying annuities under      
either the annual or monthly income change method from any current or future    
investment account. We can also make any changes to the separate account or to  
the contract required by applicable laws relating to annuities or otherwise.    
TIAA-CREF Life can make these and some other changes at its discretion, subject 
to NYID and SEC approval as required. The separate account can (i) operate under
the 1940 Act as an investment company, or in any other form permitted by law,   
(ii) deregister under the 1940 Act if registration is no longer required, or    
(iii) combine with other separate accounts. As permitted by law, TIAA-CREF Life 
may transfer the separate account assets to another separate account or account 
of TIAA-CREF Life or another insurance company or transfer the contract to      
another insurance company.                                                      

THE CONTRACT-THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD                                            

The contract is an individual flexible-premium (you can contribute varying      
amounts) deferred annuity that accepts only after-tax dollars. The rights and   
benefits of the contract are summarized below. However, the descriptions you    
read here are qualified entirely by the contract itself. We plan on offering the
contract in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the United States    
Virgin Islands, although currently the contract will not be available to        
residents in those states where we haven't yet received regulatory approval.    

PURCHASING A CONTRACT AND REMITTING PREMIUMS 

INITIAL PREMIUMS. We'll issue you a contract as soon as we receive your         
completed application and your initial premium at our home office. Initial      
premiums must be for at least $2,500. Please send your check, payable to        
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, along with the application to:                

TIAA-CREF

Note that we cannot accept money orders, travelers checks, or cash. In addition,
we will not accept a third-party check where the relationship of the payor to   
the account owner cannot be identified from the face of the check. We will      
credit your initial premium within two business days after we receive all       
necessary information or the premium itself, whichever is later. If we don't    
have the necessary information within five business days, we'll return your     
initial premium unless you instruct us otherwise upon being contacted.          

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASING A NEW CONTRACT

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering      
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions, including us, to   
obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an  
account. What this means is that when you purchase your contract, we will ask   
for your name, address, date of birth, social security

number and other information that will allow us to identify you, such as your   
home telephone number. Until you provide the information we need, we may not be 
able to open an account or effect any transactions for you.                     

ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS. Subsequent premiums must be for at least $50. We reserve   
the right to limit premiums to no more than $1,000,000 a year. Send a check,    
payable to TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, along with a personalized payment  
coupon (supplied upon purchasing a contract) to:                                

TIAA-CREF                                                                   
Personal Annuity Premiums                                                   
P.O. Box 530195

If you don't have a coupon, use a separate piece of paper to give us your name, 
address and contract number. These premiums will be credited as of the business 
day we receive them, and allocated in the same way as your prior premiums,      
unless you instruct otherwise. Currently, TIAA-CREF Life will accept premiums at
any time both the contractowner and the annuitant are living and your contract  
is in the accumulation period. However, we reserve the right not to accept      
premiums under this contract after you have been given three months' notice.    

ELECTRONIC PAYMENT. You may make initial or subsequent investments by electronic
payment. You may also establish an automatic investment plan using Electronic   
Funds Transfers (EFT) by completing an authorization form. A federal wire is    
usually received the same day and an ACH is usually received by the second day  
after transmission. Be aware that your bank may charge you a fee to wire funds, 
although ACH is usually less expensive than a federal wire. Here's what you need
to do:

INTERNET TRANSACTIONS. If your state allows, you may complete and send us an

electronic payment. Please visit the TIAA-CREF Web Center at www.tiaa-cref.org

CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. You may only open one contract in any calendar year.      
Except as otherwise described in this prospectus, the contract doesn't restrict 
how large your premiums are or how often you send them, although we reserve the

In addition, the total amount of premiums we accept from any financial advisory

We reserve the right to reject any premium payment or to place dollar

including federal laws designed to counter terrorism and prevent money          
laundering, we may be required to reject a premium payment. We may also be      
required to block a contractowner's account and refuse to pay any request for   
transfers, withdrawals, surrenders, or death benefits, until instructions are   
received from the appropriate regulator. We may also be required to provide     
additional information about you and your contract to government regulators.

ACCUMULATION UNITS                                                              

The premiums you allocate or transfers you make to the investment accounts      
purchase accumulation units. We calculate how many accumulation units to credit 
by dividing the amount allocated or transferred to the particular investment    
account by its accumulation unit value calculated at the close of the business  
day when we received your premium or completed transfer request. We may use a   
later business day for your initial premium. To determine how many accumulation 
units to subtract for transfers out and cash withdrawals, we use the unit value 
for the business day when we receive your completed transaction request and all 
required information and documents (unless you've chosen a later date).         

The value of the accumulation units will depend mainly on the investment        
experience of the underlying investment fund, though the unit value reflects    
expense deductions from assets by TIAA-CREF Life. We calculate the unit value at
the close of each valuation day. We multiply the previous day's unit value by   
the net investment factor for the pertinent investment account of the separate  
account. The net investment factor reflects, for the most part, changes in the  
net asset value of the shares of the fund held by the investment account, and   
investment income and capital gains distributed to the investment account. The  
net investment factor is decreased by the separate account expense and risk     
charges.                                                                        

TRANSFERS 

You can transfer some (at least $250 at a time) or all of the amount you        
accumulate under your contract among the separate account's investment accounts.
Currently, we don't charge you for transfers or limit the number of transfers   
you may make among the investment account options (except from the International
Equity Account, as described below). We reserve the right to limit transfers to 
twelve per year. In addition, if you make 25 or more transfers in any year, we  
reserve the right to impose a charge of $25 per transfer.                       

CERTAIN TRANSFER LIMITATIONS                                                    

-  You may not make more than two transfers from the International Equity       
   Account in any 90-day period. We reserve the right to further limit transfers
from any of the investment accounts in the future to as little as one     
transfer every 90 days.                                                   

-  We will not accept electronic transfers (i.e., over the Internet, by         
  telephone or by fax) into or out of the International Equity Account between
2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on business days. All those transfer 
requests will be rejected. (We will, however, give you the option of      
re-submitting the request to be effective on a later business day.)       
Similarly, any instructions to change or cancel a previously submitted    
 request will be rejected if those instructions are submitted electronically
  after 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. If the close of trading on the NYSE is earlier
  than 2:30 p.m., the restrictions on these electronic transactions will begin
at the market close.                                                      

MARKET TIMING                                                                   

There are contractowners who may try to profit from transferring money back and 
forth among investment accounts in an effort to "time" the market. As money is  
shifted in and out

of these accounts, we incur transaction costs and the underlying funds incur    
expenses for buying and selling securities. These costs are borne by all        
contractowners, including long-term investors who do not generate the costs. To 
discourage this market-timing activity, we could, in addition to imposing       
restrictions on the number of transfers allowed in a given period, among other  
things, limit a contractowner's ability to make transfers by telephone, fax or  
over the Internet. After appropriate notice, we may also stop doing business    
with financial advisors who engage in excessive transfer activity on behalf of  
their clients.                                                                  

CASH WITHDRAWALS                                                                

You can withdraw some or all of your accumulation in the investment accounts.   
Cash withdrawals must be for at least $1,000 (or your entire accumulation, if   
less). Any withdrawal that would reduce your contract accumulations below $1,000
will be considered a request for a full surrender. We also reserve the right to 
cancel any contract where your total amount in the separate account falls below 
$1,000. There's no charge for cash withdrawals.                                 

If you withdraw your entire accumulation in the separate account, we'll cancel  
your contract and all of our obligations to you under the contract will end.    

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWALS AND DOLLAR COST AVERAGING                                

You may set up a program to make cash withdrawals or engage in dollar cost      
averaging automatically, subject to state regulatory approval. You may do so by 
specifying that we withdraw or transfer from an account accumulation any fixed  
number of accumulation units, dollar amount or percentage of accumulation, until
you tell us to stop the transactions or until your accumulation is exhausted.   
You must have total accumulations of at least $10,000 under your contract to    
start a program, and the program must be set up so that at least $100 is        
automatically withdrawn or transferred at a time. Your withdrawal and transfer  
transactions cannot begin earlier than seven days after we receive all your     
required forms, and you may not begin a program during the "free look" period.  
We reserve the right to suspend the systematic withdrawal and dollar cost       
averaging programs at any time. Systematic withdrawals will terminate if a      
transaction would cause the contract accumulation to fall below $1,000. Note    
that systematic withdrawals and dollar cost averaging does not assure or profit 
or protect against a loss in declining markets.                                 

WITHDRAWALS TO PAY ADVISORY FEES                                                

You can set up a program to have monies withdrawn directly from your contract   
accumulations to pay your financial advisor. You will be required to complete   
and return certain forms to effect these cash withdrawals, indicating how you   
want these monies to be withdrawn. Funds will be withdrawn from each of your    
accounts on a pro rata basis. THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE TREATED AS CASH WITHDRAWALS
FOR TAX PURPOSES. IF YOU ARE UNDER AGE 59 1/2 YOU WILL LIKELY INCUR A 10 PERCENT
FEDERAL TAX PENALTY ON EARNINGS IN ADDITION TO REGULAR INCOME TAX. YOU SHOULD   
DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PENALTY WITH A QUALIFIED TAX ADVISOR BEFORE      
AGREEING TO HAVE ADVISORY FEES DEDUCTED FROM YOUR CONTRACT. Before you set up   
this program, make sure you understand all the possible tax consequences. We    
reserve the right to determine which financial advisors are eligible for this   
type of fee arrangement.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ALL TRANSFERS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS                   

You can tell us how much you want to transfer or withdraw in dollars,           
accumulation units, or as a percentage of your accumulation.                    

Transfers and cash withdrawals are effective at the end of the business day we  
receive your request and any required information and documentation. Transfers  
and cash withdrawals made at any time other than during a business day will be  
effective at the close of the next business day. You can also defer the         
effective date of a transfer or cash withdrawal to a future business day        
acceptable to us.                                                               

To request a transfer, write to TIAA-CREF Life's home office, call our Automated
Telephone Service at 800 842-2252 (there is an option to speak with a live      
person, if you wish), or go to the TIAA-CREF Web Center's account access feature
at www.tiaa-cref.org. If you make a telephone or Internet transfer at any time  
other than during a business day, it will be effective at the close of the next 
business day. We can suspend or terminate your ability to transfer by telephone,
fax, or over the Internet at any time for any reason.                           

TAX ISSUES                                                                      

Make sure you understand the possible federal and other income tax consequences 
of transfers and cash withdrawals. Cash withdrawals are taxed at the rates for  
ordinary income--i.e., they are not treated as capital gains. Withdrawals before
age 59 1/2 may subject you to early-distribution taxes as well. For details, see
"Federal Income Taxes," page 24.                                                

CHARGES 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT CHARGES                                                        

We deduct charges each valuation day from the assets of each investment account 
for various services required to administer the separate account and the        
contracts and to cover certain insurance risks borne by TIAA-CREF Life. The     
contract allows for total separate account charges (i.e., administrative expense
and mortality and expense risk charges) of 1.20 percent of net assets of each   
investment account annually. TIAA-CREF Life has waived a portion of the         
mortality and expense risk charges so that current separate account charges are 
at an annual rate of 0.60 percent of net assets annually. While TIAA-CREF Life  
reserves the right to increase the separate account charges at any time (up to  
the 1.20 percent maximum), we will provide at least three months' notice before 
any raise.                                                                      

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CHARGE. This charge is for administration and operations,
such as allocating premiums and administering accumulations. The daily deduction
is equivalent to 0.20 percent of net assets annually.                           

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE. TIAA-CREF Life imposes a daily charge as     
compensation for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with 
the contract. The current daily deduction is equal to 0.40 percent of net assets
annually.

TIAA-CREF Life's mortality risks come from its obligations under the contracts  
to make annuity payments under the One-Life Annuity and the Two-Life Annuity and
to pay death benefits before the annuity starting date. TIAA-CREF Life assumes  
the risk of making annuity payments regardless of how long the annuitant(s) may 
live or whether the mortality experience of annuitants as a group is better than
expected. TIAA-CREF Life also bears a risk in connection with its death benefit 
guarantee, since a death benefit may be more than the actual amount of an       
accumulation at the time when we receive proof of death.                        

TIAA-CREF Life's expense risk is the possibility that TIAA-CREF Life's actual   
expenses for administering and marketing the contract and for operating the     
separate account will be higher than the amount recovered through the           
administrative expense deduction.                                               

If the mortality and expense risk charge allowed under the contract isn't enough
to cover TIAA-CREF Life's costs, TIAA-CREF Life will absorb the deficit. On the 
other hand, if the charge more than covers costs, TIAA-CREF Life will profit.   
TIAA-CREF Life will pay a fee from its general account assets, which may include
amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charge, to Teachers Personal
Investors Services, Inc. (TPIS), the principal distributor of the contract.     

OTHER CHARGES AND EXPENSES                                                      

FUND EXPENSES. Certain deductions and expenses of the underlying funds are paid 
out of the assets of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. These expenses include charges   
for investment advice, portfolio accounting, custody, and similar services      
provided for the fund. Advisors is entitled to an annual fee based on a         
percentage of the average daily net assets of each fund, under an investment    
management agreement between Advisors and the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. The fund    
fees are as follows:

NO DEDUCTIONS FROM PREMIUMS. The contract provides for no front-end charges.    

PREMIUM TAXES. Currently, residents of several states may be subject to premium 
taxes on their contract. We normally will deduct any charges for premium taxes  
from your accumulation when it's applied to provide annuity payments. However,  
if a jurisdiction requires that premium taxes be paid at other times, such as   
when premiums are paid or when cash withdrawals are taken, we'll deduct premium 
taxes then. State premium taxes currently range from 1.00 percent to 3.50       
percent of premium payments.                                                    

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE. Your contract will be subject to an annual maintenance  
fee of $25, which will be assessed on every annual anniversary of your contract 
and on surrender of your contract. We will waive the annual maintenance fee if  
your contract accumulations exceed $25,000 on the anniversary date of your      
contract or the day you surrender your contract.                                

THE CONTRACT--THE ANNUITY PERIOD 

You can apply your contract accumulations to provide you with variable annuity  
payments from one or more of the separate account's variable investment         
accounts. Annuity payments will be based, among other things, on the amount of  
your accumulation, your choice of income option, and your choice among the      
payout options. Your payments will be based on the investment returns of the    
fund(s) underlying the variable account(s) you choose and the income charge     
method you choose. You may elect to receive monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or  
annual payments. If your annuity payments would be less than $100 under the     
payment option you choose, we may make annuity payments less frequently than    
that. The total value of annuity payments made to you may be more or less than  
the total premiums you paid under the contract.                                 

WHEN ANNUITY PAYMENTS BEGIN                                                     

Generally you pick the date when you want annuity payments to begin when you    
first apply for a contract. The date you choose can't be later than the         
annuitant's 90th birthday. You can choose or change this annuity starting date  
at any time before annuity payments begin. In any case, the annuity starting    
date will be the first day of a month and can't be earlier than fourteen months 
after the day your contract is issued. Your first annuity check may be delayed  
while we process your choice of income options and calculate the amount of your 
initial payment.                                                                

For payments to begin on the annuity starting date you chose, we must have      
received all information and documentation necessary for the income option      
you've picked. If we haven't received all the necessary information, we'll defer
the annuity starting date until the first day of the month after the information
has reached us, but not beyond the annuitant's 90th birthday. If you haven't    
picked an income option by then or if we have not otherwise received all the    
necessary information, we will begin payments under a One-Life Annuity with, if 
allowed under federal tax law, a ten year guaranteed period. The payments will  
be made out of the investment accounts to which your accumulations were         
allocated, with the initial payments in the same proportion as the accumulation.

Technically all benefits are payable at TIAA-CREF Life's home office, but if you
instruct us, we'll send your annuity payments by mail to your home address or   
(on your request) by mail or electronic fund transfer to your bank. If the      
address or bank where you want your payments changes, it's your responsibility  
to let us know. We can send payments to your residence or most banks abroad.    

INCOME PAYMENTS                                                                 

Your initial income payments out of the investment accounts will be based on:   

-  the value of your accumulation in an investment account on the last valuation
day before the annuity starting date                                      

-  the annuity option you choose                                                

-  the length of the fixed period or guaranteed period, as applicable           

-  the frequency of payment you choose                                          

-  the ages of the annuitant and any second annuitant, and                      

-  an assumed annual investment return of 4 percent and the current mortality   
basis, not to be less than that set forth in the contract's rate schedule 

Subsequent payments will be based on the investment experience of the funds     
underlying the investment accounts relative to the 4 percent assumed annual     
investment return, and the income change method you choose. In general, your    
payments will increase if the performance of the investment account (net of     
expenses) is greater than 4 percent and decrease if the performance is less than
4 percent.                                                                      

You may choose either an annual or monthly income change method for your        
variable annuity payments. Under the annual income change method, payments from 
the investment accounts will change each May 1, based on the net investment     
results of the funds underlying the investment account during the prior year    
(April 1 through March 31). Under the monthly income change method, payments    
from the investment accounts will change every month, based on the net          
investment results during the previous month. The amount of your next payment   
will be determined on the 20th day of each month (or, if the 20th is not a      
business day, the prior business day).                                          

For a full discussion of how we determine the amount of variable annuity        
payments, see the SAI.                                                          

ANNUITY OPTIONS 

You have a number of different annuity options. The current options are:        

-  ONE-LIFE ANNUITIES WITH OR WITHOUT GUARANTEED PERIOD. Pays income as long as 
  the annuitant lives. If you opt for a guaranteed period (10, 15 or 20 years)
and your annuitant

dies before it's over, income payments will continue to you or your       
  beneficiary until the end of the period. The guaranteed period cannot exceed
the annuitant's life expectancy. If you don't opt for a guaranteed period,
 all payments end at the annuitant's death--so that it's possible for you to
 receive only one payment if you die less than a month after payments start.

-  FIXED-PERIOD ANNUITIES. Pays income for a stipulated period of not less than 
two nor more than thirty years. At the end of the period you've chosen,   
 payments stop. If you die before the period is up, your beneficiary becomes
 the contractowner. The period you choose cannot exceed the annuitant's life
expectancy.                                                               

-  TWO-LIFE ANNUITIES WITH OR WITHOUT GUARANTEED PERIOD. Pays income to you as  
   long as the annuitant or second annuitant lives, then continues at either the
   same or a reduced level for the life of the survivor, or until the end of the
specified guaranteed period, whichever period is longer. The guaranteed   
 period cannot exceed the annuitants' life expectancy. There are three types
of two-life annuity options, all available with or without a guaranteed   
period--Full Benefit While Either the Annuitant or the Second Annuitant is
Alive, Two-Thirds Benefit After the Death of Either the Annuitant or the  
Second Annuitant, and a Half-Benefit After the Death of the Annuitant.    

From the investment accounts, you or your beneficiary have the right to receive 
in a lump sum the commuted value of any periodic payments or other amounts      
remaining due (i) while guaranteed period payments are being made, or (ii) under
a Fixed-Period Annuity.                                                         

TRANSFERS DURING THE ANNUITY PERIOD                                             

You will be able to transfer all or part of the future annuity income payable   
from each investment account one time each calendar quarter to another          
investment account.                                                             

We'll process your transfer on the business day we receive your request.        
Alternatively, you can choose to have a transfer take effect at the close of any
future business day, or the last calendar day of the current or any future      
month, even if it's not a business day. Transfers under the annual income       
payment method will affect your annuity payments beginning on the May 1         
following the March 31 which is on or after the effective date of the transfer. 
Transfers under the monthly income payment method will affect your annuity      
payments beginning with the first payment due after the monthly payment         
valuation day that is on or after the transfer date.                            

You can switch between the annual and monthly income change methods, and the    
switch will go into effect on the following March 31.                           

For more, see the SAI.

DEATH BENEFITS 
AVAILABILITY; CHOOSING BENEFICIARIES                                            

Death benefits are available if you or the annuitant die during the accumulation
period. When you fill out an application for a contract, you name one or more   
beneficiaries to receive the death benefit if you die. You can change your      
beneficiary at any time during the accumulation period. For more information on 
designating beneficiaries, contact TIAA-CREF Life or your legal advisor.        

SPECIAL OPTION FOR SPOUSES                                                      

If your spouse is the sole beneficiary when you die, your spouse can choose to  
become the contractowner and continue the contract, or receive the death        
benefit. If your spouse does not make a choice within 60 days after we receive  
proof of death, your spouse will automatically become the contractowner. Your   
spouse will also become the annuitant if you were the annuitant.                

PAYMENT OF DEATH BENEFIT                                                        

To authorize payment and pay a death benefit, TIAA-CREF Life must have received 
all necessary forms and documentation, including proof of death and the         
selection of the method of payment. Even if we have not received all of the     
required information, the death benefits will be paid by the first day of the   
month following the 60th day after we receive proof of death. If no method of   
payment has been chosen by that time, we will pay the death benefit as annual   
payments for a fixed period ending in the twelve-month period before the fifth  
anniversary of the death. Payments will be made in the same proportion as each  
investment account's accumulation to the contract's total investment account    
accumulation.                                                                   

AMOUNT OF DEATH BENEFIT                                                         

We calculate the death benefit every business day. The amount of the death      
benefit as of the death benefit date will equal the greater of (1) your         
accumulation or (2) the guaranteed minimum death benefit. The guaranteed minimum
death benefit as of any valuation day is equal to the sum of all premiums       
credited less the adjusted sum of any withdrawals made. The adjusted sum of     
withdrawals is the sum of the products of each withdrawal multiplied by the     
greater of 1 and the ratio of A to B, where:                                    

A  is the value of the guaranteed minimum death benefit on the valuation day    
preceding the withdrawal; and                                             

B  is the contract accumulation on the valuation day of the withdrawal,         
excluding the effect of any transactions on that day.                     

If a benefit is payable under the guaranteed minimum death benefit provision on 
the day we first receive proof of death, any shortfall between the amount of the
guaranteed minimum death benefit and the accumulated value of the entire        
contract will be deposited by TIAA-CREF Life into the Money Market Account. This
amount will continue to participate in the investment experience of the Money   
Market Account until the day death benefits are paid.

METHODS OF PAYMENT OF DEATH BENEFITS                                            

At present, the sole method of payment for death benefits is:                   

-  SINGLE-SUM PAYMENT. The entire death benefit is paid at once. When the       
 beneficiary is an estate, the single-sum method is automatic, and TIAA-CREF
Life reserves the right to pay death benefits only as a single sum to any 
beneficiary that is not a natural person. Single-sum payments must be made
within five years of your death.                                          

TIAA-CREF Life may offer alternative methods of payment for death benefits in   
the future, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. You will be notified 
in advance if alternative death benefit payment methods become available.       

TIMING OF PAYMENTS 

Usually we'll make the following kinds of payments from the investment accounts 
within seven calendar days after we've received the information we need to      
process a request:                                                              

1.  Cash withdrawals;                                                           

2.  Transfers to another investment account or another company; and             

3.  Death benefits.                                                             

We can extend the seven-day period only if (1) the NYSE is closed (or trading   
restricted by the SEC) on a day that isn't a weekend or holiday; (2) an         
SEC-recognized emergency makes it impractical for us to sell securities or      
determine the value of assets in the separate account; or (3) the SEC says by   
order that we can or must postpone payments to protect you and other separate   
account contractowners.                                                         

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 

The following discussion is based on our understanding of current federal income
tax law, and is subject to change. For complete information on your personal tax
situation, check with a qualified tax advisor.                                  

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES                                                           

The following discussion assumes the contracts qualify as annuity contracts for 
federal income tax purposes (see the SAI for more information):                 

IN GENERAL. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 72 governs annuity taxation     
generally. We believe an owner who is a natural person usually won't be taxed on
increases in the value of a contract until there is a distribution (i.e., the   
owner withdraws all or part of the accumulation or takes annuity payments).     
Since transfers among investment accounts under the contract aren't considered  
distributions, they won't be taxed. Assigning, pledging, or agreeing to assign  
or pledge any part of the accumulation usually will be considered a             
distribution.                                                                   

24 PROSPECTUS Lifetime Variable Select                                    

P-->49725th Page of 64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
Withdrawals of accumulated investment earnings are taxable as ordinary income.  
Generally under the IRC, withdrawals are first allocated to investment earnings.

The owner of any annuity contract who is not a natural person (such as a trust) 
generally must include in income any increases in the value of the contract     
during the taxable year.                                                        

The following discussion applies generally to contracts owned by a natural      
person:                                                                         

WITHDRAWALS. If you withdraw funds from your contract before the annuity        
starting date, IRC section 72(e) usually deems taxable any amounts received to  
the extent that the accumulation value at the time you withdraw exceeds your    
investment in the contract. The investment in the contract usually equals all   
premiums paid by the contractowner or on the contractowner's behalf.            

If you withdraw your entire accumulation under a contract, you will be taxed    
only on the part that exceeds your investment in the contract.                  

ANNUITY PAYMENTS. Although tax consequences can vary with the income option you 
pick, IRC section 72(b) provides generally that, before you recover the         
investment in the contract, part of each annuity income payment is treated as   
recovery of your investment in the contract, and can be excluded from your      
income. After you recover your investment in the contract, all additional       
annuity payments are fully taxable.                                             

TAXATION OF DEATH BENEFIT PROCEEDS. Amounts may be paid from a contract because 
an owner has died. If the payments are made in a single sum, they're taxed the  
same way a full withdrawal from the contract is taxed. If they are distributed  
as annuity payments, they're taxed as annuity payments.                         

PENALTY TAX ON SOME WITHDRAWALS. You may have to pay a penalty tax (10 percent  
of the amount treated as taxable income) on some withdrawals. However, there is 
usually no penalty on distributions:                                            

(1)  on or after you reach age 59 1/2;                                          

(2)  after you die (or after the annuitant dies, if the owner isn't an          
individual);                                                          

(3)  after you become disabled; or                                              

(4)  that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic (at least annual)
  payments for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint
life expectancies) of you and your beneficiary.                       

POSSIBLE TAX CHANGES. Legislation is proposed from time to time that would      
change the taxation of annuity contracts. It is possible that such legislation  
could be enacted and that it could be retroactive (that is, effective prior to  
the date of the change). You should consult a tax adviser regarding legislative 
developments and their effect on the contract.

TRANSFERS, ASSIGNMENTS OR EXCHANGES OF A CONTRACT 

Transferring contract ownership, pledging the contract as security for a loan,  
designating an annuitant, payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner, 
or exchanging a contract can have other tax consequences that we don't discuss  
here. If you're thinking about any of those transactions, contact a tax advisor.

WITHHOLDING                                                                     

Annuity distributions are usually subject to withholding for the recipient's    
federal income tax liability at rates that vary according to the type of        
distribution and the recipient's tax status. However, recipients can usually    
choose not to have tax withheld from distributions.                             

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS 

In determining gross income, section 72(e) will treat as one contract all       
TIAA-CREF Life and TIAA non-qualified deferred annuity contracts issued to the  
same owner during any calendar year. This could affect when income is taxable   
and how much might be subject to the 10 percent penalty tax (see above). Consult
a tax advisor before buying more than one annuity contract for the purpose of   
gaining a tax advantage.                                                        

POSSIBLE CHARGE FOR TIAA-CREF LIFE'S TAXES                                      

Currently we don't charge the separate account for any federal, state, or local 
taxes on it or its contracts (other than premium taxes--see page 20), but we    
reserve the right to charge the separate account or the contracts for any tax or
other cost resulting from the tax laws that we believe should be attributed to  
them.                                                                           

TAX ADVICE                                                                      

What we tell you here about federal and other taxes isn't comprehensive and is  
for general information only. It doesn't cover every situation. Taxation varies 
depending on the circumstances, and state and local taxes may also be involved. 
For complete information on your personal tax situation, check with a qualified 
tax advisor.                                                                    

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION; CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 

We may advertise the total return and average annual total return of the        
separate account. "Total return" means the cumulative percentage increase or    
decrease in the value of an investment over standard one-, five-, and ten-year  
periods (and occasionally other periods as well).                               

"Average annual total return" means the annually compounded rate that would     
result in the same cumulative total return over the stated period.              

All performance figures are based on past investment results. They aren't a     
guarantee that the separate account will perform equally or similarly in the    
future. Write, call, or access the TIAA-CREF Web Center for current performance 
figures for the separate account's investment accounts.

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

The amount of annuity payments we pay will depend upon the number and value of  
your annuity units in a particular investment account. The number of annuity    
units is first determined on the day before the annuity payments begin. The     
amount of the annuity payments will change according to the income change method
chosen.                                                                         

NUMBER OF ANNUITY UNITS PAYABLE. When a contractowner or beneficiary starts     
receiving annuity payments, the number of annuity units payable from each       
investment account under an income change method will be determined by dividing 
the value of the account accumulation to be applied to provide the annuity      
payments, by the product of the annuity unit value for that income change       
method, and a factor that represents the present value of an annuity that       
continues for as long as annuity payments would need to be paid. This factor    
will reflect an interest rate for discounting future payments of 4 percent, the 
timing and frequency of future payments, and, if applicable, the mortality      
assumptions for the person(s) on whose life (lives) the annuity payments will be
based. Mortality assumptions will be based on the settlement mortality schedules
set forth in the contract.                                                      

The number of annuity units for each investment account and income change method
remains fixed unless there is a "transfer" of annuity units or you change your  
income change method. The number of annuity units payable from a particular     
investment account and income change method under your contract will be reduced 
by the number of annuity units you transfer out of that investment account or   
income change method under your contract. The number of annuity units payable   
will be increased by any internal transfers you make to that investment account 
and income change method.                                                       

CALCULATING ANNUITY UNIT VALUES. The annuity unit value for each investment     
account is calculated separately for each income change method for each business
day and for the last calendar day of each month. The annuity unit value for each
income change method is determined by updating the annuity unit value from the  
previous valuation day to reflect the net investment performance of the account 
for the current valuation period relative to the 4 percent assumed investment   
return. We further adjust the annuity unit value to reflect the fact that       
annuity payment amounts are redetermined only once a month or once a year       
(depending on the revaluation method chosen). The purpose of the adjustment is  
to equitably apportion any account gains or losses among those annuitants who   
receive annuity income for the entire period between valuation dates and those  
who start or stop receiving annuity income between the two dates. In general,   
from period to period your payments will increase if the net performance of the 
account is greater than a 4 percent net annual rate of return and decrease if   
the net performance is less than a 4 percent net annual rate of return.         

For participants under the annual income change method, the value of the annuity
unit for payments remains level until the following May l. For those who have   
already begun receiving annuity income as of March 31, the value of the annuity 
unit for payments due on and after the next succeeding May 1 is equal to the    
annuity unit value determined as of such March 31.                              

For participants under the monthly income change method, the value of the       
annuity unit for payments changes on the payment valuation day of each month for
the payment due on the first of the following month.                            

TIAA-CREF Life reserves the right to modify the specific dates that payments    
will change and the associated payment valuation date. We also can delete or    
stop offering the annual or monthly income change methods.                      

TAX STATUS OF THE CONTRACT 

DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
and the regulations under it provide that separate account investments          
underlying a nonqualified contract must be "adequately diversified" for it to   
qualify as an annuity contract under IRC section 72. The separate account       
intends to comply with the diversification requirements of the regulations under
section 817(h). This will affect how we make investments.                       

Under the IRC, you could be considered the owner of the assets of the separate  
account used to support your contract. If this happens, you'd have to include   
income and gains from the separate account assets in your gross income. The IRS 
has published rulings stating that a variable contractowner will be considered  
the owner of separate account assets if the contractowner has any powers that   
the actual owner of the assets might have, such as the ability to exercise      
investment control.                                                             

Your ownership rights under the contract are similar but not identical to those 
described by the IRS in rulings that held that contractowners were not owners of
separate account assets, so the IRS therefore might not rule the same way in    
your case. TIAA-CREF Life reserves the right to change the contract if necessary
to help prevent your being considered the owner of the separate account's       
assets.                                                                         

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS. All payments upon death of a contractowner will be made 
according to the requirements of section 72(s) of the IRC. Under that IRC       
section, if you die before we begin making annuity payments, all payments under 
the contract must be distributed within five years of your death. However, if   
your beneficiary is a natural person and payments begin within one year of your 
death, and within 60 days of the date we receive due proof of death, the        
distribution may be made over the lifetime of your beneficiary or over a period 
not to exceed your beneficiary's life expectancy, as defined in the IRC. If your
spouse is the sole beneficiary entitled to payments, he or she may choose to    
become the owner and continue the contract. If you die on or after the date we  
begin making annuity payments, the remaining interest in the contract must be   
distributed at least as quickly as under the method of distribution being used  
as of the date of your death. If the owner is not a natural person, the death of
the annuitant is treated as the death of the owner for these distribution       
requirements.

The contract is designed to comply with section 72(s). TIAA-CREF Life will      
review the contract and amend it if necessary to make sure that it continues to 
comply with the section's requirements.                                         

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 
TOTAL RETURN INFORMATION FOR THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT                               

Total return quotations for the investment accounts of the separate account may 
be advertised. Total return quotations will reflect all aspects of the          
investment account's return. Average annual total returns are determined by     
finding the average annual compounded rate of return over a period that reflects
the growth (or decline) in value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the
beginning of the period through the end of that period, according to the        
following formula:                                                              

                                                                [Download Table]

         P(1 + T)(n) = EV                                          
where:   P     =     hypothetical initial payment of $1,000        
         T     =     average annual total return                   
         n     =     number of years in the period                 
         EV    =     ending value of the hypothetical investment at
                     the end of the 1, 5, or 10 year period.       

To derive the total return quotations from this formula, the percentage net     
change in the value of the $1,000 investment from the beginning of the period to
the end of such period ("cumulative total return") is determined. Cumulative    
total returns simply reflect the change in value of an investment over a stated 
period. Since the accumulation unit value is a "total return" unit value that   
reflects the investment experience of the particular investment account of the  
separate account and all expense deductions made against the assets of the      
separate account, the ending value, or EV, of the $1,000 hypothetical investment
is determined by applying the percentage change in the accumulation unit value  
over the period to the hypothetical initial payment of $1,000 less the current  
deductions from premiums (0%). We then solve the equation for T to derive the   
average annual compounded rate of return for the separate account over the span 
of the period, and the resulting "total return" quotation is carried out to the 
nearest hundredth of one percent.

PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS                                                         

Performance information for the separate account and its investment accounts may
be compared, in advertisements, sales literature, and reports to contractowners 
and annuitants, to the performance information reported by other investments and
to various indices and averages. Such comparisons may be made with, but are not 
limited to (1) the S&P 500, (2) the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA"), (3)  
Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Mutual Fund Performance Analysis Reports and   
the Lipper General Equity Funds Average, (4) Money Magazine Fund Watch, (5)

inflation), (12) Morningstar, Inc., (13) the Morgan Stanley Capital             
International ("MSCI") global market indices, including the Europe, Australasia,

Index and Morgan Stanley REIT Index, (14) Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co.,      
Inc.'s Broad Market Social Index, (15) NAREIT Equity REIT Index, (16) Lehman    
Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, and (17) iMoneyNet Fund Report Average -- All    
Taxable. We may also discuss ratings or rankings received from these entities,  
accompanied in some cases by an explanation of those ratings or rankings, when  
applicable. In addition, advertisements may discuss the performance of the      
indices listed above.                                                           

The performance of the variable investment accounts also may be compared to     
other indices or averages that measure performance of other variable contracts, 
or other pertinent groups of securities. Contractowners should keep in mind that
the composition of the investments in the reported averages will not be         
identical to that of the separate account and that certain formula calculations 
(i.e., yield) may differ from index to index. In addition, there can be no      
assurance that the separate account will continue its performance as compared to
such indices.                                                                   

ILLUSTRATING COMPOUNDING, TAX DEFERRAL, AND EXPENSE DEDUCTIONS                  

We may illustrate in advertisements, sales literature and reports to            
contractowners or annuitants the effects of tax deferral and/or compounding of  
earnings on an investment in the separate account. We may do this using a       
hypothetical investment earning a specified rate of return. To illustrate the   
effects of compounding, we would show how the total return from an investment of
the same dollar amount, earning the same or different interest rate, varies     
depending on when the investment was made. To illustrate the effects of tax     
deferral, we will show how the total return from an investment of the same      
dollar amount, earning the same or different interest rates, for individuals in 
the same tax bracket, would vary between tax-deferred and taxable investments.  

We may also illustrate in advertisements, sales literature and reports to       
contractowners or annuitants the effect of an investment fund's expenses on     
total return over time. We may do this using a hypothetical investment earning a
specified rate of return. We would show how the total return, net of expenses,  
from an investment of the same dollar amount in funds with the same investment  
results but different expense deductions varies increasingly over time. In the  
alternative, we would show the difference in the dollar amount of total expense 
charges paid over time by an investor in two or more different funds that have  
the same annual total return but different asset-based expense charges. We may  
also compare the separate account's expense charges to those of other variable  
annuities and other investment products.                                        

ILLUSTRATING HOW ACCUMULATIONS TRANSLATE INTO ANNUITY PAYMENTS                  

We may provide to contractowners or annuitants hypothetical illustrations       
showing how an accumulation might translate into annuity payments. Illustrations
may be based on hypothetical rates of return for the variable

STATEMENTS AND REPORTS 

You will receive a confirmation statement each time you remit premiums, or make 
a transfer or cash withdrawal to or from the separate account or among the      
variable investment accounts. The statement will show the date and amount of    
each transaction. However, if you're using an automatic investment plan, you'll 
receive a statement confirming those transactions immediately following the end 
of each calendar quarter.                                                       

If you have any accumulations in the separate account, you will be sent a       
statement each quarter which sets forth the following:                          

(1) premiums paid during the quarter;                                         

(2) the number and dollar value of accumulation units in the variable         
     investment accounts credited to the contractowner during the quarter and in
total;                                                                

(3) cash withdrawals from the variable investment accounts during the quarter;
and                                                                   

(4) any transfers among the separate account's variable investment accounts   
during the quarter.                                                   

You will also receive, at least semi-annually, reports containing the financial 
statements of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds and a schedule of investments held by the
TIAA-CREF Life Funds.

is made.                                                                        

BENEFITS BASED ON INCORRECT INFORMATION                                         

If the amounts of benefits provided under a contract were based on information  
that is incorrect, benefits will be recalculated on the basis of the correct    
data. If any overpayments or underpayments have been made by the separate       
account, appropriate adjustments will be made.                                  

PROOF OF SURVIVAL                                                               

We reserve the right to require satisfactory proof that anyone named to receive 
benefits under a contract is living on the date payment is due. If this proof is
not received after a request in writing, the separate account will have the     
right to make reduced payments or to withhold payments entirely until such proof
is received.                                                                    

STATE REGULATION 

TIAA-CREF Life and the separate account are subject to regulation by the State  
of New York Superintendent of Insurance ("Superintendent") as well as by the    
insurance regulatory authorities of certain other states and jurisdictions.     

TIAA-CREF Life and the separate account must file with the Superintendent       
periodic statements on forms promulgated by the State of New York Insurance     
Department. The separate account books and assets are subject to review and     
examination by the Superintendent and the Superintendent's agents at all times, 
and a full examination into the affairs of the separate account is made at least
every five years. In addition, a full examination of the separate account's     
operations is usually conducted periodically by some other states.              

LEGAL MATTERS 

All matters of applicable state law pertaining to the contracts, including      
TIAA-CREF Life's right to issue the contracts, have been passed upon by the     
Executive Vice President and General Counsel of TIAA. Sutherland Asbill &       
Brennan LLP, Washington, D.C., has provided advice on certain matters relating  
to the federal securities laws.                                                 

EXPERTS 

The financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company and the separate   
account included in this Statement of Additional Information have been audited  
by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, as stated in their reports appearing
herein, and have been so included in reliance upon the reports of such firm     
given upon their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. Ernst & Young 
LLP is located at 5 Times Square, New York, New York 10036.                     

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Over the past several years, TIAA and CREF have added many new investment       
vehicles to their line of products. The growing family of products of the       
TIAA-CREF group of companies is designed to provide additional investment       
options for those who want to diversify their holdings. Most experts recommend  
diversification as a good strategy for retirement and other long-term investing,
both because a diversified portfolio offers a degree of safety from the         
volatility of specific markets, and because it allows the investor to benefit   
from the potential for growth in several different types of investments.        

The investment accounts offered under the Lifetime Variable Select variable     
annuity contract are suited for people who are able to make long-term           
investments. Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, in the
past stocks have outperformed many other types of investments. Investors who    
seek to counter the effects of inflation on their long-term investments should  
therefore consider investing in stocks. The investment accounts offered under   
the Lifetime Variable Select contract could be an appropriate investment for    
someone who is seeking to supplement his or her retirement income, to purchase a
retirement home, finance an extended trip, or build a fund for philanthropic    
purposes. Of course, there is no guarantee that the investment objectives of the
funds will be met.                                                              

Before investing, you should consider whether your pension plan and social      
security payments will meet your retirement needs. You should look at your      
assets and liabilities to help determine whether you need to invest more money  
to help provide retirement income. You should consider how much time you have   
until retirement and the effect of inflation and taxes on your savings and      
investments. You should also keep in mind that experts say that people need 70% 
to 80% of their pre-retirement income to maintain the same standard of living   
after retirement. Before contributing to a contract, you should consider whether
you have already reached your contribution limit on your 401(k) or 403(b)       
savings plans. Consult your tax advisor to learn more about these limits.       

You should also consider what types of investments are best suited for you and  
your current needs. In particular, you should consider the tax treatment of a   
variable annuity as compared with a standard mutual fund product. With          
annuities, earnings generally grow tax-deferred and investors are provided the  
option of lifetime income upon retirement. However, annuities

may have restrictions on withdrawals before age 59 1/2, and thus may not be     
suitable for goals other than retirement. Also, variable annuity withdrawals may
be taxed differently than mutual fund redemptions. We may compare annuities to  
mutual funds in sales literature and advertisements.                            

We may discuss and compare our array of products and services. At such times we 
disclose which of our subsidiaries or affiliates issues which products or types 
of products, as follows: Services distributes CREF certificates and interests in
the TIAA Real Estate Account. TPIS distributes personal annuities, mutual funds,
variable life insurance contracts and tuition savings agreements. TIAA and      
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company issue insurance and annuities. TIAA-CREF Trust 
Company, FSB provides trust services. We also disclose that the investment      
products are not FDIC insured, may lose value and are not bank guaranteed.      

You should also consider the risks of any investment relative to its potential  
rewards. In particular, you should be aware of the risk that arises from market 
timing. Market timing is an investment technique whereby amounts are transferred
from one category of investment to another (for example, from stocks to bonds)  
based upon a perception of how each of those categories of investments will     
perform relative to the others at a particular time. Investors who engage in    
market timing run the risk that they may transfer out of a type of investment   
with a rising market value or transfer into a type of investment with a falling 
market value. We do not endorse the practice of market timing.                  

The variety of issues to consider highlights the importance of the support and  
services that we provide. These services include: (1) retirement and life       
insurance planning expertise from professional counselors rather than           
commissioned salespeople; (2) detailed information through quarterly transaction
reports, newsletters and other publications about retirement planning; and (3)  
seminars, individual counseling, an Information Center, and 24-hour automated   
toll-free numbers and a website for transactions and inquiries. If you request  
it, we will send you periodic reminders to remit premiums to the contract.      

Customer service may be an important consideration for you. In our              
advertisements we may report the results of surveys conducted by independent    
agencies regarding customer service. We may also use certain testimonials and   
quote financial experts, financial and other publications, or other services    
regarding our products and services. We may also discuss in advertisements and  
sales literature general economic and/or market conditions that may impact      
investments in variable annuities.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY 

To the Contractowners of                                                        
TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1:                                       

The accompanying financial statements of the Growth Equity, Growth & Income,    
International Equity, Large-Cap Value, Small-Cap Equity, Stock Index, Social    
Choice Equity, and Real Estate Securities Sub-Accounts of TIAA-CREF Life        
Separate Account VA-1 (the "Sub-Accounts") are the responsibility of management.
They have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally      
accepted in the United States, and have been presented fairly and objectively in
accordance with such principles.                                                

TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company ("TIAA-CREF Life") has established and         
maintains a strong system of internal controls and disclosure controls designed 
to provide reasonable assurance that assets are properly safeguarded and        
transactions are properly executed in accordance with management's              
authorization, and to carry out the ongoing responsibilities of management for  
reliable financial statements. In addition, TIAA-CREF Life's internal audit     
personnel provide a continuing review of the internal controls and operation of 
the Sub-Accounts, and the chief audit executive regularly reports to the Audit  
Committee of the Management Committee.                                          

The accompanying financial statements have been audited by the independent      
auditing firm of Ernst & Young LLP. To maintain auditor independence and avoid  
even the appearance of conflict of interest, it continues to be the             
Sub-Accounts' policy that any management advisory or consulting services be     
obtained from a firm other than the external financial audit firm. For the      
periods covered by these financial statements, Sub-Accounts did not engage Ernst
& Young LLP for any management advisory or consulting services. The independent 
auditors' report, which follows the notes to financial statements, expresses an 
independent opinion on the fairness of presentation of these financial          
statements.                                                                     

The Audit Committee of the Sub-Accounts' Management Committee consisting        
entirely of the members who are not officers of the Sub-Accounts, meets         
regularly with management, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP and internal    
audit personnel to review matters relating to financial reporting, internal     
controls, and auditing. In addition to the annual audit of the financial        
statements of the Sub-Accounts by the independent auditing firm, the New York   
State Insurance Department, other state insurance departments and the Securities
and Exchange Commission perform periodic examinations of the Sub-Accounts'      
operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Contractowners of                                                        
TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1:                                       

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the    
Growth Equity, Growth & Income, International Equity, Stock Index, Social Choice
Equity, Large Cap Value, Small Cap Value and Real Estate Securities Sub-        
Accounts of TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 (the "Sub-Accounts") as of     
December 31, 2002, and the related statements of operations and changes in net  
assets for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Sub-Account's management. Our responsibility is to    
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.           

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of the Growth Equity, Growth &    
Income, International Equity, Stock Index, Social Choice Equity, Large Cap      
Value, Small Cap Value and Real Estate Securities Sub-Accounts at December 31,
2002, and the results of their operations and the changes in their net assets   
for each of the indicated periods, in conformity with accounting principles     
generally accepted in the United States.

TIAA-CREF Life provides all administrative services for the Sub-Accounts.       
Teachers Personal Investors Services, Inc. ("TPIS"), a subsidiary of TIAA, which
is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and is a member of the     
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., performs distribution         
functions for the contracts pursuant to a Principal Underwriting and            
Administrative Services Agreement.                                              

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with          
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which may require 
the use of estimates made by management. Actual results may differ from those   
estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies    
consistently followed by the Sub-Accounts.                                      

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS: The market value of the investments in the Funds is   
based on the net asset value of the Funds as of the close of business on the    
valuation date.                                                                 

ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS: Securities transactions are accounted for as of the 
trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains 
and losses on security transactions are based on the specific identification    
method.                                                                         

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: Based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, no      
federal taxes are attributable to the net investment experience of the          
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

NOTE 2. EXPENSE CHARGES                                                         

Daily charges are deducted from the net assets of the Sub-Accounts for services 
required to administer the Sub-Accounts and the contracts, and to cover certain 
insurance risks borne by TIAA-CREF Life. The administrative expense charge is   
currently set at an annual rate of 0.20% of the net assets of the Sub-Accounts. 
TIAA-CREF Life also imposes a daily charge for bearing certain mortality and    
expense risks in connection with the contracts equivalent to an annual rate of  
0.10% of the net assets of the Sub-Accounts.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY 

To the Policyholders of                                                         
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company:                                           

The accompanying statutory-basis financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life         
Insurance Company, ("TIAA-CREF Life") are the responsibility of management. They
have been prepared on the basis of statutory accounting practices, a            
comprehensive basis of accounting comprised of accounting practices prescribed  
or permitted by the New York State Insurance Department. The financial          
statements of TIAA-CREF Life have been presented fairly and objectively in      
accordance with such statutory accounting practices.                            

TIAA-CREF Life has established and maintains a strong system of internal        
controls and disclosure controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that  
assets are properly safeguarded and transactions are properly executed in       
accordance with management's authorization, and to carry out the ongoing        
responsibilities of management for reliable financial statements. In addition,  
TIAA-CREF Life's internal audit personnel provide a continuing review of the    
internal controls and operations of TIAA-CREF Life, and the internal auditor    
regularly reports to the Audit Committee of the TIAA-CREF Life Board of         
Directors.                                                                      

The independent auditing firm of Ernst & Young LLP has audited the accompanying 
statutory-basis financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life. To maintain auditor     
independence and avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest, it continues
to be TIAA-CREF Life's policy that any management advisory or consulting        
services be obtained from a firm other than the external financial audit firm.  
For the periods covered by these financial statements, TIAA-CREF Life did not   
engage Ernst & Young LLP for any management advisory or consulting services. The
independent auditors' report expresses an independent opinion on the fairness of
presentation of these statutory-basis financial statements.                     

The Audit Committee of the TIAA-CREF Life Board of Directors meets regularly    
with management, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP and internal auditing     
personnel to review matters relating to financial reporting, internal controls  
and auditing. In addition to the annual audit of the TIAA-CREF Life financial   
statements, the New York State Insurance Department and other state insurance   
departments regularly examine the financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life as part
of their periodic corporate examinations.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 

To the Policyholders of                                                         
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company:                                           

The Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting process of TIAA-CREF Life  
Insurance Company, ("TIAA-CREF Life") on behalf of the Company's Board of       
Directors. The Audit Committee is a standing committee of the Board and operates
in accordance with a formal written charter (copies are available upon request) 
which describes the Audit Committee's responsibilities.                         

Management has the primary responsibility for TIAA-CREF Life's financial        
statements, development and maintenance of a strong system of internal controls,
and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and approved the audit plans of the    
internal auditing group and the independent auditing firm in connection with    
their respective audits. The Committee also meets regularly with the internal   
and independent auditors to discuss the results of their examinations, their    
evaluation of internal controls, and the overall quality of financial reporting.
The Committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation and   
oversight of the independent auditing firm. As required by its charter, the     
Committee will evaluate rotation of the external financial audit firm whenever  
circumstances warrant, but in no event will the evaluation be later than between
their fifth and tenth years of service.                                         

The Committee reviewed and discussed the accompanying audited financial         
statements with management, including a discussion of the quality and           
appropriateness of the accounting principles and financial reporting practices  
followed, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of       
disclosures in the financial statements. The Committee has also discussed the   
audited financial statements with Ernst & Young LLP, the independent auditing   
firm responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of these audited   
financial statements with statutory accounting principles.                      

The discussion with Ernst & Young LLP focused on their judgments concerning the 
quality and appropriateness of the accounting principles and financial reporting
practices followed by TIAA-CREF Life, the clarity of the financial statements   
and related disclosures, and other significant matters, such as any significant 
changes in accounting policies, management judgments and estimates, and the     
nature of any uncertainties or unusual transactions. In addition, the Committee 
discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the auditors' independence from management, and
TIAA-CREF Life has received a written disclosure regarding such independence, as
required by the Independence Standards Board.                                   

Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Committee has        
approved the release of the accompanying audited financial statements for       
publication and filing with appropriate regulatory authorities.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company:                                           

We have audited the accompanying statutory-basis balance sheets of TIAA-CREF    
Life Insurance Company, ("TIAA-CREF Life") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the related statutory-basis statements of operations, changes in capital and    
surplus, and cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2002. These      
financial statements are the responsibility of TIAA-CREF Life's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on  
our audits.                                                                     

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, TIAA-CREF Life presents its 
financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or      
permitted by the New York State Insurance Department, which practices differ    
from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The         
variances between such practices and accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States are described in Note 2. The effects on the financial         
statements of these variances are not reasonably determinable but are presumed  
to be material.                                                                 

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding 
paragraph, the financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,  
the financial position of TIAA-CREF Life at December 31, 2002 and 2001, or the  
results of its operations or its cash flows for the three years ended December
31, 2002.                                                                       

However, in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present     
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TIAA-CREF Life at   
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with          
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York State Insurance    
Department.                                                                     

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2001, TIAA-CREF Life     
changed various accounting policies to be in accordance with the revised        
National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Accounting Practices and       
Procedures Manual, as adopted by the New York State Insurance Department. Also, 
as discussed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements, in 2002 TIAA-CREF Life began
to admit deferred federal income tax assets in accordance with Statement of     
Statutory Accounting Principles Number 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Statutory -- Basis Financial Statements (amounts in                    
thousands)  DECEMBER 31, 2002
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS                                             

TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company commenced operations as a legal reserve life   
insurance company under the insurance laws of the State of New York on December
18, 1996, under its former name, TIAA Life Insurance Company and changed its    
name to TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, ("TIAA-CREF Life"), on May 1, 1998.   
TIAA-CREF Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIAA-CREF Enterprises, Inc.,     
("Enterprises"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and   
Annuity Association of America, ("TIAA"), a legal reserve life insurance company
established under the insurance laws of the State of New York in 1918. As of    
December 31, 2002, TIAA-CREF Life was licensed in 50 jurisdictions.             

TIAA-CREF Life issues non-qualified annuity contracts with fixed and variable   
components, fixed and variable universal life contracts, individual long-term   
care insurance contracts, funding agreements, term insurance and single premium 
immediate annuities.                                                            

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                         

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES: TIAA-CREF Life's statutory-basis financial    
statements have been prepared on the basis of statutory accounting practices    
prescribed or permitted by the New York State Insurance Department,             
("Department"); a comprehensive basis of accounting that differs from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, ("GAAP"). (Refer to the     
section titled "Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States"  
within this note.) Accounting changes adopted to conform to the provisions of   
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' ("NAIC"), Accounting       
Practices and Procedures Manual, ("NAIC SAP"), are reported as changes in       
accounting principles. The cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
to conform to NAIC SAP as adopted by the Department in 2001 was $0 since        
TIAA-CREF Life did not have assets, liabilities or transactions affected by the 
cumulative changes in accounting principles.                                    

On July 2, 2002, the New York State Legislature passed a bill allowing New York 
domiciled insurance companies to admit deferred federal income tax, ("DFIT")    
assets for purposes of their statutory financial statements for years ending on 
or after December 31, 2002 in accordance with Statement of Statutory Accounting 
Principles No. 10, Income Taxes. The bill was signed by the Governor of the     
State of New York on September 24, 2002. Consequently, TIAA-CREF Life admitted a
DFIT asset in the amount of approximately $994, which increased surplus at      
December 31, 2002 by the same amount.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The preparation of TIAA-CREF Life's financial statements   
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results could      
differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant      
accounting policies followed by TIAA-CREF Life:                                 

INVESTMENTS:  Investment transactions are accounted for as of the date the      
investments are purchased or sold (trade date). Realized capital gains and      
losses on investment transactions are accounted for under the specific          
identification method. A realized loss is recorded when an impairment is        
considered to be other than temporary. An impairment in an investment is

considered to have occurred if an event or change in circumstance indicates that
the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When an impairment has  
been determined to have occurred, the investment is valued at fair value.       
Management considers all available evidence to evaluate the fair value of its   
investments. Unless evidence exists to support the assertion that a decline in  
fair value below carrying value is temporary, a writedown is accounted for as a 
realized loss.                                                                  

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS:                                                       

BONDS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS:  Bonds and short-term investments (debt       
securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of acquisition) not  
in default are generally stated at amortized cost (net of any other than        
temporary impairments) and all other bonds and short-term investments at the    
lower of amortized cost (net of any other than temporary impairments) or market 
value.                                                                          

LOAN-BACKED BONDS AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES: Loan-backed bonds and structured   
securities not in default are stated at amortized cost (net of any other than   
temporary impairments). The retrospective adjustment method is used to value all
loan-backed and structured securities except for interest only securities or    
securities that have recognized losses, which are valued using the prospective  
method. Estimated future cash flows and expected payment periods are used in    
calculating amortization for loan-backed and structured securities. Loan-backed 
and structured securities in default are valued at the lower of amortized cost  
(net of any other than temporary impairments) or undiscounted estimated future  
cash flows.                                                                     

MORTGAGES: Mortgages are stated at amortized cost (net of any other than        
temporary impairments) except that purchase money mortgages are stated at the   
lower of amortized cost (net of any other than temporary impairments) or ninety 
percent of appraised value.                                                     

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS: TIAA-CREF Life has filed a Derivatives Use Plan with the
Department. This plan details TIAA-CREF Life's derivative policy objectives,    
strategies and controls and any restrictions placed on various derivative types.
The plan also specifies the procedures and systems that TIAA-CREF Life has      
established to evaluate, monitor and report on the derivative portfolio in terms
of valuation, effectiveness and counterparty credit quality. TIAA-CREF Life uses
derivative instruments for hedging purposes. TIAA-CREF Life enters into         
derivatives directly with counterparties of high credit quality (i.e., rated AA 
or better at the date of a transaction) and monitors counterparty credit quality
on an ongoing basis. TIAA-CREF Life's counterparty credit risk is limited to the
net positive fair value of its derivative positions, unless otherwise described 
below.                                                                          

    FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS: TIAA-CREF Life enters into foreign currency
    swap contracts to exchange fixed and variable amounts of foreign currency at
specified future dates and at specified rates (in U.S. dollars) to hedge
against currency risks on investments denominated in foreign currencies.
  Changes in the value of the contracts related to foreign currency exchange
    rates are recognized at the end of the period as unrealized gains or losses.
 Foreign currency swap contracts incorporate a series of swap transactions
  that result in the exchange of TIAA-CREF Life's fixed and variable foreign
currency cash flows into fixed amounts of U.S. dollar cash flows.       

   INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: TIAA-CREF Life enters into interest rate swap
contracts to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations on  
  certain variable interest rate bonds. These contracts allow TIAA-CREF Life
    to lock in a fixed interest rate and to transfer the risk of higher or lower
    interest rates. TIAA-CREF Life also enters into interest rate swap contracts
to exchange the cash flows on certain fixed interest rate bonds into    
variable interest rate cash flows in connection with certain interest   
sensitive products. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the
contract and no principal payments are made by either party. These      
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for
 a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due date. Net
  payments received and net payments made under interest rate swap contracts
are reflected in net investment income.                                 

SWAP OPTIONS: TIAA-CREF Life writes or (sells) swap options on selected 
    bonds as an income generation tool. The income generated by the sale of swap
 options is used to purchase interest rate cap contracts (see below). Swap
   options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an
  interest rate swap contract with TIAA-CREF Life where TIAA-CREF Life would
 pay a fixed interest rate and would receive a variable interest rate on a
specified notional amount. When a swap option is written, the premium   
received is recorded as a liability. Because the swap options written by
  TIAA-CREF Life expire within one year of their inception date, the premium
 is recognized as investment income at the earlier of the exercise date or
    the expiration of the swap option. TIAA-CREF Life has no counterparty credit
    risk associated with swap options written unless the option is exercised and
an interest rate swap contract is subsequently formed.

INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACTS: TIAA-CREF Life purchases interest rate cap 
    contracts to hedge against the risk of a rising interest rate environment as
   part of TIAA-CREF Life's asset and liability management program for certain
interest sensitive products. Under the terms of the interest rate cap   
contracts, the selling entity makes payments to TIAA-CREF Life on a     
 specified notional amount if an agreed-upon index exceeds a predetermined
  strike rate. Interest rate cap contracts are carried at fair market value.

NON-ADMITTED ASSETS: Certain investment balances and corresponding investment   
income due and accrued are designated as non-admitted assets by the Department, 
based on delinquencies, defaults, and other statutory criteria, and cannot be   
included in life insurance company balance sheets filed with the Department.    
There were no investment-related non-admitted assets at December 31, 2002.      
Income on bonds in default is not accrued and therefore, is not included in the 
non-admitted totals. Certain non-investment assets, such as, deferred federal   
income tax assets, furniture and fixtures and various receivables are also      
designated non-admitted assets. Such non-admitted assets approximated $11,400 at
December 31, 2002 and non-admitted deferred federal income tax assets comprised 
$11,300 of this amount. Changes in such non-admitted assets are charged or      
credited directly to surplus.                                                   

POLICY AND CONTRACT RESERVES: Policy and contract reserves are determined in    
accordance with standard valuation methods approved by the Department and are   
computed in accordance with standard actuarial formulae. The reserves           
established utilize assumptions for interest (at rates ranging from 2.25% to    
6.8% and averaging approximately 5.5%), mortality and other risks insured. Such 
reserves establish a sufficient provision for all contractual benefits          
guaranteed under policy and contract provisions.                                

ASSET VALUATION RESERVE: The Asset Valuation Reserve, ("AVR"), which covers all 
invested asset classes, is an explicit liability reserve required by the NAIC   
and is intended to provide for potential future credit and equity losses.       
Reserve components of the AVR are maintained for bonds, mortgages and           
derivatives. Realized and unrealized credit and equity capital gains and losses,
net of capital gains taxes, are credited to or charged against the related      
components of the AVR. Formula calculations determine the required contribution 
amounts for each component, and insurance companies may also make voluntary     
contributions to any component; however, the resulting ending balance cannot    
exceed the computed maximum reserve for that component. Any computed excess     
amounts are eliminated through transfers to other components or adjustments down
to the maximum reserve amounts. Contributions and adjustments to the AVR are    
reported as transfers to or from surplus.                                       

INTEREST MAINTENANCE RESERVE: The Interest Maintenance Reserve, ("IMR"), is a   
liability reserve required by the NAIC, which accumulates realized capital gains
and losses resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Such capital gains and    
losses are amortized out of the IMR, under the grouped method of amortization,  
as an adjustment to net investment income over the remaining lives of the assets
sold. The IMR balance totaled approximately $1,900 and $2,200 at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.                                                    

PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS: Life and accident and health premiums are recognized as  
revenue when due. Premiums for annuity policies with mortality risk are also    
recognized as revenue when due. Subsequent to January 1, 2001, amounts received 
for annuity policies and funding agreements without mortality risk are recorded 
using deposit accounting. Prior to January 1, 2001, amounts received for annuity
policies and funding agreements without mortality risk were recognized as       
premium revenue when due and as expenses in the increase in policy and contract 
reserves.                                                                       

REINSURANCE: Commissions on business ceded are reported as income. These        
commissions were approximately $4,500, $650 and $0 for the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.                                          

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES: The Financial    
Accounting Standards Board, ("FASB"), requires that financial statements that   
are intended to be in conformity with U.S. GAAP should follow all applicable    
authoritative accounting pronouncements. As a result, TIAA-CREF Life cannot     
refer to financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting  
practices as having been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The differences 
between accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and       
statutory accounting practices would have a material effect on TIAA-CREF Life's 
financial statements, and the primary differences can be summarized, as follows.

Under U.S. GAAP:                                                                

- The formula AVR is eliminated as a liability reserve;               

- The IMR is eliminated and realized gains and losses resulting from  
  interest rate fluctuations are reported as a component of net income
    rather than being accumulated in and subsequently amortized out of the
IMR;

- The "non-admitted" asset designation is not utilized;               

     - Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the
  policies issued rather than being charged to operations as incurred;

- Policy and contract reserves are based on estimates of expected     
       mortality, morbidity, persistency and interest rather than being based on
statutory mortality, morbidity and interest requirements;         

- Commissions on business ceded are deferred and amortized with policy
acquisition costs;                                                

- Long-term bond investments considered to be "available for sale" are
carried at fair value rather than at amortized cost;              

    - Under U.S. GAAP, state taxes are included in the computation of deferred
      taxes, a deferred tax asset is recorded for the amount of gross deferred
tax asset expected to be realized in future years, and a valuation
     allowance is established for deferred tax assets not realizable, rather
than being limited by quantitative limitations under NAIC SAP;    

- Derivatives are generally valued at fair value rather than being    
accounted for in a manner consistent with the hedged item.        

Management believes that the effects of these differences would increase        
TIAA-CREF Life's total capital and surplus if U.S. GAAP were implemented.       

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements

MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS: TIAA-CREF Life makes mortgage loans that are         
principally collateralized by commercial real estate. TIAA-CREF Life's mortgage 
underwriting standards generally result in first mortgage liens on completed    
income-producing properties for which the loan-to-value ratio at the time of    
closing generally ranges between 65% and 80%. TIAA-CREF Life employs a system to
monitor the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors 
on the collectibility of mortgage loans. This system is utilized to identify and
quantify any impairments in value. The coupon rates for mortgage loans issued   
during 2002 ranged from 6.0% to 6.5%.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may  
have the right to prepay mortgage loans, although prepayment premiums may be    
applicable.                                                                     

The funding of mortgage loan commitments is generally contingent upon the       
underlying properties meeting specified requirements, including construction,   
leasing and occupancy. At December 31, 2002, TIAA-CREF Life had no outstanding  
forward commitments for future mortgage loan investments.

NOTE 5. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                   

The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments presented in the      
following tables have been determined by TIAA-CREF Life using market information
available as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and appropriate valuation

instruments for which there are no available market value quotations. The       
estimates presented are not necessarily

BONDS: The fair values for publicly traded long-term bond investments are       
determined using quoted market prices. For privately placed long-term bond      
investments without a readily ascertainable market value, such values are       
determined with the assistance of an independent pricing service utilizing a    
discounted cash flow methodology based on coupon rates, maturity provisions and 
assigned credit ratings.

INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: The fair values of interest rate swap contracts,  
which are used for hedging purposes, are the estimated net gains or losses that 
TIAA-CREF Life would record if the interest rate swaps were liquidated at       
year-end. The swap agreements have no carrying value. The fair values of        
interest rate swap contracts are estimated internally based on anticipated      
interest rates and estimated future cash flows, and such values are reviewed for
reasonableness with estimates from TIAA-CREF Life's counterparties.             

SWAP OPTIONS: The fair values of swap options, which are used for hedging       
purposes, are the estimated amounts that TIAA-CREF Life would receive/(pay) if  
the swap options were liquidated at year-end. The fair values of the swap       
options are estimated by external parties, including TIAA-CREF Life's           
counterparties, and such values are reviewed internally for reasonableness based
on anticipated interest rates and estimated future cash flows.                  

INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACTS: The fair values of interest rate cap contracts,    
which are used for hedging purposes, are the estimated amounts that TIAA-CREF   
Life would receive if the interest rate cap contracts were liquidated at        
year-end. The fair values of the interest rate cap contracts are estimated by   
external parties, including TIAA-CREF Life's counterparties, and such values are
reviewed internally for reasonableness based on anticipated interest rates and  
estimated future cash flows.                                                    

FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS: The fair values of foreign currency swap       
contracts, which are used for hedging purposes, are the estimated net gains or  
losses that TIAA-CREF Life would record if the foreign currency swaps were      
liquidated at year-end. The fair values of foreign currency swap contracts are  
estimated internally based on future cash flows and anticipated foreign exchange
relationships, and such values are reviewed for reasonableness with values from 
TIAA-CREF Life's counterparties.                                                

INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS: TIAA-CREF Life's insurance and annuity         
contracts, other than the Personal Annuity Select contract disclosed above,     
entail mortality risks and are, therefore, exempt from the fair value disclosure
requirements related to financial instruments.                                  

NOTE 6. SEPARATE ACCOUNT                                                        

TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1, ("VA-1"), is a unit investment trust with 
all of its assets invested in an underlying portfolio of mutual funds, TIAA-CREF
Life Funds. Currently, TIAA-CREF Life Funds have eight investment portfolios:   
Growth Fund, Growth and Income Fund, International Equity Fund, Stock Index     
Fund, Social Choice Equity Fund, Large-Cap Value Fund, Small-Cap Value Fund and 
Real Estate Securities Fund. The value of seed money invested by TIAA-CREF      
Life's general account in the unit investment trust at December 31, 2002 and    
2001 was approximately $600 and $400, respectively. The account offers full or  
partial withdrawal at market value with no surrender charge.                    

TIAA-CREF Life provides mortality and expense guarantees to VA-1, for which it  
is compensated. TIAA-CREF Life guarantees that at death, the total death benefit
payable from the fixed and variable accounts will be at least a return of total 
premiums paid less any previous withdrawals. TIAA-CREF Life also guarantees that
expense charges to VA-1 participants will never rise above the maximum amount   
stipulated in the contract.                                                     

The TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VLI-1, ("VLI-1"), is a unit investment trust
and was organized May 23, 2001. It was established under New York Law for the   
purpose of issuing and funding flexible premium variable universal life         
insurance policies. All of VLI-1's assets are invested in an underlying         
portfolio of mutual funds, TIAA-CREF Life Funds. Currently VLI-1 invests in five
investment accounts of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds: Growth Fund, Growth and Income 
Fund, International Equity Fund, Stock Index Fund and Social Choice Equity Fund.

TIAA-CREF Life provides mortality and expense guarantees to VLI-1, for which it 
is compensated. TIAA-CREF Life also guarantees that expense charges to VLI-1    
participants will never rise above the maximum amount stipulated in the         
contract.                                                                       

Other than the guarantees mentioned above, TIAA-CREF Life does not make any     
guarantees to policyholders on its separate accounts (including the investment

NOTE 8. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                    

Beginning January 1, 1998, TIAA-CREF Life began filing a consolidated federal   
income tax return with its parent and its affiliates. The consolidated group has
entered into a tax-sharing agreement that follows the current reimbursement     
method, whereby members of the group will generally be reimbursed for their     
losses on a pro-rata basis by other members of the group to the extent that they
have taxable income, subject to the limitations imposed under the Internal      
Revenue Code, ("Code"). Amounts payable to or (due from) TIAA, included in Other
Liabilities on the Statutory -- Basis Balance Sheet, for federal income taxes   
were $600 and ($1,000) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.             

The components of TIAA-CREF Life's net deferred tax asset were as follows:      

                                                                [Download Table]

Change in non-admitted deferred tax assets                    $11,345

TIAA-CREF Life's gross deferred tax assets were primarily attributable to       
differences in required reserves and the capitalization of acquisition costs    
required by the Code.                                                           

TIAA-CREF Life has no deferred tax liabilities that have not been recognized.   

The components of TIAA-CREF Life's income taxes incurred and the change in      
deferred tax assets and liabilities were, as follows:

Individual Deferred Variable Annuity Contract                                   

Funded Through                                                                  

TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 of TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company        

April 1, 1999                                                                   

This prospectus describes information you should know before investing in the   
Personal Annuity Select, an individual deferred variable annuity contract       
offered by TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company (TIAA-CREF Life) and funded through 
the TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 (the separate account). Read it        
carefully before investing, and keep it for future reference.                   

The contract is designed for individual investors who desire to accumulate      
funds on a tax-deferred basis for retirement or other long-term investment      
purposes, and to receive future payment of those funds as lifetime income or    
through other payment options. Whether the contract is available to you is      
subject to approval by regulatory authorities in your state.                    

Contractowners may allocate premiums either to the separate account, which      
currently has one investment account invested in the Stock Index Fund of the    
TIAA-CREF Life Funds, or to a TIAA-CREF Life fixed account, or both.            

As with all variable annuities, your accumulation in the variable component of  
your contract can increase or decrease, depending on how well the investment    
account, the Stock Index Fund, performs over time. TIAA-CREF Life doesn't       
guarantee the investment performance of the Stock Index Fund, and you bear the  
entire investment risk.                                                         

More information about the separate account and the variable component of the   
contract is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a      
"Statement of Additional Information" (SAI) dated April 1, 1999. You can        
receive a free SAI by writing us at TIAA-CREF Life, 730 Third Avenue, New York, 
New York 10017-3206 (attention: Central Services), or by calling 800 842-2733,  
extension 5509. The SAI is "incorporated by reference" into the prospectus;     
that means it's legally part of the prospectus. The SAI's table of contents is  
on the last page of this prospectus. The SEC maintains a Website (www.sec.gov)  
that contains the SAI, material incorporated by reference and other information 
regarding the separate account.                                                 

This prospectus must be accompanied or preceded by a current prospectus or      
profile for the TIAA-CREF Life Funds.                                           

Although we have registered these securities with the SEC, the SEC has not      
judged them for investment merit and does not guarantee that the information in 
this prospectus is accurate or adequate. Anyone who suggests otherwise is       
committing a federal crime.                                                     

An investment in the contract is not a deposit of the TIAA-CREF Trust Company,  
FSB, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance          
Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Summary                                                                         

Read this summary together with the detailed information you'll find in the

What is the Personal Annuity Select variable annuity contract?                  

The contract is an individual, flexible premium (you can contribute varying     
amounts) deferred annuity, whose variable component is funded by the TIAA-CREF  
Life Separate Account VA-1, a separate investment account of TIAA-CREF Life.    
The contract accepts only after-tax dollars (i.e., your contributions can't be  
excluded from your gross income for tax purposes). It is available to you       
subject to applicable state regulatory approval.                                

Currently, the separate account has only one investment account, which invests  
in shares of the Stock Index Fund of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. The value of     
accumulation units credited to your contract and the amount of the variable     
annuity payments depend on the investment experience of the Stock Index Fund.   
TIAA-CREF Life does not guarantee the investment performance of the separate    
account. Thus, you bear the full investment risk for all amounts contributed to 
the separate account.                                                           

Like earnings from other annuity products, earnings on your accumulations in    
the separate account aren't taxed until withdrawn or paid as annuity income.

(1) Several states assess premium taxes on premiums paid under the contract.    
Where TIAA-CREF Life is required to pay this premium tax, it may deduct 
the amount of the premium tax paid from any premium payment. In the     
 remaining states that assess premium taxes, a deduction will be made only
upon annuitization, death of the owner, or surrender. See "Other Charges
and Expenses," page 17.                                                 

(2) Although the total separate account charges stated under the contract are   
1.20% per year, TIAA-CREF Life has waived these charges to 0.30%.       
  TIAA-CREF Life will provide at least three months' notice before it raises
these charges.                                                          
(3) Although Teachers Advisors, Inc. (Advisors), the Stock Index Fund's         
investment adviser, is entitled to an annual fee of 0.30% of the fund's 
 average daily net assets, it has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of
its fee. If Teachers Advisors imposed the full amount of its fee, total 
annual expenses payable under the contract would be 0.60%, assuming     
continued waiver of separate account charges.                           
(4) If TIAA-CREF Life and Advisors imposed the full amount of the               
  administrative expense, mortality and expense risk and investment advisory
charges, total annual expenses would be 1.50%.                          

We will provide at least three months' notice before we raise any of these      
charges.

The next table gives an example of the expenses you'd incur on a hypothetical   
investment of $1,000 in the Stock Index Fund investment account offered under   
your contract over several periods. The table assumes a 5% annual return on     
assets and that the current fee waivers are in place.                           

                                                                [Download Table]

If you withdraw your entire accumulation at                           
the end of the applicable time period:                  $4      $12

If you annuitize at the end of the applicable                         
time period:                                            $4      $12

These tables are to help you understand the various expenses you would bear     
directly or indirectly as an owner of a contract. Remember that they don't      
represent actual past or future expenses or investment performance. Actual      
expenses may be higher or lower. For more information, see "Charges," page 16.  

How do I purchase a contract?                                                   

To purchase a contract, you must complete an application and make an initial    
payment of at least $250, or $25 under an automatic investment plan using       
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Additional contributions must be at least $25. 
For details, see "Purchasing a Contract and Remitting Premiums," page 12.       

Can I cancel my contract?                                                       

You can examine the contract and return it to TIAA-CREF Life for a refund,      
until the end of the "free look" period specified in your contract (which is a  
minimum of 10 days, but varies by state). In states that permit it, we'll       
refund the accumulation value calculated on the date that you returned the      
contract and the refund request to us. (Note that the value of your initial     
premium may have gone down during the period.) In states that don't allow us to 
refund accumulation value only, we'll refund the premiums you paid to the       
contract. We will consider the contract returned on the date it's postmarked    
and properly addressed with postage pre-paid or, if it's not postmarked, on the 
day we receive it. We will send you the refund within 7 days after we get       
written notice of cancellation and the return contract. If you live             

7                                                                               

P-->4979th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 9th
in a state that requires refund of premiums, your premiums and transfers        
allocated to the separate account during the "free look" period can't exceed    
$10,000. For details, see "Purchasing a Contract and Remitting Premiums," page  
12.                                                                             

Can I transfer or make cash withdrawals from the contract?                      

Currently, you can transfer funds from the separate (variable) account to the   
fixed account as often as you like, but you can transfer from the fixed account 
to the separate account no more than once every 180 days. All transfers must be 
for at least $250 or your entire account balance. All cash withdrawals must be  
for at least $1,000 or your entire account balance.                             

You may have to pay a tax penalty if you want to make a cash withdrawal before  
age 59 1/2. For more, see "Income Options," page 19, and "Federal Income Taxes,"
page 22.                                                                        

What are my options for receiving annuity payments under the contract?          

All annuity payments are currently paid out of the fixed account. The contract  
offers a variety of annuity options, including: One-Life Annuities, which pay   
income as long as you live or until the end of a specified guaranteed period,   
whichever is longer; Fixed-Period Annuities, which pay income for a period of   
between 2 and 30 years; and Two-Life Annuities, which pay income to you as long 
as you live, then continue at either the same or a reduced level for the life   
of your annuity partner or until the end of a specified guaranteed period,      
which is greater. For details, see "The Contract--The Annuity Period," page 18. 

What death benefits are available under the contract?                           

If you die before receiving annuity payments, your beneficiary can receive a    
death benefit, paid out of the fixed account. The amount of the death benefit   
will be the greater of the amounts you've accumulated in your accounts or the   
total premiums paid under your contract (less any cash withdrawals). For        
details, see "Death Benefits," page 20.

TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company and TIAA                                       

The contracts are issued by TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, a stock life      
insurance company organized under the laws of New York State on November 20,
1996. All of the stock of TIAA-CREF Life is held by TIAA-CREF Enterprises,      
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association   
of America (TIAA). TIAA-CREF Life's headquarters are at 730 Third Avenue, New
York, New York 10017-3206.                                                      

TIAA-CREF Life's parent, TIAA, is a stock life insurance company, organized     
under the laws of New York State. It was founded on March 4, 1918, by the       
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. TIAA is the companion      
organization of the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), the first company  
in the United States to issue a variable annuity. CREF is a nonprofit           
membership corporation established in New York State in 1952. Together, TIAA    
and CREF, serving approximately 2.1 million people, form the principal          
retirement system for the nation's education and research communities and the   
largest retirement system in the world, based on assets under management. As of 
December 31, 1998, TIAA's assets were approximately $102 billion; the combined  
assets for TIAA and CREF totalled approximately $248 billion (although neither  
TIAA nor CREF stands behind TIAA-CREF Life's guarantees).                       

The separate account                                                            

The separate account was established by TIAA-CREF Life as a separate investment 
account under New York law on July 27, 1998, by resolution of TIAA-CREF Life's  
Board of Directors. The separate account is registered with the SEC as a unit   
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 
Act). As part of TIAA-CREF Life, the separate account is also subject to        
regulation by the State of New York Insurance Department (NYID) and the         
insurance departments of some other jurisdictions in which the contracts are    
offered (see the SAI).                                                          

9                                                                               

P-->49711th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 11th
Although TIAA-CREF Life owns the assets of the separate account, and the        
obligations under the contracts are obligations of TIAA-CREF Life, the separate 
account's income, investment gains, and investment losses are credited to or    
charged against the assets of the separate account without regard to TIAA-CREF  
Life's other income, gains, or losses. Under New York law, we cannot charge the 
separate account with liabilities incurred by any other TIAA-CREF Life separate 
account or other business activity TIAA-CREF Life may undertake.                

Currently the separate account has only one investment account, which invests   
in shares of the Stock Index Fund (fund) of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. The fund  
is described briefly below.                                                     

TIAA-CREF Life Funds--the Stock Index Fund                                      

General                                                                         

TIAA-CREF Life Funds is an open-end management investment company that was      
organized as a business trust under Delaware law on August 13, 1998. The        
TIAA-CREF Life Funds currently consists of a single investment portfolio--the   
Stock Index Fund--but may add other portfolios in the future.                   

Stock Index Fund                                                                

The investment objective of the Stock Index Fund is favorable long-term return  
from a diversified portfolio selected to track the overall market for common    
stocks publicly traded in the U.S., as represented by a broad stock market      
index. The Stock Index Fund attempts to track the U.S. stock market as a whole  
by investing substantially all of its assets in a sampling of stocks included in
the Russell 3000[RegTM] index, an index consisting of the 3,000 largest         
publicly-traded U.S. corporations. It also uses certain proprietary quantitative
scoring and trading techniques to attempt to slightly outperform the index.     

Like any portfolio that the TIAA-CREF Life Funds might add in the future, the   
Stock Index Fund's current portfolio is subject to the risks involved in        
professional investment management, including those resulting from general      
economic conditions. The value of your accumulation, as in any investment       
portfolio, can fluctuate and you bear the entire risk.                          

10

The investment objective, techniques and restrictions of the TIAA-CREF Life     
Funds are described fully in its prospectus and SAI. A copy of the prospectus   
or a profile of that prospectus accompanies this prospectus. The prospectus and 
SAI of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds may be obtained by writing TIAA-CREF Life       
Funds, 730 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017-3206, or by calling 800       
842-2733, extension 5509. You should read the prospectus for the TIAA-CREF Life 
Funds carefully before investing in the separate account.                       

Investment Management                                                           

Teachers Advisors, Inc. (Advisors), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of      
TIAA, manages the assets of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. Personnel of Advisors     
also manage the Stock Index Account of the TIAA Separate Account VA-1, as well  
as TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds. They also manage the CREF accounts on behalf of      
TIAA-CREF Investment Management, LLC, an investment adviser which is also a     
TIAA subsidiary.                                                                

Voting Rights                                                                   

The separate account is the legal owner of the shares of the TIAA-CREF Life     
Funds offered through your contract and as such, has the right to vote its      
shares at any meeting of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds' shareholders, although the   
fund doesn't plan to hold annual meetings of shareholders. If and when          
shareholder meetings are held, we will give you the right to instruct us how to 
vote the shares that are attributable to your contract. Shares as to which no   
timely instructions are received will be voted by TIAA-CREF Life in the same    
proportion as the voting instructions which are received with respect to all    
contracts. TIAA-CREF Life may vote the shares of the fund in its own right in   
some cases, if it determines that it is legally permitted to do so.             

The number of fund shares attributable to each contractowner is determined by   
dividing the contractowner's interest in the applicable investment account by   
the net asset value of the fund.                                                

11

Adding and closing accounts or substituting investment portfolios               

We can add new investment accounts in the future that would invest in other     
fund portfolios or other funds. We don't guarantee that the separate account,   
or any investment account added in the future, will always be available. We     
reserve the right to add or close accounts, substitute one investment portfolio 
for another, or combine accounts or investment portfolios. We can also make any 
changes to the separate account or to the contract required by applicable laws. 
TIAA-CREF Life can make some changes at its discretion, subject to NYID and SEC 
approval as required. The separate account can (i) operate under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 as an investment company, or in any other form permitted by 
law, (ii) deregister under the 1940 Act if registration is no longer required,  
or (iii) combine with other separate accounts. As permitted by law, TIAA-CREF   
Life may transfer the separate account assets to another separate account or    
account of TIAA-CREF Life or another insurance company or transfer the contract 
to another insurance company.                                                   

The contract--the accumulation period                                           

The contract is an individual flexible-premium (you can contribute varying      
amounts) deferred annuity that accepts only after-tax dollars. The rights and   
benefits under the variable component of the contract are summarized below;     
however, the descriptions you read here are qualified entirely by the contract  
itself. We plan on offering the contract in all fifty states, the District of   
Columbia and the United States Virgin Islands, although currently the contract  
will not be available to residents in those states where we are awaiting        
regulatory approval.

Initial premiums must be for at least $250. However, you may establish an       
automatic investment plan using electronic funds transfers with a minimum       
investment of $25 by completing an authorization form. (The initial payment     
must be made by check.) We will credit your initial premium within two business 
days after we receive all necessary information or the premium itself,          
whichever is later. If we don't have the necessary information within five      
business days, we'll return your initial premium unless you instruct us         
otherwise upon being contacted.                                                 

Additional Premiums. Subsequent premiums must be for at least $25. Send a       
check, payable to TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, along with a personalized   
payment coupon (supplied upon purchasing a contract) to:                        

TIAA-CREF                                                         
P.O. Box 95919                                                    
Chicago, IL 60694-5919                                            

If you don't have a coupon, use a separate piece of paper to give us your name, 
address and contract number. These premiums will be credited as of the business 
day we receive them. Currently, TIAA-CREF Life will accept premiums at any time 
both the contractowner and the annuitant are living and your contract is in the 
accumulation period. However, we reserve the right not to accept premiums under 
this contract after you have been given three months' notice.                   

Electronic Payment. You may make initial or subsequent investments by           
electronic payment. A federal wire is usually received the same day and an ACH  
is usually received by the second day after transmission. Be aware that your    
bank may charge you a fee to wire funds, although ACH is usually less expensive 
than a federal wire. Here's what you need to do:                                

1. If you are sending in an initial premium, send us your application;          

2. Instruct your bank to wire money to:

3. Specify on the wire:                                                         
[ ]   Your name, address and Social                                 
Security Number(s) or Taxpayer                          
Identification Number                                   
[ ]   Indicate if this is for a new application or existing contract
(provide contract number if existing)                   

Certain Restrictions. Except as described below, the contract doesn't restrict  
how large your premiums are or how often you send them, although we reserve the 
right to impose restrictions in the future. Your total premiums and transfers   
to the separate

In addition, total premiums and transfers to the fixed account in any 12-month  
period could be limited to $300,000. Call us for more information.              

Accumulation Units                                                              

The premiums you allocate to the separate (variable) account purchase           
accumulation units. We calculate how many accumulation units to credit by       
dividing the amount allocated to the particular investment account of the       
separate account by its accumulation unit value for the business day when we    
received your premium. We may use a later business day for your initial         
premium. To determine how many accumulation units to subtract for transfers and 
cash withdrawals, we use the unit value for the business day when we receive    
your completed transaction request and all required information and documents   
(unless you've chosen a later date).                                            

The value of the accumulation units will depend mainly on the investment        
experience of the underlying investment fund, though the unit value reflects    
expense deductions from assets (see "Charges," page 16). We calculate the unit  
value at the close of each valuation day. We multiply the previous day's unit   
value by the net investment factor for the pertinent investment account of the  
separate account. The net investment factor reflects, for the most part,        
changes in the net asset value of the shares of the fund held by the investment 
account, and investment income and capital gains distributed to the investment  
account. The net investment factor is decreased by the separate account's       
expense and risk charges.

The Fixed Account                                                               

This prospectus provides information mainly about the contract's variable       
component. Following is a brief description of the fixed account.               

You can allocate premiums to the fixed account or transfer from the separate    
account to the fixed account at any time. Premiums allocated and amounts        
transferred to the fixed account become part of the general account assets of   
TIAA-CREF Life, which support various insurance and annuity obligations. The    
general account includes all the assets of TIAA-CREF Life, except those in the  
separate account or in any other TIAA-CREF Life separate investment account.    
Interests in the fixed account have not been registered under the Securities    
Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act), nor is the fixed account registered as an           
investment company under the 1940 Act. Neither the fixed account nor any        
interests therein are generally subject to the 1933 Act or 1940 Act.            

Currently, TIAA-CREF Life guarantees that amounts in the fixed account will     
earn interest of at least 3 percent per year. At its discretion, TIAA-CREF Life 
can credit amounts in the fixed account with interest at a higher rate than 3   
percent per year.                                                               

For details about the fixed account, see your contract.                         

Transfers                                                                       

You can transfer some (at least $250 at a time) or all of the amount            
accumulated under your contract between the separate account and the fixed      
account, and, if additional investment accounts are added, among the separate   
account's investment accounts. Transfers to the fixed account begin             
participating on the day following effectiveness of the transfer (see below).   
Currently, we don't charge you for transfers or limit the number of transfers   
from the separate account. We reserve the right to limit transfers in the       
future to one every 90 days, provided we give you three months' notice.         
Transfers from the fixed account to the separate account are limited to once    
every 180 days. TIAA-CREF Life may defer payment of a transfer from the fixed   
account for up to six months.                                                   

Cash Withdrawals                                                                

You can withdraw some or all of your accumulation in the separate account as    
cash. Cash withdrawals must be for at least $1,000 (or your entire              
accumulation, if less). We reserve the right to cancel any contract where no    
premiums have been paid to either the separate account or the fixed account for 
three years and your total amount in the separate account and the fixed account 
falls below $250. Currently, there's no charge for cash withdrawals.            

15                                                                              

P-->49717th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 17th
If you withdraw your entire accumulation in the separate account and the fixed  
account, we'll cancel your contract and all of our obligations to you under the 
contract will end.                                                              

General Considerations for All Transfers and Cash Withdrawals                   

You can tell us how much you want to transfer or withdraw in dollars,           
accumulation units, or as a percentage of your accumulation.                    

Transfers and cash withdrawals are effective at the end of the business day we  
receive your request and any required information and documentation. Transfers  
and cash withdrawals made at any time other than during a business day will be  
effective at the close of the next business day. You can also defer the         
effective date of a transfer or cash withdrawal to a future business day        
acceptable to us.                                                               

To request a transfer, write to TIAA-CREF Life's home office, call our          
Automated Telephone Service at 800 842-2252 (there is an option to speak with a 
live person, if you wish), or use our Inter/ACT service over the Internet at    
www.tiaa-cref.org. If you make a telephone or Internet transfer at any time     
other than during a business day, it will be effective at the close of the next 
business day. We can suspend or terminate your ability to transfer by telephone 
or over the Internet at any time.                                               

Tax Issues                                                                      

Make sure you understand the possible federal and other income tax consequences 
of transfers and cash withdrawals. Cash withdrawals are usually taxed at the    
rates for ordinary income--i.e., they are not treated as capital gains.         
Withdrawals before age 591/2 may subject you to early-distribution taxes as     
well. For details, see "Federal Income Taxes," page 22.                         

Charges                                                                         

Separate Account Charges                                                        

Charges are deducted each valuation day from the assets of the separate account 
for various services required to administer the separate account and the        
contracts and to cover certain insurance risks borne by TIAA-CREF Life. Total   
separate account charges                                                        

16                                                                              

P-->49718th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 18th
(i.e., administrative expense and mortality and expense risk charges) allowable 
under the contract are 1.20 percent of net assets annually. TIAA-CREF Life has  
waived a portion of these charges so that current charges total 0.30 percent of 
net assets annually. While TIAA-CREF Life reserves the right to increase the    
separate account charges at any time, we will provide at least three months'    
notice before any raise. TIAA-CREF Life itself provides the administrative      
services for the separate account and the contracts and expects that expense    
charges will remain relatively low.                                             

Administrative Expense Charge. This charge is for administration and            
operations, such as allocating premiums and administering accumulations. The    
current daily deduction is equivalent to 0.20 percent of net assets annually.   

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. TIAA-CREF Life imposes a daily charge as     
compensation for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with 
the contract. The current daily deduction is equal to 0.10 percent of net       
assets annually.                                                                

TIAA-CREF Life's mortality risks come from its contractual obligations to make  
annuity payments and to pay death benefits before the annuity starting date.    
This assures that neither your own longevity nor any collective increase in     
life expectancy will lower the amount of your annuity payments. TIAA-CREF Life  
also bears a risk in connection with its death benefit guarantee, since a death 
benefit may exceed the actual amount of an accumulation at the time when it's   
payable.                                                                        

TIAA-CREF Life's expense risk is the possibility that TIAA-CREF Life's actual   
expenses for administering the contract and the separate account will exceed    
the amount recovered through the administrative expense deduction.              

If the mortality and expense risk charge allowable under the contract isn't     
enough to cover TIAA-CREF Life's actual costs, TIAA-CREF Life will absorb the   
deficit. On the other hand, if the charge more than covers costs, the excess    
will belong to TIAA-CREF Life. TIAA-CREF Life will pay a fee from its general   
account assets, which may include amounts derived from the mortality and        
expense risk charge, to Teachers Personal Investors Services, Inc. (TPIS), the  
principal underwriter of the variable component of the contract for             
distribution of the variable component of the contract.                         

Other Charges and Expenses                                                      

Fund Expenses. Certain deductions and expenses of the fund are paid out of the  
assets of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds. These expenses include charges for          
investment advice, portfolio accounting, custodial, and                         

17                                                                              

P-->49719th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
similar services provided for the fund, as well as brokers' commissions,        
transfer taxes, and other portfolio fees. The investment management agreement   
between Advisors and the TIAA-CREF Life Funds sets the investment advisory fee  
for the Stock Index Fund at 0.30 percent annually. Currently, Advisors has      
agreed to waive a portion of that fee, so that the daily deduction is           
equivalent to 0.07 percent of net assets annually. For a complete discussion of 
fund deductions and expenses, read the fund prospectus.                         

No Deductions from Premiums. The contract provides for no front-end charges.    

Premium Taxes. Currently, contracts issued to residents of several states and   
the District of Columbia are subject to a premium tax. Charges for premium      
taxes on a particular contract ordinarily will be deducted from the             
accumulation when it's applied to provide annuity payments. However, if a       
jurisdiction requires that premium taxes be paid at other times, such as when   
premiums are paid or when cash withdrawals are taken, we'll deduct premium      
taxes at those times. Current state premium taxes, where charged, range from    
1.00 percent to 3.50 percent of premium payments.                               

The contract--the annuity period

The Annuity Period                                                              

All annuity payments are paid to the contractowner from the fixed account.      
(Annuity payments may be available from the separate account in the future.)    
TIAA-CREF Life fixed annuity payments are usually monthly. You can choose       
quarterly, semi-annual, and annual payments as well. The total value of annuity 
payments made may be more or less than total premiums paid by the               
contractowner.                                                                  

Your payments are based on the value of the accumulation in your contract       
determined at the end of the last calendar day of the month before the annuity  
starting date. We transfer your separate account accumulation to the fixed      
account on that day. At the annuity starting date, the dollar amount of each    
periodic annuity payment resulting from your separate account accumulation is   
fixed, based upon the number and value of the separate account accumulation     
units being converted to annuity income, the annuity option chosen, the ages of 

18                                                                              

P-->49720th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 20th
the annuitant and any annuity partner, and the annuity purchase rates. Payments 
are not variable--they won't change based on the investment experience of the   
separate account. After the end of the accumulation period, your contract will  
no longer participate in the separate account.                                  

Technically all benefits are payable at TIAA-CREF Life's home office, but, as   
you instruct, we'll send your annuity payments by mail to your home address or  
(on your request) by mail or electronic fund transfer to your bank. If the      
address or bank where you want your payments sent changes, it's your            
responsibility to let us know. We can send payments to your residence or bank   
abroad, although there are some countries where the U.S. Treasury Department    
imposes restrictions.                                                           

Annuity Starting Date                                                           

Generally you pick an annuity starting date (it has to be the first day of a    
month) when you first apply for a contract. If you don't, we'll tentatively     
assume the annuity starting date will be the latest permissible annuity         
starting date (i.e., the first day of the month of the annuitant's ninetieth    
birthday). You can change the annuity starting date at any time before annuity  
payments begin (see "Choices and Changes," page 26) . In any case, the annuity  
starting date cannot be earlier than fourteen months after the date your        
contract is issued.                                                             

For payments to begin on the annuity starting date, we must have received all   
information and documentation necessary for the income option you've picked. If 
we haven't received all the necessary information, we'll defer the annuity      
starting date until the first day of the month after the information has        
reached us, but not beyond the latest permissible annuity starting date. If, by 
the latest permissible annuity starting date, you haven't picked an income      
option or if we have not otherwise received all the necessary information, we   
will begin payments under a One-Life Annuity with, in most cases, a ten year    
guaranteed period. Your first annuity check may be delayed while we process     
your choice of income options and calculate the amount of your initial payment. 

Income Options                                                                  

You have a number of different annuity options. The current options are:        

[ ] One-Life Annuities with or without Guaranteed Period. Pays income as long as
you or your annuitant lives. If you opt for a guaranteed period (10, 15 or 20   
years) and you or your annuitant dies before it's over, income payments will    
continue to your beneficiary until the end of the period. If you don't opt for  
a guaranteed period, all payments end at your death--so that it's possible for  
you to receive only one payment if you die less than a month after payments     
start.                                                                          

19                                                                              

P-->49721st Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 21st
[ ] Fixed-Period Annuities. Pays income (usually monthly) for a stipulated      
period of not less than two nor more than thirty years. At the end of the period
you've chosen, payments stop. If you die before the period is up, your          
beneficiary becomes the contractowner.                                          

[ ] Two-Life Annuities with or without Guaranteed Period. Pays income to you as 
long as you live, then continues at either the same or a reduced level for the  
life of your annuity partner, or until the end of the specified guaranteed      
period, whichever period is longer. There are three types of two-life annuity   
options, all available with or without a guaranteed period--Full Benefit to     
Survivor, Two-Thirds Benefit to Survivor, and a Half-Benefit to Annuity Partner.

We may make variable income options available in the future.                    

Death benefits                                                                  

Availability; Choosing Beneficiaries                                            

Death benefits are available if you or the annuitant die during the             
accumulation period. When you fill out an application for a contract, you name  
one or more beneficiaries to receive the death benefit if you die. You can      
change your beneficiary at any time during the accumulation period (see         
"Choices and Changes," page 26). For more information on designating            
beneficiaries, contact TIAA-CREF Life or your legal advisor.                    

Special Option for Spouses                                                      

If your spouse is the sole beneficiary when you die, your spouse can choose to  
become the contractowner and continue the contract, or receive the death        
benefit. If your spouse does not make a choice within 60 days after we receive  
proof of death, your spouse will automatically become the contractowner. Your   
spouse will also become the annuitant if you were the annuitant.                

20

Payment of Death Benefit                                                        

Death benefits are paid out of the fixed account. Your accumulation will        
continue participating in the investment experience of the separate account     
until we authorize payment of the death benefit. We will transfer your separate 
account accumulation to the fixed account as of the date we authorize payment   
of the death benefit.                                                           

To authorize payment and pay a death benefit, TIAA-CREF Life must have received 
all necessary forms and documentation, including proof of death and the         
selection of the method of payment. Even if we have not received all of the     
required information, death benefits must begin by the first day of the month   
following the 60th day after we receive proof of death. If no method of payment 
has been chosen by that time, we'll have the option of paying the entire death  
benefit to the death benefit beneficiary within five years of death, using the  
Fixed-Period Annuity method.                                                    

Amount of Death Benefit                                                         

The amount of the death benefit will equal the greater of:                      

(1) the amount you have accumulated in the separate and fixed accounts on the   
day we authorize payment of the death benefit, or                       

(2) the total premiums paid under your contract minus any cash withdrawals (or  
any surrender charges on cash withdrawals.                              

If (2) is greater than (1), we'll deposit the difference in the fixed account   
as of the day we authorize payment of the death benefit.                        

Methods of Payment of Death Benefits                                            

You can choose in advance the method by which we'll pay death benefits. The     
level of death benefits received will depend on the method of payment selected. 
You can block your beneficiaries from changing the method you've chosen or you  
can leave the choice to them. The method of payment you've chosen can be        
changed by notifying us in writing, provided death benefits haven't yet         
started.                                                                        

TIAA-CREF Life limits the methods of payment for death benefits to those        
suitable under federal income tax law for annuity contracts. With methods       
offering periodic payments, benefits are usually monthly, but the death benefit 
beneficiary can request to receive them quarterly, semiannually, or annually    
instead. At present, the methods of payment for TIAA-CREF Life death benefits   
are:                                                                            

[ ] Single-Sum Payment. The entire death benefit is paid at once. When the      
beneficiary is an estate, the single-sum method is automatic, and TIAA-CREF     
Life reserves the right                                                         

21                                                                              

P-->49723rd Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 23rd
to pay death benefits only as a single sum to any beneficiary that is not a     
natural person.                                                                 

[ ] One-Life Annuities with or without Guaranteed Period. Payable monthly for   
the life of the death benefit beneficiary or through a specified guaranteed     
period, whichever is longer.                                                    

[ ] Fixed-Period Annuities. Payable over two to thirty years, as determined by  
you or your beneficiary.                                                        

The One-Life Annuities are available only if the death benefit beneficiary is a 
natural person. We reserve the right to require a change in choice if the       
chosen method results in payments of less than $100.                            

Timing of payments                                                              

Usually we'll make the following kinds of payments from the separate account    
within seven calendar days after we've received the information we need to      
process a request:                                                              

1. Cash withdrawals;                                                            

2. Transfers to the fixed account; and                                          

3. Death benefits.                                                              

We can extend the seven-day period only if (1) the New York Stock Exchange is   
closed (or trading restricted by the SEC) on a day that isn't a weekend or      
holiday; (2) an SEC-recognized emergency makes it impractical for us to sell    
securities or determine the value of assets in the separate account; or (3) the 
SEC says by order that we can or must postpone payments to protect you and      
other separate account contractowners.                                          

Federal income taxes                                                            

The following discussion is based on our understanding of current federal income
tax law, and is subject to change. For complete information on your personal tax
situation, check with a qualified tax advisor.

Taxation of Annuities                                                           

The following discussion assumes the contracts qualify as annuity contracts for 
federal income tax purposes (see the SAI for more information):                 

In General. IRC section 72 governs annuity taxation generally. We believe an    
owner who is a natural person usually won't be taxed on increases in the value  
of a contract until there is a distribution (i.e., the owner withdraws all or   
part of the accumulation or takes annuity payments). Assigning, pledging, or    
agreeing to assign or pledge any part of the accumulation usually will be       
considered a distribution. Withdrawals of accumulated investment earnings are   
taxable as ordinary income. Generally under the IRC, withdrawals are first      
allocated to investment earnings.                                               

The owner of any annuity contract who is not a natural person (such as a        
corporation or a trust) generally must include in income any increase in the    
excess of the accumulation over the "investment in the contract" during the     
taxable year. There are some exceptions to this, and agents of prospective      
owners that are not natural persons may wish to discuss them with a competent   
tax advisor.                                                                    

The following discussion applies generally to contracts owned by a natural      
person:                                                                         

Withdrawals. If you withdraw funds from your contract before the annuity        
starting date, IRC section 72(e) usually deems taxable any amounts received to  
the extent that the accumulation value at the time you withdraw exceeds your    
investment in the contract. The investment in the contract usually equals all   
premiums paid by the contractowner or on the contractowner's behalf.            

If you withdraw your entire accumulation under a contract, you will be taxed    
only on the part that exceeds your investment in the contract.                  

Annuity Payments. Although tax consequences can vary with the income option you 
pick, IRC section 72(b) provides generally that, before you recover the         
investment in the contract, gross income does not include that fraction of any  
annuity income payments that equals the ratio of investment in the contract to  
the expected return at the annuity starting date. After you recover your        
investment in the contract, all additional annuity payments are fully taxable.  

Taxation of Death Benefit Proceeds. Amounts may be paid from a contract because 
an owner has died. If the payments are made in a single sum, they're taxed the  
same way a full withdrawal from the contract is taxed. If they are distributed  
as annuity payments, they're taxed as annuity payments.                         

23                                                                              

P-->49725th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
Penalty Tax on Some Withdrawals. You may have to pay a penalty tax (10 percent  
of the amount treated as taxable income) on some withdrawals. However, there is 
usually no penalty on distributions:                                            

(1) on or after you reach 591/2;                                                

(2) after you die (or after the annuitant dies, if the owner isn't an           
individual);                                                            

(3) after you become disabled; or                                               

(4) that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic (at least annual) 
payments for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint
life expectancies) of you and your beneficiary.                         

Possible Tax Changes. Legislation is proposed from time to time that would      
change the taxation of annuity contracts. It is possible that such legislation  
could be enacted and that it could be retroactive (that is, effective prior to  
the date of the change). You should consult a tax adviser regarding legislative 
developments and their effect on the contract.                                  

Transfers, Assignments or Exchanges of a Contract                               

Transferring contract ownership, designating an annuitant, payee or other       
beneficiary who is not also the owner, or exchanging a contract can have other  
tax consequences that we don't discuss here. If you're thinking about any of    
those transactions, contact a tax advisor.                                      

Withholding                                                                     

Annuity distributions usually are subject to withholding for the recipient's    
federal income tax liability at rates that vary according to the type of        
distribution and the recipient's tax status. However, recipients can usually    
choose not to have tax withheld from distributions.                             

Multiple Contracts                                                              

In determining gross income, section 72(e) generally treats as one contract all 
TIAA-CREF Life and TIAA non-qualified deferred annuity contracts to the same    
owner during any calendar year. This could affect when income is taxable and    
how much might be subject to the 10 percent penalty tax (see above). Consult a  
tax advisor before buying more than one annuity contract for the purpose of     
gaining a tax advantage.                                                        

Possible Charge for TIAA-CREF Life's Taxes                                      

Currently we don't charge the separate account for any federal, state, or local 
taxes on it or its contracts (other than premium taxes--see page 18), but we    
reserve the                                                                     

24

right to charge the separate account or the contracts for any tax or other cost 
resulting from the tax laws that we believe should be attributed to them.       

Tax Advice                                                                      

What we tell you here about federal and other taxes isn't comprehensive and is  
for general information only. It doesn't cover every situation. Taxation varies 
depending on the circumstances, and state and local taxes may also be involved. 
For complete information on your personal tax situation, check with a qualified 
tax advisor.

Performance information                                                         

Condensed Financial Information                                                 

The separate account has just recently commenced operations. Therefore no       
condensed financial information is included in the prospectus. The financial    
statements for TIAA-CREF Life are in the SAI, which is available free upon      
request.                                                                        

Performance Information                                                         

We may advertise the total return and average annual total return of the        
separate account. "Total return" means the cumulative percentage increase or    
decrease in the value of an investment over standard one-, five-, and ten-year  
periods (and occasionally other periods as well).                               

"Average annual total return" means the annually compounded rate that would     
result in the same cumulative total return over the stated period.              

All performance figures are based on past investment results. They aren't a     
guarantee that the separate account will perform equally or similarly in the    
future. Write or call us for current performance figures for the separate       
account.

General matters

Choices and Changes                                                             

You can choose or change any of the following prior to receiving annuity        
income: (1) an annuity starting date; (2) an income option; (3) a transfer; (4) 
a method of payment for death benefits; (5) an annuity partner, beneficiary, or 
other person named to receive payments; and (6) a cash withdrawal or other      
distribution. You have to make your choices or changes via a written notice     
satisfactory to us and received at our home office (see below). You can change  
the terms of a transfer, cash withdrawal, or other cash distribution only       
before they're scheduled to take place. When we receive a notice of a change in 
beneficiary or other person named to receive payments, we'll execute the change 
as of the date it was signed, even if the signer dies in the meantime. We       
execute all other changes as of the date received.                              

Telephone and Internet Transactions                                             

You can use our Automated Telephone Service (ATS) or our Inter/ACT system over  
the Internet to check your accumulation balances and/or your current allocation 
percentages, transfer between the separate account and the fixed account,       
and/or allocate future premiums to the separate account or the fixed account.   
You will be asked to enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN) and Social 
Security number for both systems. Both will lead you through the transaction    
process and will use reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions given   
are genuine. All transactions made over the ATS and Inter/ACT are               
electronically recorded.                                                        

To use the ATS, you need a touch-tone phone. The toll free number for the ATS   
is 800 842-2252. To use Inter/ACT, access the TIAA-CREF Internet home page at   
www.tiaa-cref.org.                                                              

We can suspend or terminate your ability to transact by telephone or over the   
Internet at any time.

To cut costs and eliminate duplicate documents sent to your home, we may, if    
the SEC allows, begin mailing only one copy of the separate account prospectus, 
prospectus supplements, annual and semi-annual reports, or any other required   
documents, to your household, even if more than one contractowner lives there.  
If you would prefer to continue receiving your own copy of any of these         
documents, you may call us toll-free at 800 842-2733, extension 5509, or write  
us.                                                                             

Signature Requirements                                                          

For some transactions, we may require your signature to be notarized or         
guaranteed by a commercial bank or a member of a national securities exchange.  

Errors or Omissions

Year 2000 Issues                                                                

Like all financial and business organizations, TIAA-CREF Life, the separate     
account, the TIAA-CREF Life Funds and their service providers depend on the     
smooth functioning of computer systems to operate. The separate account's       
operations, including the servicing of contractowners, could be affected if     
these computer systems fail or incorrectly process or calculate date-related    
information on or after January 1, 2000.                                        

We are dedicated to providing uninterrupted, high-quality service before,       
during, and after the Year 2000. To achieve this goal, we, along with TIAA,     
have developed and have been actively carrying out an extensive Year 2000 plan  
to remediate, test and certify our internal computer systems, and to verify, to 
the extent possible, that our external service providers and the TIAA-CREF Life 
Funds will be ready for the Year 2000. While we have taken steps we believe     
reasonably address the Year 2000 problem, we can't guarantee complete success   
or eliminate the possibility that interaction with outside computer systems     
could affect our operations. If the systems we rely upon do fail or produce     
faulty data, there could be delays in properly processing transactions, or we   
may be unable temporarily to engage in normal business activities. Also,        
performance could be affected if a systems failure at a company or government   
entity affects the price of securities the TIAA-CREF Life Funds' Stock Index    
Fund owns.

Distribution of the contracts                                                   

The contracts are offered continuously by Teachers Personal Investors Services, 
Inc. (TPIS) and, in some instances, TIAA-CREF Individual & Institutional        
Services, Inc. (Services), subsidiaries of TIAA which are both registered with  
the SEC as broker-dealers and are members of the NASD. TPIS may be considered   
the "principal underwriter" for interests in the contract. Anyone distributing  
the contract must be a registered representative of either TPIS or Services,    
whose main offices are both at 730 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017-3206. 
No commissions are paid in connection with the distribution of the contracts.   

Legal proceedings                                                               

Neither the separate account, TIAA-CREF Life, TPIS, Services nor Advisors is    
involved in any legal action that we consider material to the separate account.

Tax Status of the Contract                                                      

Diversification Requirements. Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
and the regulations under it provide that separate account investments          
underlying a contract must be "adequately diversified" for it to qualify as an  
annuity contract under IRC section 72. The separate account intends to comply   
with the diversification requirements of the regulations under section 817(h).  
This will affect how we make investments.                                       

Under the IRC, you could be considered the owner of the assets of the separate  
account used to support your contract. If this happens, you'd have to include   
income and gains from the separate account assets in your gross income. The IRS 
has published rulings stating that a variable contractowner will be considered  
the owner of separate account assets if the contractowner has any powers that   
the actual owner of the assets might have, such as the ability to exercise      
investment control. The Treasury Department says that the regulations on        
investment diversification don't provide guidance about when and how investor   
control of a segregated asset account's investment could cause the investor     
rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets for  
tax purposes. The Treasury Department has also stated that the IRS would issue  
regulations or rulings clarifying the "extent to which policyholders may direct 
their investments to particular accounts without being treated as owners of the 
underlying assets."                                                             

Your ownership rights under the contract are similar but not identical to those 
described by the IRS in rulings that held that contract-owners were not owners  
of separate account assets, so the IRS therefore might not rule the same way in 
your case. TIAA-CREF Life reserves the right to change the contract if          
necessary to help prevent your being considered the owner of the separate       
account's assets.                                                               

Required Distributions. To qualify as an annuity contract under section 72(s)   
of the IRC, a contract must provide that: (a) if any owner dies on or after the 
annuity starting date but before all amounts under the contract have been       
distributed, the remaining amounts will be distributed at least as quickly as   
under the method being used when the owner died; and (b) if any owner dies      
before the annuity starting date, all amounts under the contract will be        
distributed within five years of the date of death. So long as the              
distributions begin within a year of the owner's death, the IRS will consider   
these requirements satisfied for any part of the owner's interest payable to or 
for the benefit of a "designated beneficiary" and distributed over the          
beneficiary's life or over a period that cannot exceed the beneficiary's life   
expectancy. A designated beneficiary is the person the owner names to assume    
ownership when the owner dies. A designated beneficiary must be a natural       
person, but if a contractowner's spouse is the designated beneficiary, such     
spouse can continue the contract when such contractowner dies.                  

The contract is designed to comply with section 72(s). TIAA-CREF Life will      
review the contract and amend it if necessary to make sure that it continues to 
comply with the section's requirements.                                         

Performance Information                                                         

Total Return Information for the Separate Account                               

Total return quotations for the investment accounts of the separate account may 
be advertised. Total return quotations will reflect all aspects of the          
investment account's return. Average annual total returns are determined by     
finding the average annual compounded rate of return over a period that         
reflects the growth (or decline) in value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment   
made at the beginning of the period through the end of that period, according   
to the following formula:                                                       

P(1 + T)n = EV                                            

where:  P = hypothetical initial payment of $1,000                        
T = average annual total return                           
n = number of years in the period                         
    EV = ending value of the hypothetical investment at the end of
the 1, 5, or 10 year period.                    

To derive the total return quotations from this formula, the percentage net     
change in the value of the $1,000 investment from the beginning of the period   
to the end of such period ("cumulative total return") is determined. Cumulative 
total returns simply reflect the change in value of an investment over a stated 
period. Since the accumulation unit value is a "total return" unit value that   
reflects the investment experience of the particular investment account of the  
separate account and all expense deductions made against the assets of the      
separate account, the ending value, or EV, of the $1,000 hypothetical           
investment is determined by applying the percentage change in the accumulation  
unit value over the period to the hypothetical initial payment of $1,000 less   
the current deductions from premiums (0%). We then solve the equation for T to  
derive the average annual compounded rate of return for the separate account    
over the span of the period, and the resulting "total return" quotation is      
carried out to the nearest hundredth of one percent.                            

Performance Comparisons                                                         

Performance information for the separate account and its investment accounts    
may be compared, in advertisements, sales literature, and reports to            
contractowners and annuitants, to the performance information reported by other 
investments and to various indices and averages. Such comparisons may be made   
with, but are not limited to: (1) Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000 indices, (2) the 
S&P 500, (3) the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA"), (4) Lipper Analytical   
Services, Inc. Mutual Fund Performance Analysis Reports and the Lipper General  
Equity Funds Average, (5) Money Magazine Fund Watch, (6) Business Week's Mutual 
Fund Scoreboard, (7) SEI Funds Evaluation Services Equity Fund Report, (8) CDA  
Mutual Funds Performance Review and CDA Growth Mutual Fund Performance Index,   
(9) Value Line Composite Average (geometric), (10) Wilshire 5000 Equity Index,  
(11) the Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(measurement of inflation), (12) VARDS, and (13) Morningstar, Inc. We may also  
discuss ratings or rankings received from these entities, accompanied in some   
cases by an explanation of those ratings or rankings, when applicable. In       
addition, advertisements may discuss the performance of the indices listed      
above.                                                                          

B-3                                                                             

P-->49734th Page of 55TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 34th
The performance of the separate account also may be compared to other indices   
or averages that measure performance of a pertinent group of securities.        
Contractowners should keep in mind that the composition of the investments in   
the reported averages will not be identical to that of the separate account and 
that certain formula calculations (i.e., yield) may differ from index to index. 
In addition, there can be no assurance that the separate account will continue  
its performance as compared to such indices.                                    

Illustrating Compounding, Tax Deferral,                                         
and Expense Deductions                                                          

We may illustrate in advertisements, sales literature and reports to            
contractowners or annuitants the effects of tax deferral and/or compounding of  
earnings on an investment in the separate account. We may do this using a       
hypothetical investment earning a specified rate of return. To illustrate the   
effects of compounding, we would show how the total return from an investment   
of the same dollar amount, earning the same or different interest rate, varies  
depending on when the investment was made. To illustrate the effects of tax     
deferral, we will show how the total return from an investment of the same      
dollar amount, earning the same or different interest rates, for individuals in 
the same tax bracket, would vary between tax-deferred and taxable investments.  

We may also illustrate in advertisements, sales literature and reports to       
contractowners or annuitants the effect of an investment fund's expenses on     
total return over time. We may do this using a hypothetical investment earning  
a specified rate of return. We would show how the total return, net of          
expenses, from an investment of the same dollar amount in funds with the same   
investment results but different expense deductions varies increasingly over    
time. In the alternative, we would show the difference in the dollar amount of  
total expense charges paid over time by an investor in two or more different    
funds that have the same annual total return but different asset-based expense  
charges. We may also compare the separate account's expense charges to those of 
other variable annuities and other investment products.                         

Statements and Reports                                                          

You will receive a confirmation statement each time you remit premiums, or make 
a transfer or cash withdrawal to or from the separate account. The statement    
will show the date and amount of each transaction. However, if you're using an  
automatic investment plan, you'll receive a statement confirming those          
transactions immediately following the end of each calendar quarter.            

If you have any accumulations in the separate account, you will be sent a       
statement each quarter which sets forth the following:                          

(1) Premiums paid during the quarter;                                         

(2) the number and dollar value of accumulation units in the separate account 
credited to the contractowner during the quarter and in total;        

(3) cash withdrawals from the separate account during the quarter; and        

(4) any transfers between the separate account and the fixed account during   
the quarter.                                                          

You will also receive, at least semi-annually, reports containing the financial 
statements of the TIAA-CREF Life Funds and a schedule of investments held by    
the TIAA-CREF Life Funds.                                                       

General Matters                                                                 

Assignment of Contracts                                                         

You can assign the contract at any time.                                        

Payment to an Estate, Guardian, Trustee, etc.                                   

We reserve the right to pay in one sum the commuted value of any benefits due   
an estate, corporation, partnership, trustee or other entity not a natural      
person. Neither TIAA-CREF Life nor the separate account will be responsible for 
the conduct of any executor, trustee, guardian, or other third party to whom    
payment is made.                                                                

Benefits Based on Incorrect Information                                         

If the amounts of benefits provided under a contract were based on information  
that is incorrect, benefits will be recalculated on the basis of the correct    
data. If any overpayments or underpayments have been made by the separate       
account, appropriate adjustments will be made.                                  

Proof of Survival                                                               

We reserve the right to require satisfactory proof that anyone named to receive 
benefits under a contract is living on the date payment is due. If this proof

LLP, Washington, D.C., has provided advice on certain matters relating to the   
federal securities laws.                                                        

Experts                                                                         

The financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company and the separate   
account included in this Statement of Additional Information have been audited  
by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, as stated in their reports          
appearing herein, and have been so included in reliance upon the reports of     
such firm given upon their authority as experts in accounting and auditing.     
Ernst & Young LLP is located at 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019.   

Additional Considerations                                                       

Over the past several years, TIAA and CREF have added many new investment       
vehicles to their line of products. The growing family of TIAA and CREF         
products is designed to provide additional investment options for those who     
want to diversify their holdings. Most experts recommend diversification as a   
good strategy for retirement and other long-term investing, both because a      
diversified portfolio offers a degree of safety from the volatility of specific 
markets, and because it allows the investor to benefit from the potential for   
growth in several different types of investments.                               

The TIAA-CREF Life Funds' Stock Index Fund offered by the separate account is   
suited for people who are seeking growth and are able to make long-term         
investments. Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, in    
the past stocks have outperformed many other types of investments. Investors    
who seek to counter the effects of inflation on their long-term investments     
should therefore consider investing in stocks. The Stock Index Fund could be an 
appropriate investment for someone who is seeking to supplement his or her      
retirement income, to purchase a retirement home, finance an extended trip, or  
build a fund for philanthropic purposes. Of course, there is no guarantee that  
the investment objective of that or any other fund will be met.                 

Before investing, you should consider whether your pension plan and social      
security payments will meet your retirement needs. You should look at your      
assets and liabilities to help determine whether you need to invest more money  
to help provide retirement income. You should consider how much time you have   
until retirement and the effect of inflation and taxes on your savings and      
investments. You should also keep in mind that experts say that people need 70% 
to 80% of their pre-retirement income to maintain the same standard of living   
after retirement. Before contributing to a contract, you should consider        
whether you have already reached your contribution limit on your 401(k) or      
403(b) savings plans. Consult your tax advisor to learn more about these        
limits.                                                                         

You should also consider what types of investments are best suited for you and  
your current needs. In particular, you should consider the tax treatment of a   
variable annuity as compared with a standard mutual fund product. With          
annuities, earnings generally grow tax-deferred and investors are provided the  
option of lifetime income upon retirement. However, annuities may have          
restrictions on withdrawals before age 59 1/2, and thus may not be suitable for 
goals other than retirement. We may compare annuities to mutual funds in sales  
literature and advertisements.                                                  

You should also consider the risks of any investment relative to its potential  
rewards. In particular, you should be aware of the risk that arises from market 
timing. Market timing is an investment technique whereby amounts are            
transferred from one category of investment to another (for example, from       
stocks to bonds) based upon a perception of how each of those categories of     
investments will perform relative to the others at a particular time. Investors 
who engage in market timing run the risk that they may transfer out of a type   
of investment with a rising market value or transfer into a type of investment  
with a falling market value. We do not endorse the practice of market timing.   

The variety of issues to consider highlights the importance of the support and  
services that we provide. These services include: (1) retirement and life       
insurance planning expertise from professional counselors rather than           
commissioned salespeople; (2) detailed information through quarterly            
transaction reports, newsletters and other publications about retirement        
planning; and (3) seminars, individual counseling, an Information Center, and   
24-hour automated toll-free numbers for transactions and inquiries. If you      
request it, we will send you periodic reminders to remit premiums to the        
contract.                                                                       

Additional Information                                                          

A registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange        
Commission ("SEC"), under the 1933 Act, with respect to the contracts discussed 
in the Prospectus and in this Statement of Additional Information. Not all of   
the information set forth in the registration statement, and its amendments and 
exhibits has been included in the Prospectus or this Statement of Additional    
Informa-tion. Statements contained in this registration statement concerning    
the contents of the contracts and other legal instruments are intended to be    
summaries. For a complete statement of the terms of these documents, you should 
refer to the instruments filed with the SEC.

should not be considered as bearing on the investment performance of the assets 
held in the separate account.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Contractowner of                                                         
TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1:                                         

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of         
TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 (the "Account") as of December 31, 1998,   
and the related statements of operations and changes in net assets for the      
period December 1, 1998 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 1998.      
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Account's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audit.                                                                   

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing           
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of         
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence   
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of the TIAA-CREF Life Separate    
Account VA-1 at December 31, 1998, and the results of its operations and the    
changes in its net assets for the period December 1, 1998 (commencement of      
operations) to December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted         
accounting principles.

TIAA-CREF LIFE SEPARATE ACCOUNT VA-1
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION                                                            

TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 (the "Account") was established by         
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company ("TIAA-CREF Life") as a separate investment    
account under New York law on July 27, 1998. TIAA-CREF Life, which commenced    
operations as a legal reserve life insurance company under the insurance laws of
the State of New York on December 18, 1996, is a wholly-owned indirect          
subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America ("TIAA"),   
also a legal reserve life insurance company which was established under the     
insurance laws of the State of New York in 1918.                                

The Account is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission           
("Commission") as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of   
1940. The Account invests in shares of the Stock Index Fund of TIAA-CREF Life   
Funds (the "Fund"), an open-end management investment company that was organized
as a business trust under Delaware law on August 13, 1998. The investment       
objective of the Fund is favorable long-term return from a diversified portfolio
selected to track the overall market for common stocks publicly traded in the   
United States, as represented by a broad stock market index.                    

The Account commenced operations on December 1, 1998 when TIAA-CREF Life        
purchased 4,000 Accumulation Units of the Account at $25 per Unit, for a total  
of $100,000. The Account then purchased 4,000 shares of the Fund. At December
31, 1998, the Account owned 4,008 shares in the Fund, with a total value of     
$104,412. The Account began offering Accumulation Units to contractowners other 
than TIAA-CREF Life on January 4, 1999.                                         

TIAA-CREF Life provides all administrative services for the Account. Teachers   
Personal Investors Services, Inc. ("TPIS"), an indirect subsidiary of TIAA,     
which is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and is a member of   
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., performs distribution     
functions for contracts pursuant to a Principal Underwriting and Administrative 
Services Agreement.                                                             

NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                         

The preparation of financial statements may require management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income,
expenses and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from those          
estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies    
consistently followed by the Account, which are in conformity with generally    
accepted accounting principles.                                                 

Valuation of Investment: The market value of the investment in the Fund is based
on the net asset value of the Fund as of the close of business on the valuation 
date.                                                                           

Accounting for Investment: Securities transactions are accounted for as of the  
date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date). Dividend income is      
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses on security         
transactions are based on the specific identification method.                   

Federal Income Taxes: Based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, no      
federal income taxes are attributable to the net investment experience of the   
Account.                                                                        

NOTE 3--EXPENSE CHARGES                                                         

Daily charges are deducted from the net assets of the Account for services      
required to administer the Account and the contracts, and to cover certain      
insurance risks borne by TIAA-CREF Life. The administrative expense charge is   
currently set at an annual rate of 0.20% of the net assets of the Account.      
TIAA-CREF Life also imposes a daily charge for bearing certain mortality and    
expense risks in connection with the contracts equivalent to an annual rate of  
0.10% of the net assets of the Account.                                         

NOTE 4--INVESTMENTS                                                             

Purchases of Fund shares for the period December 1, 1998 (commencement of       
operations) to December 31, 1998, were $100,211. There were no sales of Fund    
shares during the period.

 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company:                                             

The accompanying statutory-basis financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life         
Insurance Company ("TIAA-CREF Life") are the responsibility of management. They 
have been prepared on the basis of statutory accounting practices, a            
comprehensive basis of accounting comprised of accounting practices prescribed  
or permitted by the New York State Insurance Department. The financial          
statements of TIAA-CREF Life have been presented fairly and objectively in      
accordance with such statutory accounting practices.                            

TIAA-CREF Life has established and maintains a strong system of internal        
control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are properly       
safeguarded and transactions are properly executed in accordance with           
management's authorization, and to carry out the ongoing responsibilities of    
management for reliable financial statements.                                   

The accompanying statutory-basis financial statements of TIAA-CREF Life have    
been audited by the independent auditing firm of Ernst & Young LLP. The         
independent auditors' report, which appears on the following page, expresses an 
independent opinion on the fairness of presentation of these statutory          
financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company:                                           

We have audited the accompanying statutory-basis balance sheets of TIAA-CREF    
Life Insurance Company ("TIAA-CREF Life") as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and 
the related statutory-basis statements of operations, changes in capital and    
surplus, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements    
are the responsibility of TIAA-CREF Life's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. TIAA-CREF 
Life's financial statements for the period December 18, 1996 (commencement of   
operations) through December 31, 1996, were audited by other auditors whose     
report, dated March 11, 1997, expressed an adverse opinion as to their          
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, because the financial 
statements were presented in accordance with statutory accounting practices     
prescribed or permitted by the New York State Insurance Department, and an      
unqualified opinion as to their conformity with such statutory accounting       
practices.                                                                      

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of         
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence   
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, TIAA-CREF Life presents its 
financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices, which   
practices differ from generally accepted accounting principles. The differences 
between such statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting   
principles and the effect on the accompanying financial statements are          
described in Note 2.                                                            

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding 
paragraph, the 1998 and 1997 statutory-basis financial statements referred to   
above do not present fairly, in conformity with generally accepted accounting   
principles, the financial position of TIAA-CREF Life at December 31, 1998 or    
1997 or the results of its operations or its cash flows for the years then      
ended.                                                                          

However, in our opinion, the 1998 and 1997 statutory-basis financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial       
position of TIAA-CREF Life at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of    
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with   
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York State    
Insurance Department.

TIAA-CREF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
 NOTES TO STATUTORY-BASIS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1998
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS                                             

TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company commenced operations as a legal reserve life   
insurance company under the insurance laws of the State of New York on December
18, 1996, under its former name, TIAA Life Insurance Company ("TIAA Life"). TIAA
Life changed its name to TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company ("TIAA-CREF Life") on 
May 1, 1998. TIAA-CREF Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIAA-CREF           
Enterprises, Inc. ("Enterprises"), formerly TIAA Holdings, Inc., which is a     
wholly-owned subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America
("TIAA"), a legal reserve life insurance company established under the insurance
laws of the State of New York in 1918.                                          

Effective December 18, 1996, TIAA-CREF Life entered into an indemnity           
reinsurance agreement with TIAA to reinsure a limited number of individual life 
insurance policies on a 50% coinsurance basis. As of December 31, 1998, all of  
TIAA-CREF Life's policy reserves are associated with these reinsured policies.  
Beginning in January 1999, TIAA-CREF Life began issuing personal annuity        
contracts with fixed and variable components.                                   

NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                         

TIAA-CREF Life's statutory-basis financial statements have been prepared on the 
basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed by the New York State        
Insurance Department ("Department"), a comprehensive basis of accounting that   
differs from generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation 
of TIAA-CREF Life's financial statements requires management to make estimates  
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently followed by       
TIAA-CREF Life.                                                                 

Valuation of Investments: Bonds, mortgage loans and short-term investments (debt
securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of acquisition) are  
generally stated at amortized cost. For loan-backed bonds and structured        
securities, amortized cost is determined using actual and anticipated cash flows
under the retrospective method. Anticipated prepayments are based on            
life-to-date payment speeds, using historical cash flows and internal estimates.
Separate account assets are stated at market value.                             

Accounting for Investments: Investment transactions are accounted for as of the 
date the investments are settled (settlement date). Realized capital gains and  
losses on investment transactions are accounted for under the specific          
identification method.                                                          

Policy Reserves: Policy reserves are determined in accordance with standard     
valuation methods approved by the Department and are computed in accordance with
standard actuarial formulas. The reserves established utilize assumptions for   
interest (at an average rate of approximately 3%), mortality and other risks    
insured. Such reserves establish a sufficient provision for all contractual     
benefits guaranteed under policy provisions.                                    

Asset Valuation Reserve: The Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR"), which covers all  
invested asset classes, is an explicit liability reserve required by the        
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and is intended to     
provide for potential future credit and equity losses. Formula calculations     
determine the required contribution amounts, and contributions to the AVR are   
reported as transfers from surplus.                                             

Interest Maintenance Reserve: The Interest Maintenance Reserve ("IMR") is a     
liability reserve required by the NAIC which accumulates realized capital gains 
and losses resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Such capital gains and    
losses are amortized out of the IMR, under the grouped method of amortization,  
as an adjustment to net investment income over the remaining lives of the assets
sold. All net capital gains on short-term investments were fully amortized out  
of the IMR by the end of each period presented.                                 

Income and Expenses: Premiums, investment income and expenses are reported as   
earned/incurred.                                                                

Federal Income Taxes: Effective for 1998 TIAA-CREF Life will file a consolidated
federal income tax return with its qualifying affiliates. The tax sharing       
agreement will follow the current reimbursement method, whereby members of the  
consolidated group will generally be reimbursed for their losses on a pro-rata  
basis by other members of the group to the extent that they have taxable income,
subject to limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. The federal     
income tax pro-                                                                 

B-20

visions in the accompanying statements of operations are based on taxes actually
paid or anticipated to be paid under the tax sharing agreement.                 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: GAAP is a comprehensive basis of      
accounting that is comprised of the authoritative accounting pronouncements     
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of   
Certified Public Accountants and other standard setting bodies. The differences 
between GAAP and statutory accounting practices could have a material effect on 
TIAA-CREF Life's financial statements, and the primary differences can be       
summarized as follows. Under GAAP:                                              

o The AVR is eliminated and, if necessary, valuation allowances are established 
as contra assets based on asset-specific analyses rather than the           
formula-based AVR being reflected as a liability reserve;                   

o The IMR is eliminated and realized gains and losses resulting from interest   
rate fluctuations are reported as a component of net income rather than     
being accumulated in and subsequently amortized out of the IMR;             

o Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the     
policies issued rather than being charged to operations as incurred;        

o Policy reserves are based on estimates of expected mortality and interest     
rather than being based on statutory mortality and interest requirements;   

o Long-term bond investments considered to be "available for sale" are carried  
at fair value rather than at amortized cost;                                

o Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences   
between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and     
liabilities rather than not being recognized.                               

Management believes that the effects of these differences would increase        
TIAA-CREF Life's total capital if GAAP were implemented.                        

Reclassification: Certain amounts in the 1997 financial statements have been    
reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation.

Mortgage Loan Investments: TIAA-CREF Life makes mortgage loans, principally     
collateralized by commercial real estate. TIAA-CREF Life's mortgage underwriting
standards generally result in first mortgage liens on completed income-producing
properties for which the loan-to-value ratio at the time of closing generally   
ranges between 65% and 75%.

NOTE 3--INVESTMENTS (Concluded)                                                 

TIAA-CREF Life employs a system to monitor the effects of current and expected  
market conditions and other factors on the collectability of mortgage loans and 
the realizability of real estate investments. This system is utilized to        
identify and quantify any permanent impairments in value (none identified at    
December 31, 1998 and 1997). The range of coupon rates for mortgage loans issued
during 1998 was from 6.83% to 6.95%.                                            

The mortgage loan investments outstanding at December 31, 1998 are              
collateralized by shopping centers 65.8%, and apartments 34.2% located in the   
South Atlantic 65.8% and East North Central 34.2% regions.                      

At December 31, 1998, the contractual maturity schedule of mortgage loans is    
shown below:

NOTE 5--DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                   

The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments presented in the      
following tables have been determined by TIAA-CREF Life using market information
available as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 and appropriate valuation            
methodologies. However, considerable judgement is necessarily required to       
interpret market data in developing the estimates of fair value for financial   
instruments for which there are no available market value quotations. The       
estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts TIAA-CREF Life
could have realized in a market exchange. The use of different market           
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the   
estimated fair value amounts.

Cash and short-term investments ................     7,544,346        7,544,346  

Bonds: The fair values for publicly traded long-term bond investments are       
determined using quoted market prices. For privately placed long-term bond      
investments without a readily ascertainable market value, such values are       
determined with the assistance of an independent pricing service utilizing a    
discounted cash flow methodology based on coupon rates, maturity provisions and 
assigned credit ratings.                                                        

Mortgages: The fair value of mortgages are determined with the assistance of an 
independent pricing service utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology based  
on coupon rates, maturity provisions and assigned credit ratings.               

Cash and short-term investments: The carrying values are reasonable estimates of
their fair values.                                                              

Separate account seed money investment: The carrying value is a reasonable      
estimate of its fair value.                                                     

Insurance contracts: TIAA-CREF Life's reinsurance agreement entails mortality   
risks and is, therefore, exempt from the fair value disclosure requirements     
related to financial instruments.                                               

NOTE 6--MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS                                                   

The majority of services for the operation of TIAA-CREF Life are provided, at   
cost, by TIAA pursuant to a Service Agreement. Expense reimbursement payments   
under the Service Agreement are made quarterly by TIAA-CREF Life to TIAA based  
on estimated expenses. Payments are adjusted quarterly to reflect the actual    
expenses incurred.

TIAA-CREF Life Separate Account VA-1 ("VA-1") is a unit investment trust with   
all of its assets invested in an underlying portfolio of mutual funds, TIAA-CREF
Life Funds. Currently, TIAA-CREF Life Funds has one investment portfolio, the   
Stock Index Fund, which invests in a diversified portfolio of equity securities 
selected to track the overall United States stock market. VA-1 was established  
on July 22, 1998 and received a $100,000 seed money investment from TIAA-CREF   
Life on December 1, 1998.

It is the opinion of management that any liabilities which might arise, over and
above amounts already provided for in the financial statements, are not         
considered material in relation to TIAA-CREF Life's financial position or the   
results of its operations.

NOTE 9--YEAR 2000 (Unaudited)                                                   

Because TIAA provides all administrative support for TIAA-CREF Life, TIAA is the
owner and operator of all computer systems and software used by TIAA-CREF Life. 
Like all other financial service organizations, TIAA could be adversely affected
if the computer systems that it uses and those used by its major service        
providers do not properly process and calculate date-related information on or  
after January 1, 2000. TIAA has taken steps that management believes are prudent
and reasonably designed to address the Year 2000 issue. TIAA has developed, and 
is executing, an extensive Year 2000 remediation and certification plan that    
addresses its critical computer systems, as well as the interfaces with its     
important external vendors and service providers. TIAA has also developed       
contingency plans intended to minimize the impact that unexpected systems       
failures (internal and external) may have on its operations. Management has     
periodically apprised the TIAA Board of Trustees regarding these plans and the  
progress of efforts to deal with the Year 2000 issue. Although there can be no  
absolute assurance that these steps will be sufficient to address all aspects of
the Year 2000 issue, management does not anticipate that the Year 2000 issue    
will have a significant adverse impact on TIAA's business operations.           

B-25
