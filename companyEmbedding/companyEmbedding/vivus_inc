P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.91      Net Money Flow ($)  -15,909    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

VIVUS (VVUS): Will Qsymia & Stendra Sales Improve in 2017?


January 03, 2017, 04:20:00 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com









































Shutterstock photo


 On Jan 3, we issued an updated report on VIVUS, Inc. VVUS  . VIVUS' three-month share price movement shows that the stock has significantly outperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomed/Genetics  industry. Specifically, the company gained 3.6% during this period, while the industry lost 8.2%.       The company's portfolio comprises two drugs - Qsymia for chronic weight management and Stendra (EU trade name: Spedra) for erectile dysfunction (ED).    Qsymia, VIVUS' key drug, is the first weight loss product to be approved by the FDA in 13 years. However, sales of the drug have been lackluster so far. Its uptake has been slow due to high out-of-pocket costs for patients owing to the lack of reimbursement for the product. Healthcare providers are often hesitant to treat obesity proactively despite the presence of evidence related to cardiometabolic benefits of weight loss among overweight and obese individuals.    Qsymia faces intense competition too. The branded obesity market has quite a few established players including Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s ARNA  Belviq, Novo Nordisk's Saxenda and Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc.'s OREX  Contrave.    VIVUS is working on ramping up Qsymia sales through the expansion of reimbursement payments and promotional initiatives. The company is also striving to improve patient access while reducing out-of-pocket costs for Qsymia. Moreover, the company is pursuing several programs to increase the utilization of the drug for the eligible patient population. In Jun 2016, the company upgraded a Qsymia Patient Savings Offer in order to attract new patients and offer long-term support related to weight management.    Another marketed product in the company's portfolio is Stendra, approved for the treatment of ED. VIVUS has collaborations with several companies for the commercialization of Stendra. It has inked a licensing and commercialization deal with Sanofi SNY  for the approval and commercialization of the drug in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia. Moreover, it has a deal with Italy-based privately held pharmaceutical company Menarini in over 40 European countries, Australia and New Zealand.

FDA Advisory Committee Recommends Approval of Qnexa®


MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb. 22, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- VIVUS, Inc. (NASDAQ: VVUS) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended Qnexa be granted marketing approval by the FDA for the treatment of obesity in adults. The Committee voted 20 to 2, on the recommendation for an approval based on a favorable benefit-risk profile.
"We are pleased with the panel's approval recommendation in support of the safety and efficacy of Qnexa," said Peter Tam, President of VIVUS. "We look forward to working with the FDA as they complete their evaluation. Obesity is a serious medical condition, and we are committed to making Qnexa available and providing physicians with a new medical treatment option in their battle with this public health epidemic." 
The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of its advisory committees, but will consider the guidance during the review of the New Drug Application (NDA) that was submitted for Qnexa in October 2011. The scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for Qnexa is April 17, 2012. 
Note to Investors
VIVUS will hold a conference call to discuss this update today, February 22, 2012, beginning at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time. You can listen to this call by dialing toll free 877-359-2916 or 224-357-2386. A 30-day archive of the call can be accessed at http://ir.vivus.com/.
About Qnexa Controlled Release Capsules
Qnexa [kyoo-nek-suh] is an investigational drug candidate being developed to address weight loss, type 2 Diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. Qnexa is a once-a-day, proprietary, oral, controlled-release formulation of low-dose phentermine and topiramate, which is designed to decrease appetite and increase satiety (the sense of feeling full), the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior. In phase 2 and 3 clinical data to date, patients taking Qnexa have demonstrated statistically significant weight loss, glycemic control, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, when used in combination with a diet and lifestyle modification program. 
About VIVUS
VIVUS is a biopharmaceutical company developing therapies to address obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes and male sexual health.  The company's lead investigational product in clinical development, Qnexa, has completed phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of obesity and is currently being considered for approval by US and EU regulators.  VIVUS received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to the initial Qnexa NDA on October 28, 2010.  We resubmitted the Qnexa NDA in October 2011, with an FDA action date of April 17, 2012.  Qnexa is also in phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  In 
the area of sexual health, VIVUS has submitted an NDA for avanafil, a PDE5 inhibitor being studied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, with an FDA action date of April 29, 2012.  For more information about the company, please visit www.vivus.com. 
Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "likely," "may," "plan," "potential," predict," "opportunity" and "should," among others.  There are a number of factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the response from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to our resubmission of the New Drug Application, or NDA, for Qnexa for the treatment of obesity, including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss, recommended for obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or overweight patients (BMI 
≥27 kg/m2) with weight-related co-morbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or central adiposity (abdominal obesity), with a contraindication that excludes the use of Qnexa by women who are pregnant; the timing and results of the retrospective observational study of fetal outcomes in infants born to mothers exposed to topiramate during pregnancy, or the FORTRESS study; the reliability of the electronic medical claims healthcare databases used in the FORTRESS study; the FDA's interpretation of and agreement with the information VIVUS submitted relating to teratogenicity and cardiovascular safety; the FDA's interpretation of the data from our SEQUEL study (OB-305) and Sleep Apnea study (OB-204); that we may be required to provide further analysis of clinical trial data; our response to 
questions and requests for additional information including additional pre-clinical or clinical studies from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for Qnexa; the results of external studies to assess the teratogenic risk of topiramate; results of the REMS or cardiovascular outcomes for obesity advisory meetings; the voting results of the second advisory committee meeting for Qnexa; the impact, if any, of the agreement by one of our competitors with an obesity compound to conduct or complete a cardiovascular outcomes study pre-approval; impact on future sales based on specific indication and contraindications contained in the label and extent of the REMS, distribution and patient access program; the FDA's response to the NDA filed for 
avanafil; our ability to successfully commercialize or establish a marketing partnership for avanafil or our partner's ability to obtain regulatory approval to manufacture and adequately supply avanafil for commercial use; our history of losses and variable quarterly results; substantial competition; risks related to the failure to protect our intellectual property and litigation in which we may become involved; uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement; our reliance on sole source suppliers; our limited sales and marketing efforts and our reliance on third parties; failure to continue to develop innovative investigational drug candidates and drugs; risks related to the failure to obtain FDA or foreign authority clearances or approvals and noncompliance with applicable regulations; our ability to demonstrate through clinical testing the safety and 
effectiveness of our investigational drug candidates; our dependence on the performance of our collaborative partners; the timing of initiation and completion of clinical trials and submissions to the FDA or foreign authorities; the volatility and liquidity of the financial markets; our liquidity and capital resources; and our expected future revenues, operations and expenditures.  As with any pharmaceutical in development, there are significant risks in the development, the regulatory approval, and commercialization of new products. There are no guarantees that our response to the FDA's CRL or CHMP's 180-day list of outstanding issues, the FDA's requests stemming from the end-of-review meeting or the results of the FORTRESS study and subsequent meetings and communications will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA or CHMP's safety concerns, that 
the FDA or foreign authorities will not require us to conduct any additional prospective studies or retrospective observational studies, or that any product will receive regulatory approval for any indication or prove to be commercially successful.  VIVUS does not undertake an obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Investors should read the risk factors set forth in VIVUS' Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2010, and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
