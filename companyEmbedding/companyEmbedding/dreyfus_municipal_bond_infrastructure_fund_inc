Dreyfus Municipal Bond Infrastructure Fund, Inc.


NYSE Symbol: DMB

Seeks to provide as high a level of current income exempt from regular federal income tax as is consistent with the preservation of capital
Portfolio comprised principally of investments that finance the development, support or improvement of America’s infrastructure
Sub-advised by Standish, a recognized leader in municipal bond investing with a focus on credit research and timely trade execution

Investment StrategyThe Fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds issued to finance infrastructure sectors and projects in the United States, under normal circumstances.
Infrastructure sectors and projects in which the Fund may invest include (but are not limited to):






Fund Facts:Investment Manager: The Dreyfus CorporationSub-adviser: Standish Mellon Asset Management Company LLCCUSIP: 26203D 101Portfolio Managers: Christine Todd, CFA, Jeffrey Burger, CFA, Daniel Rabasco, CFA, and Thomas CaseyInitial Public Offering (IPO) Effective Date: April 25, 2013IPO Price: $15.00; 16,950,000 shares issuedDividend Policy: Monthly (Expected to be declared approximately 45 after IPO date; distributed approximately 60-90 days after IPO date)
About Standish:

Standish was founded in 1933, and is based in Boston
Dedicated exclusively to fixed income and credit solutions
U.S. $167 billion in assets under management, with $28 billion in total municipal bond assets under management.
U.S., regional, and global mandates in 38 countries


Shares of closed-end investment companies, such as the Fund, typically trade on a national stock exchange, and these shares frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors’ risk of loss.The material on this page is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy or sell these securities, in any jurisdiction, by Dreyfus or its divisions, including MBSC Securities Corporation (“MBSC”).
The Fund’s common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “DMB.”
Certain Investment Risks:Bond funds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call, and market risks, to varying degrees. High yield bonds involve increased credit and liquidity risk compared with investment grade bonds and are considered speculative in terms of the issuer’s ability to pay interest and repay principal on a timely basis. Municipal infrastructure bond funds also are subject to the special risks related to infrastructure investments, such as capital requirements and the regulatory environment related to infrastructure projects.  The Fund also may employ leverage to enhance its potential to achieve its objective, through the issuance of preferred shares or participation in tender option bond programs, or may engage in derivative transactions that have the effect of leveraging the portfolio.  Leverage can magnify the potential for gains and losses. 
It is expected that the Fund’s distributions will generally be treated as tax-exempt income for purposes of regular U.S. Federal income tax. A portion of the Fund’s distributions may be (i) subject to U.S. Federal income tax and such distributions will generally be subject to state and local taxes, and (ii) includable in taxable income for purposes of the Federal alternative minimum tax.
Dreyfus and Standish each are wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.

Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.

         Ratings are opinions and not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. Ratings should not be relied on as investment advice. Please read important disclaimer information.
	
      



         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
      



Before investing, consider the funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

         A CD ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within it, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, a lack of diversification may result in heightened volatility of your portfolio value. You must perform your own evaluation as to whether a CD ladder and the securities held within it are consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. To learn more about diversification and its effects on your portfolio, contact a representative.
	
      



         The CD ladder strategies displayed are provided for educational purposes and are not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment, financial or tax planning decisions.
	
      



         Displayed rates of return, including Annual Percentage Yield (APY), represent stated APY for either individual Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or multiple CDs within model CD ladders, were identified from Fidelity inventory as of the time stated. For current inventory, including available CDs, please view the CDs & Ladders tab.
	
      



         The CDs in the CD Search Results screen are displayed on the basis of them offering the highest yields available given certain selected criteria. The criteria entered are at the sole discretion of the user, including the maturities of the strategy selected and yield-based inventory filtering, and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities.
	
      



         You acknowledge that your requests for information are unsolicited and shall neither constitute, nor be considered as investment advice by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, Fidelity Distributors Corporation, or their affiliates (collectively, "Fidelity").
	
      



         Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are debt instruments offered by commercial banks, thrifts and brokerages to raise funds for their business activities. Minimum investment amount is typically one CD or multiple CDs for a ladder strategy. All brokered CDs displayed are FDIC-insured as indicated by the Attribute: FDIC. The FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per institution per category of account, or up to $250,000 in qualifying retirement accounts. Note that FDIC insurance only covers the principal amount of the CD and any accrued interest. In some instances, CD's may be purchased on the secondary market at a price which reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance.

         1. The secondary market may be limited. The pre-maturity sale price of CDs may be less than its original purchase price, particularly if interest rates are higher at the time of sale. There may be certain features or provisions of the CD that may also influence its market price. If you want to buy or sell a CD, Fidelity Brokered Services LLC ("FBS") may charge you a fee. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the BondDesk platform, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         2. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate of your CD may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step rate CDs do, please be aware the decision to call the CD is at the issuer’s sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may be confronted with a less favorable interest rate at which to reinvest your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution.
	
      



         3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
      



         4. Fidelity makes new issue CDs available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC receive compensation for participating in the offering as a selling group member or underwriter.
	
      



         5. Other concessions apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

         The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
	
      



         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
      



Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.




Minimum concessions of $19.95 apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S. Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades, reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. dollar–denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply; see Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may affect the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.




         If you want to buy or sell a CD on the secondary market, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS") will charge you a concession. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the Tradeweb Markets, TMC Bonds, and Knight Capital Group platforms, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.

         For purposes of determining a municipal bond’s rating, the yield table uses the greater of the third party guarantor's or insurer's financial strength rating and underlying rating, where applicable. Consider the financial strength ratings of the third party guarantor or insurer as well as any published underlying rating of the issuer for a more complete assessment of the bond's credit risk profile.

PLEASE NOTE: Holdings data is unaudited and provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Portfolio composition is subject to change at any time. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security.
Large concentrations can increase share price volatility. Portfolio holdings include those assets purchased through the use of leverage by Dreyfus High Yield Strategies Fund (DHF). Subject to market conditions, DHF utilizes leverage through borrowings or other transactions, which creates risks for shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of DHF shares. There is no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any period in which it is employed.

VanEck's suite of municipal income ETFs offers investors the ability to exercise control over their portfolio yield, duration, and credit exposure at different points in the interest rate cycle. The indices underlying each ETF target specific maturity ranges or credit exposures, resulting in distinct performance, yield, and duration characteristics.

Source: VanEck Research. As of 06/30/17. The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. Effective Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield. This duration measure is appropriate for bonds with embedded options. Yield to Worst measures the lowest of either yield-to-maturity or yield-to-call date on every possible call date.

Yield Curve-Focused ETFs
 Our investment grade municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that reflect a unique segmentation of the investment grade municipal yield curve: short (years 1-6: SMB), intermediate (years 6-8: ITMS) (years 6-17: ITM) (years 12-17: ITML), and long (years 17-30+: MLN). 

 
Credit-Focused ETFs
Our credit-focused municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that include both the highest credit quality available in the municipal asset class (pre-refunded: PRB) and municipal high yield: short (years 1-12: SHYD) and all maturity (years 1-30+: HYD). The high yield indices include an investment grade component to help enhance liquidity.  


 
Smart Beta ETF
Our smart beta municipal ETF (XMPT) seeks to track an index that includes municipal closed-end funds (CEFs). Because CEFs have a fixed number of shares, discrepancies between NAVs and share prices can be common and generally result from changing investor sentiment. When such a fund's share price is lower than its net asset value (NAV) it's called "being at a discount." When its share price is higher than its NAV it's called "being at a premium."
This index has intelligently designed weighting rules that underweight CEFs trading at higher premiums and overweight CEFs trading at wider discounts. This built-in "buy low, sell high" mechanism is one way investors can potentially benefit from investing in the municipal CEF market.  


 
ETFs Provide Low Cost Access to Munis
The fees of an investment vehicle are important; they affect an investor's ultimate return. The average net expense ratio of municipal bond ETFs was 63 bps lower as compared to municipal bond mutual funds and 77 bps lower as compared to municipal bond closed-end funds. Many investors may prefer municipal bond ETFs for this reason.

 

Source: Morningstar. As of 06/30/17. Fees for municipal bond ETFs compared against the average net expense ratio of mutual funds and closed-end funds in the Morningstar Municipal Bond U.S. Category Group. There were 37 funds in the Muni ETF Category, 1,879 funds in the Muni Mutual Fund Category, 167 funds in the Muni Closed-End Fund Category.

Important Disclosure
Municipal bonds are subject to risks including those related to litigation, legislation, political changes, local business or economic conditions, conditions in underlying sectors, bankruptcy or other changes in the financial condition of the issuer, and/or the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets, or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. Additional risks include: credit risk, interest rate risk, and call risk. High yield bonds may be subject to a greater risk of loss of income and principal, and are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher rated securities. Some portion of Fund distributions may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
Taxable equivalent yields are used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for federal income taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond investment would have to earn in order to match, after deducting federal income taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond investment. TEY = Tax-Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 -Tax Rate).
The investment management agreement between VanEck Vectors ETF Trust (the "Trust") and Van Eck Associates Corporation (the "Adviser") provides that the Adviser will pay all expenses of the Fund, except for the fee payment under the investment management agreement, interest expense, offering costs, trading expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses. TER, or Total Expense Ratio, is also referred to as "Net Expense Ratio. Expenses for XMPT are capped contractually at 0.40% until 09/01/17. Cap excludes certain expenses, such as interest.
The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Income from corporate bonds is subject to state and Federal tax. There is no guarantee that a Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state income taxes. Federal or state changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make them less attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. Capital gains, if any, are subject to capital gains tax. Please refer to the Funds' 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            prospectus for complete risk information.
The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors exchange-traded fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called "creation units" and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
Investing involves substantial risk, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. Consider a Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus, call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com. Read carefully before investing.

Vanguard bond funds


94% of our low-cost bond funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Find income and stability with bond funds
Get higher potential for income



Bond mutual funds give your portfolio the opportunity to earn income, unlike money market funds (which focus on protecting your cash) and stock funds (which aim for long-term growth).

Add stability to your portfolio



When included in a well-balanced portfolio, bond funds can help balance the risks associated with stock funds.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds in a single fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds.

Get broad exposure to the bond markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the bond portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of bonds in a single, diversified fund.






Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund holds more than 5,000 domestic investment-grade bonds.

Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund holds about 3,000 non-U.S. bonds.

How to choose a bond fund



There are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right bond fund for your portfolio:

Am I investing outside of an IRA or other retirement account?



If you're in one of the highest tax brackets and investing outside of your retirement account, you may be able to reduce your tax exposure with a tax-exempt bond fund.
Find out if tax-exempt mutual funds are right for you
Cut your federal tax bill with a national tax-exempt fund. Get added state-tax savings if you live in:

				California

				Massachusetts

				New Jersey

				New York

				Ohio

				Pennsylvania


See a list of Vanguard tax-exempt bond funds


Do I want domestic or international bonds?



Investing in both U.S. and international bond funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

How much risk am I comfortable with?



Knowing the general traits used to identify the different bonds within a bond fund can help you determine your overall tolerance for risk.

Average maturity. Bond funds come with short-, intermediate-, or long-term maturities. The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the fund is to changes in interest rates.

Credit quality. Bonds that are backed by the government or one of its agencies have the best "creditworthiness" and a lower chance of default than most corporate bonds. Corporate bonds with high credit quality are considered investment-grade bonds, and those below investment-grade are considered high-yield ("junk") bonds.



Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While this gives you the chance to beat the benchmark, any actively managed fund could just as easily miss the mark.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Do I want to keep pace with inflation?



Inflation-protected bond funds invest in government bonds and are routinely adjusted for inflation.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates, and credit risk, which is the chance a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investments in bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.
	Vanguard average stock fund expense ratio: 0.12%; industry average stock fund expense ratio: 0.69%. Vanguard average bond fund expense ratio: 0.09%; industry average bond fund expense ratio: 0.60%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
