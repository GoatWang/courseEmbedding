Dear Dumb Airlines

 Wednesday, June 5, 2013 at 10:27PM 

Why is it that when these guys send you an e-mail telling you it is time to check in - they always include a link to check in
and that link takes you to a page where you have to log in again
or find your confirmation number and departure airport
or re enter your name
or whatever
heck: these guys send you the e-mail, they add your confirmation number, they know what time you are flying
why can't the link just take you right to your flight.
Just wondering.
Dumb.

Rethinking Mobile Business Models

 Monday, June 3, 2013 at 5:13PM 

A few years ago, you might have a real debate as to whether your consumer company should be mobile first, but the market has spoken and for many companies mobile is the way that consumers engage.
And it shows not only in the venture world, but in the public markets - where investors are keeping a keen eye on the mobile monetization strategies of companies like Zynga, Pandora and Facebook.
interestingly, at first, the goal was simply to get consumers to engage with the mobile apps - which were web apps initially, moving toward responsive design and now more commonly native apps in either iOs or Android. Now the question isn't so much engagement (which is taken as a given based on having a superior product in a category) but how you can monetize your engagement.
As you might expect the same business models as ever have emerged - being subscription (think news organizations with a pay wall), in app sales and disruption marketing - i.e. advertising.
While advertising has gotten more personalized and more advertorial (see BuzzMedia), the marketing opportunities are limited by the amount of time a consumer spends with the app. In other words, the better you deliver content and the faster you get your message across - the less time you actually have to monetize - unless of course, you are Google, and sending people off of your app pays in terms of search monetization.
What many of these mobile companies are missing is a lesson learned by cable channels a long time ago - which is that placement matters.
there are few people who do not suffer from app overload - and increasingly, it is the aps that sit on your home screen that get used 90% of the time - with everything behind relegated to the other 10%.
So if you happen to be a Pandora or a Yelp you actually have an asset (screen placement) that has yet to be monetized - but should be.
To this end, we at Raptor Ventures have partnered with Sonic Notify, a company that distributed data signals through a hypersonic signal on any audio system, and which can be decoded by any mobile device - assuming that the SDK is attached to an app on the phone. 
Thus, Pandora, with its 200M users and 75% mobile use can actually benefit from its largely home screen presence during the 23 hours a day when the average user is not engaged with the app. Same with Yelp, same with Facebook. All they need to do is integrate a small bit of code - and they immediately can begin to serve ads (and they can decide which type of ads they wish to serve - or if they wish them to be geofenced) and reap a big chunk of the ad budget from an advertiser.
So instead of having audio ads on Pandora, perhaps users who agree to receive push notifications or offers from partners of their choosing can receive a free Pandora One subscription - or perhaps the same applies to Spotify. Who knows what the future might bring - but the system is there for the using. 
While we expect this system to take some time to develop, we truly believe that the opportunity to rethink some of the business models in mobile will yield real returns in the years to come.

Swan Farming Part II - It's Really Powerball.

 Monday, September 10, 2012 at 11:27PM 

Paul Graham had a very interesting post up today on Black Swan Farming
Go read it here.
If you didn't read it - I'll summarize:
1. Venture investing is hard because the return distribution is so skewed toward outliers that it is almost impossible to tell which those will be.
2. Great ideas often lok like idiocy at the beginning
3. You don't know if you've won until after they've drawn the numbers.
For those of us who have been investing for years, much of this is a rehash, but a great one written by a very thoughtful investor.
Point One:
It should come as no surprise that the return distribution in venture is far more fat tailed than one would typically expect. After all, what is seed stage investing across a ton of companies but the purchase of a lot of lottery tickets. While one can predict the outcome of a single company based on the founders, the idea, the marketplace, the opportunities for exit etc... - the ability to predict the next Google / Facebook simply does not exist - and more than the ability for me to pick the winning powerball ticket with certainty.
And yet, that Powerball distribution is what we seen in seed stage across a large portfolio. One winning ticket absolutely dwarfs all other outcomes. More people play Powerball than invest in seed - and despite the average persons desire to see Gaussian normal distributions, people participate in fat tails twice a week.
Of course, as the saying goes - You've Got To Be In It To Win It
Point Two:
It is very rare to make great returns betting with the crowd.
You need to be early, and you need to be willing to be alone and wrong.
Oh yeah, and you need to be right.
That pretty well describes point two.
Just betting against the crowd is not enough - because more often than not -the crowd has it right. It is only by looking at things in a different way than the crowd, and seeing the possibilities that you can get those big outcomes.
Point Three:
Graham goes into great detail about funding as a measure of success and how he doesn't do this with the YC classes.
Methinks he doth protest too much.
I don't know Paul, and by all rights he is doing a great job and is incredibly well respected - but as a complete outside to his world, and from the press coverage we are already seeing, it seems as if the purpose of YC (or any other incubator these days) is to be able to jack up the proce of your next round. Lots of posts on this - but the main point is this: you really don't know if you are winning until you have won - and winning is a long term game.
VC is a long tailed asset class with an enormous amount of volatility in it.
Go back and read the Black Swan and Taleb will suggest these sorts of investments paired with super safe bond portfolios.
Not a bad suggestion

Michael Moritz

 Monday, May 21, 2012 at 9:37PM 

I've never met Michale Moritz and I don't know Michael Moritz - except through the reputation he has earned through years of exceptional returns at Sequoia.
Reading that he was stepping back due to an incurable disease reminds me not so much of Steve Jobs (I'm sure we will see quite a few comparisons there) but of Lou Gehrig stepping back from one of the great teams of all times.
And like Lou Gehrig, Moritz is already in the investing Hall of Fame.
While the absolute numbers at Sequoia have kept it at or near the top for long term returns, it is how they have generated these returns that is most impressive to me.
For years, Sequoia, under Moritz, has been a proponent of long ball investing - knowing that they would strike out a lot - but understanding that when they hit the ball out of the park, they would score a ton of runs (see the initial Google investment - or YouTube)
While many firms preach this sort of investing mantra - few have followed it with the discipline of Sequoia.
Moritz an his partners have  managed to extract the correct risk reward ratio across their portfolios - whereas others have not gotten nearly the reward on their winners (the risk is always the same in every case - a goose egg)
As an investor you simply have to understand the relationship between risk and reward and size your investments accordingly. Moritz and his partners have.
And that's the difference between the hall of fame and an under performing asset class over a career.

Who Are Your Customers?

 Monday, February 27, 2012 at 8:41AM 

At Raptor, we have the privilidge of getting to meet with a ton of great founders every day - and listening to them speak about their passions, and how they are going to turn these into great businesses.
On Friday we had a serial founder in the room and we were discussing why he had made certain decisions so far at his nascent company.
What he said was this:
"The most important decision a start up can make is to choose its customers. Once you do that, most of the questions and decisions answer themselves."

Pretty good advice that stuck with me all weekend.
when I came back around to it - I thought of all the companies that we have seen that have succeeded and those that failed - and this focus on an initial customer set seemed to be a reasonable common ground.
Simple and easy
So: who are your customers?

Tickets.com represents an organization that has about 20 major league sports teams as clients that are similar potential clients for Fan Manager (FM). Currently, FM is integrating all of Tickets.com data into the Fan Manager platforms and working with it, which is why we found it a benefit to be part of the event.

This was a great chance to build relationships with Tickets.com and MLB while learning about their roadmap, what new prospects are looking for, and who we are dealing with. We sat in a wonderful session, and it really educated us by getting us all on the same page within the industry.

Tickets.com has a huge presence within the ticketing space, as does Salesforce with sporting teams and venues. Two years ago, an opportunity presented itself to come together to join forces with Tickets.com and integrate between technology offerings and take the value proposition to another level.

Boca has worked with TDC for many years. Boca values TDC’s business and wanted to be there as a supportive sponsor and supporter. Boca wants to engage with TDC, as to what products are important for the company moving forward to help them continue to grow and evolve. The feedback of TDC is invaluable to Boca, as we continue to develop and evolve our product line.

In July of 2014 the decision was made to switch our ticketing provider to Tickets.com. As with any change, the trepidation I felt was quickly eased right out of the gate with the operational assessment that was done. It was handled with professionalism, politeness and with our best interests in mind. It was clear this was not their first rodeo. From the beginning right through to game days each and every Tickets.com staff member I’ve had the pleasure of working with has been great. The “can do” mentality is evident from the top of the organization down to the bottom. As a 28 year veteran of ticketing, working with a dozen or so different ticketing providers and several conversions, this has clearly ranked at the top. The exchange this week in Nashville was a great combination of learning and fun. Job well done TDC!

 
 Glen Davis, Director of Ticket Sales and Ticket Operations
Camelback Ranch





I always enjoy the networking opportunities that provided by the conference as well as a better understanding of the new technology that’s out on the market and it’s a chance to be among my peers. I am eager to learn more about the new technology that’s on its way through TDC and the opportunities that’s going to present.

The ProVenue Exchange has been a valuable resource for our organization. We look forward to continually enhancing our partnership with Tickets.com and all of our colleagues throughout the industry at events such as these.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the ProVenue exchange. Not only were we able to showcase our service to current and potential clients, we were also able to develop relationships with peers in the industry. And of course, we had a blast attending all the networking events and the golf tournament!

Attending the conference is always a good way to increase our intellect when it comes to all the different programs available, but it also allows us to showcase this program for other teams because we were kind of the guinea pig of it. It’s also a good place to network. You know who the people are to contact if you have any questions. You know who the subject matter experts are, not only with the vendors but with the other teams. On the baseball side, none of us are competitors off the field, only on the field, so all the other teams are a good resource for us to bring excellence to our club!

As the technology and process continue to evolve, there are always enhancements that need to occur on the access control system side, just as there are on the ticketing side. It was important for Alvarado to attend the ProVenue event in order to connect with existing and new prospective clients.

Looking to have a closer relationship as it relates with sports in general and to educate the people at the conference of the different types of technology available in regards to the ticketing industry.

Tickets.com represents an organization that has about 20 major league sports teams as clients that are similar potential clients for Fan Manager (FM). Currently, FM is integrating all of Tickets.com data into the Fan Manager platforms and working with it, which is why we found it a benefit to be part of the event.

Extensive Financial Experience Adds Strength to Board James Taylor Resigns as Board Member CINCINNATI, Sept.  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ:WKHS), a last-mile delivery technology company that is an original equipment manufacturer of medium-duty, battery-electric trucks and fully integrated unmanned aerial delivery drones, has appointed Harry DeMott to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Concurrently, James Taylor has resigned as a director of the company. The total number of Board members remains unchanged at five. Mr. DeMott, age 49, has more than 25 years experience in the investment community, having worked as an analyst and portfolio manager at leading brokerage firms and investment management firms. He has also served on the boards of several companies. He is a long-time operator and investor in the media, sports and entertainment industries. He is the co-founder of Raptor Ventures I LP, where he has been a General Partner since February 2011. In addition, Mr. DeMott is a member of the Board of Directors of Fan Manager, SecurityPoint Media, Signal360 and Ticket Evolution. He also serves as founder and managing partner for Hamerle Investments, a family investment company. Prior to co-founding Raptor Ventures, Mr. DeMott served on the Board of Directors of Pandora Media, Inc. from 2006 through 2011. Earlier, he served as senior analyst at Knighthead Capital Management, analyst at King Street Capital Management, portfolio manager at Bourgeon Capital Management and managing member and founder at Gothic Capital Management. During this 16-year period, Mr. DeMott focused on finding, fostering and investing in disruptive technology companies. He previously spent nine years at First Boston (now Credit Suisse), where he was a director in the equity research division specializing in radio, TV, outdoor advertising and cell towers. He earned a bachelor of arts in economics from Princeton University in 1988 and a MBA in finance from New York University in 1991. Mr. DeMott said, “During my career in the investment community, I have worked with emerging-growth companies and breakthrough technologies and have guided and managed their growth, helping to raise several billion dollars of public and private capital along the way. I believe Workhorse’s groundbreaking technology offers an extremely strong value proposition that deserves to be fostered. I look forward to working with my fellow Board members along with the Workhorse executive team as we seek to grow the company and shape its growth strategy in the months and years ahead.” Steve Burns, CEO of Workhorse, said, “Harry DeMott brings a tremendous amount of investment community and corporate governance experience to Workhorse and we are truly privileged to have him serve on our Board. We are confident that his keen insight and support, as well as his work with growth companies, will help smooth the road before us as we advance our hybrid electric truck and drone delivery initiatives. I would also like to offer my sincere gratitude to James Taylor for his many years of service as a Board member and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.” Forward Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements.  These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We are looking for founders who have a clear vision of their company's problems and know of solutions. We look to partner with companies that can grow in a frictionless manner, or who are growing rapidly as a result of operating within the sphere of others growing in this manner.



Harry DeMottManaging DirectorRaptor Ventures


Mr. DeMott attended Trinity School in New York City before majoring in Economics at Princeton University. He received an MBA in international finance from NYU Stern School of Business.

Harry became an equity research analyst at First Boston (now Credit Suisse) focused on media in general and broadcasting more specifically.  He was ranked by Institutional Investor as one of the top analysts in his sector, as well as being named a top stock picker in media by The Wall Street Journal.

In 2000, Harry started Gothic Capital Management, a long short equity hedge fund - focused on the media and consumer related sectors. It was here that Harry did his first two private transactions - acting as a founding investor in Titan Outdoor and dMarc Broadcasting.

In 2005, Harry moved to King Street Capital Management - a large distressed debt firm where he continued to cover media - as well as gaming, lodging, leisure and restaurants. During his 3 years at King Street he continued to invest in the VC space - putting money into Pandora (NYSE:P) , Zing (sold to Dell), Armada Media, Titan TV (sold to BIM), Kyazoonga and Whistlebox - the latter 4 as sole financial partner.

Most recently, Harry spent time at Knighthead Capital Management before joining Raptor in February of 2011. 
Representative Investments


Krush is a predictive analytics company for consumer brands and products, currently focused on the action sports and street lifestyle space. The company runs a consumer facing website that allows users to "Krush" a new product if they like it. The company has the ability to aggregate data around which new products will be popular before the products are put into production. Krush also lets brands run pre-sales of their products, giving tastemakers access to new products before they hit the mass market. Krush effectively connects brands, top consumer advocates and tastemakers, and rewards them for their loyalty.

Sonic Notify is a platform that enables media to be delivered to a smartphone or tablet based on presence. No technology to date has enabled media delivery based on a consumer standing in front of a shelf, television, or at a concert. The patent pending technology enables the communication of data in the ultra high-frequency inaudible range between any speaker and microphone. The decoding algorithm enables a common process for extracting data from audio using any microphone on any smartphone or tablet.


MediaSpike provides a native monetization platform for applications - taking the time, expense, and pain out of advertisers and developers trying to individually find and pair with each other. MediaSpike has been built from the ground-up to be a frictionless end-to-end solution for advertisers and developers alike. Imagine, with a few mouse clicks, the generic energy potion could become a real energy drink. An uninspired game coffee map could be re-branded to a major coffee chain. A generic game character could be replaced with a mascot. Imagine background music with the latest top-40 hits, in-game televisions that play the latest movie trailers - the possibilities are endless with the MediaSpike platform!

Bread is a link shortener + your personal billboard. Shorten any link with the Bread URL shortener, and we'll attach your 5-second customized billboard to it. You can use your billboard to recommend anything you want, from your favorite charity to your own website.
