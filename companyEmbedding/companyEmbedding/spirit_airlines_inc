    How to find your Confirmation Code.





        Your Confirmation Code
    

       Your Spirit Confirmation Code is a 6 character alphanumeric combination, for example ABC123. 
       Please select where you booked and then read about where your Confirmation Code can be located.
    

       If you booked with a third party not listed below, your confirmation email from them should 
       contain a 6 character code that may be referred to as a Confirmation Code or record locator.
    




 Well played, you – coming straight to spirit.com for our ultra-low fares!
 You'll find your Confirmation Code clearly highlighted near the top of your confirmation email that we sent shortly after booking,
                 or directly beneath the "Check-In Online" button on your check-in reminder email.









On Expedia's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code underneath the word "Confirmed" in the blue bar that highlights your flight itinerary.
Remember, the itinerary number listed at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On Priceline's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code in the Airline Confirmation Numbers section, directly below the Flight Numbers section.
Remember, the trip number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On CheapOair's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code further down in the Flight Summary section under "Airline Confirmation".
Remember, the booking number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On Orbitz's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code directly below the "Record Locator" heading at the top of the email.
Remember, neither the Airline Ticket Number or Orbitz Record Locator number shown later in your email can be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com

    How to find your Confirmation Code.





        Your Confirmation Code
    

       Your Spirit Confirmation Code is a 6 character alphanumeric combination, for example ABC123. 
       Please select where you booked and then read about where your Confirmation Code can be located.
    

       If you booked with a third party not listed below, your confirmation email from them should 
       contain a 6 character code that may be referred to as a Confirmation Code or record locator.
    




 Well played, you – coming straight to spirit.com for our ultra-low fares!
 You'll find your Confirmation Code clearly highlighted near the top of your confirmation email that we sent shortly after booking,
                 or directly beneath the "Check-In Online" button on your check-in reminder email.









On Expedia's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code underneath the word "Confirmed" in the blue bar that highlights your flight itinerary.
Remember, the itinerary number listed at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On Priceline's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code in the Airline Confirmation Numbers section, directly below the Flight Numbers section.
Remember, the trip number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On CheapOair's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code further down in the Flight Summary section under "Airline Confirmation".
Remember, the booking number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com









On Orbitz's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code directly below the "Record Locator" heading at the top of the email.
Remember, neither the Airline Ticket Number or Orbitz Record Locator number shown later in your email can be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

 The skinny on finding airfare deals  By  George Hobica, Special to CNN     Keep an eye on a variety of sources for unadvertised "pop-up" sales. STORY HIGHLIGHTS E-mail alerts from airlines and airfare tracking sites offer pop-up sale fares and promotions  Airline websites sometimes have the best fares to encourage direct booking  Tuesday and Wednesday are usually the cheapest travel days  Weekend fare deals frequently surface at the beginning of the week

Editor's note: George Hobica is the creator of Airfarewatchdog.com. The site is a division of Expedia.com, which also owns Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor.com.    (CNN) -- There's no doubt about it: Airfares for this summer are higher than they were a couple of years ago, especially for business trips that don't require a Saturday night stay. And even so, some airlines reported losing money last quarter, even with all those extra fees. The culprits are obvious: higher fuel prices, fewer seats, increased demand and airline mergers. But if you're flexible in where you go and when you go, there are some relative bargains out there. Most of these "sales" are completely unadvertised, and many of them last only for a few days or hours. We call them pop-up sales. At Airfarewatchdog.com, we recently sent out fare alerts for flights from several major hub airports (such as Miami, Newark, Dallas, Denver, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Washington and Salt Lake City) to Honolulu for tax-included fares as low as $400 round-trip -- even for peak summer travel.  And a ton of $200 tax-included summertime fares in many markets popped up for only a few hours not long ago. Airtran recently sold seats from Baltimore to Los Angeles on nonstop flights for peak July and August travel for $296 round-trip including tax, hundreds less than what other airlines were charging. (Fares from neighboring Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles were much higher, so here's a good example of how being flexible in your travel plans can save money). So although summer airfares are on average higher, here's how to increase your chances of snagging a deal. Before you do anything, sign up for free airfare alerts I'm a fan of this service, obviously, as founder of Airfarewatchdog, but seriously, why do all the work hunting down a low airfare yourself when you can have someone else do it for free?  Many airfare search and listing sites, such as Travelocity.com, Yapta.com,  TripAdvisor.com/Flights, Bing.com/travel (and, of course, Airfarewatchdog.com) offer e-mailed airfare alerts when prices go down. This is just a partial list; do a browser search for "airfare alerts" to see what's available. Get e-mail from your airlines Next, sign up for e-mails and frequent flier programs from as many airlines as you can tolerate. Sure, you already get enough e-mail, but you want to fly cheaply, right? Here's why: Airlines are trying to woo customers to book directly with them by offering special deals when you sign up for their newsletters and e-mail lists. One way they do this is by offering "promo code" deals that are redeemable only on their websites.  It might be 10% off, or $10 off, or even a half-price sale. JetBlue recently sent out a 20%-off systemwide promo code. They also alert you to special deals that can be booked only on their websites or that are available only to members of their loyalty programs. Once that's done, let the search begin. Ask yourself this question: Are you a flexible flier? If you answer yes, you're in luck, because you'll get the lowest airfares. Let's say you've been promising your sister you'd visit her sometime this year. But whenever you search for a good airfare, the prices are out of reach. If it doesn't really matter when you go, then you need to search on a website that caters to those with flexible travel dates.  Start by clicking over to Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com, Hotwire.com or Cheaptickets.com (all of which are online travel agencies, or OTAs in industry parlance), and check the "flexible dates" button or link.  On Travelocity, enter your origin and destination and hit search. You'll see the lowest published fares for travel dates up to 330 days into the future. You'll then need to click on the fare calendars to see when those fares are available.  Orbitz, Hotwire and Cheaptickets do a flexible date search over any 30-day period you choose. (Keep in mind that American Airlines is not currently listed on Orbitz but is back on Hotwire and Expedia.) After you find a fare, see if Southwest, which lists its fares only on its Southwest.com website, has a better deal (remember that Southwest doesn't charge for the first two checked bags, so you need to factor that in as well as the fare). Southwest, too, has an excellent flexible date tool (look for "Low Fare Calendar" on the site's homepage).  And check out AllegiantAir.com to see if Allegiant Airlines flies where you're headed, since it, too, sells tickets only on its own website. What if you're not flexible in your travel dates? The above-mentioned sites can be helpful in that case as well, but you also might want to try sites such as Kayak.com, Tripadvisor.com/Flights, and Momondo.com.  These are "meta search" fare sites, and although they don't offer quite the travel date flexibility as some others do, they often include fares that the airlines sell only on their own websites. None of them include Southwest's fares, however, or fares on the smaller but growing Allegiant Airlines. Don't overlook online travel agencies (OTAs) A lot of people swear by searching directly on airline websites rather than third-party sites such as Expedia, and I get this. But online travel agencies can sometimes do a better job. They'll let you know if the best deal is on a combination of airlines (say, going out on US Airways and coming back on United) and they also show the widest range of schedules and fares. Plus, they offer air-plus-hotel packages that can sometimes save you serious cash. Don't overlook business-class fares to Europe this summer Sounds crazy, but American Airlines last month had business-class fares to Europe for peak summer travel at prices lower than economy class for the same dates. (Oddly, Travelocity had these deals, and Kayak didn't.) Airline websites sometimes have the best fares Next stop: your airline's website. Increasingly, airlines aren't sharing their very best fares with third-party sites such as Orbitz and Kayak. Case in point: Recent fares to London from the West Coast for $420 round-trip, including tax, were available only on Spanish airline Iberia's website. (Similar fares were twice that elsewhere.) So once you've found a fare, definitely check airline sites directly rather than assuming your favorite third-party site will have all the best deals. Watch for promo codes See those little promo code boxes on your favorite airline's website? What's that all about? From time to time, you'll receive promo codes in your e-mail because you signed up for e-mail from your favorite airlines and online travel agencies. These codes can be redeemed only if you book directly on the airlines' websites, another way they try to build consumer loyalty and cut out the middleman. Getting the best last-minute airfares You'll often get the best fares if you book at least seven to 21 days ahead of departure. But what if you don't have that luxury? Other than the airlines' last-minute weekend fares, which you can find on their sites, your best bet is Priceline.com's "Name your own price" feature or Hotwire.com. Also take a look at Lastminute.com, which packages last-minute airfares with hotel and rental car deals. Amazingly, the cost of these packages is often less than what you'd pay for airfare alone. When to use a real live travel agent There is another way to find a low airfare, and it's one your mother probably used. Pick up the phone and call a local travel agent, the kind with a real storefront. As good as do-it-yourself online sources can be, your friendly neighborhood travel agent may have some tricks up her sleeve to save you money.  Let's say, for example, that you get an airfare alert that fares from Houston to Honolulu are $800 round-trip. But who knew that the same trip, same dates, from Dallas is $300? Or that you can fly from Houston to Dallas for $100 and connect onward? Travel agents also sell "consolidator" airfares, which are heavily discounted deals (mostly on international flights). These fares come with more restrictions but can save you money.  Brick-and-mortar travel agents often charge for their services, but they can also find you amazing package deals, and the savings can be tremendous. Is there a "magic" hour or day to buy? It's true that the airlines' weekend deals come out Monday to Wednesday, and some airlines announce their sales early in the week, but if you limit yourself to searching just on those days, you'll miss out.  A good fare can pop up literally any moment of the week. And if you search one minute or one day and the fare is way too high, don't despair. Come back an hour or two or a day or two later and search again. Not only do airfares change with the wind, but the number of seats offered at the lowest fares changes as well, based on supply and demand. Best days to travel Although a low airfare can pop up anytime, one thing's for certain: It's cheaper to fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Saturday is also a low-fare day. If traveling internationally, Monday to Wednesday is often the sweet spot.

History[edit]
Early years (1964-2006)[edit]
The company initially started as Clipper Trucking Company in 1964.[4] The company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc., in 1974.[5] The airline service was founded in 1980 in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One,[5] a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas. In 1990, Charter One began scheduled service from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, to Atlantic City. On May 29, 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines.[6] Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992.[6] Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.[6]
On April 2, 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida.[7] Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began on September 25, 1993.[8] Service at Philadelphia began in 1994.[9] During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.
In Summer 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers' tickets were canceled.[10] The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights.[10] In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor's airline.[10]
Spirit initially had their headquarters in Eastpointe, Michigan (formerly East Detroit) in Metro Detroit.[11] It relocated its headquarters in November 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida in the Miami Metropolitan Area.[12] Prior to the decision to move the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan.[13]
In 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed to fine Spirit Airlines $67,000 for allegedly violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards. Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit's DC9 and MD80 aircraft.
In November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan including a website and dedicated reservation line.
In the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit also began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006, and in 2007 filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela.
In 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.
Transition to ultra low cost carrier and pilot strike (2007-2010)[edit]

On March 6, 2007, Spirit began a transition to an ultra low-cost carrier. Their initial plan was to begin charging US$10 per checked bag for the first two bags, $5 if bags are reserved before 24 hours prior to the flight, in addition to charging $1 for drinks which were previously complimentary.
On June 3, 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases.[14] In September 2008, Spirit began advertising on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.[15]
In May 2009, Spirit pilots overwhelmingly voted in favor of strike action (98% of votes) due to stalled contract negotiations with management. Areas of dispute included compensation, work rules and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest paid Airbus pilots in the United States.
On June 20, 2010, Spirit Plus was rebranded as "Big Front Seat" and business class service was discontinued. For an additional fee, a person could choose "Big Front Seat", or upgrade at the airport. In December 2010, Spirit Airlines introduced the Free Spirit World MasterCard.[16]
On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers.[17] The ultimately successful pilot strike came after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents Spirit's pilots. On June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed, and a tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74% margin, brought the Spirit pilots' compensation and benefits in line with comparable U.S. Airbus operators. Flights eventually resumed.[18] Of particular note, is that this was the first legal industrial action (strike) by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2005 (Polar Air Cargo), and the first passenger airline strike by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2001 (Comair).

2011-present[edit]

In April 2012, citing the airline's strict refund policy, Spirit Airlines representative Misty Pinson announced that the airline would not issue a refund to dying veteran Jerry Meekins, who had purchased a non-refundable ticket between Florida and Atlantic City.[19] The 76-year-old Vietnam veteran and former Marine tried to get his $197 back after learning his esophageal cancer was terminal and being told by his doctor not to fly.[20] The decision caused outrage among veterans' groups and the general public, some of whom threatened to boycott Spirit unless both a refund and apology were issued. On May 4, Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza apologized for how the situation was handled and personally refunded Meekins' ticket. Additionally, the airline made a $5000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project in Meekins' name.[21]
In February 2012, Spirit Airlines established a crew and maintenance base at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.[22] On December 1, 2012, the airline opened a flight attendant and pilot crew base at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.[23]
On Monday, July 1, 2013, a Spirit Airlines jetliner came within two miles of a skydiving aircraft, but was found by the FAA to be in full regulatory compliance.[24] In August 2013, Spirit reached an agreement on a new five-year deal with TWU, who represent the airline's flight dispatchers.
On August 7, 2014, Spirit Airlines began new service out of Kansas City, Missouri to five destinations.[25] In November 2014, Morgan Stanley named Spirit the top growth airline pick for investors.[26]
In January 2016, Baldanza stepped down as CEO in order to relocate from Florida, replaced with former Air Tran CEO Robert L. Fornaro.[27] Fornaro has stated that he's interested in merging Spirit with its main rival, Frontier Airlines.[28] If the 2 carriers were to merge, it would create the single largest ultra-low cost carrier in the Americas.[29]
On February 16, 2016, Ned Homfeld, founder of Charter One, which would become Spirit Airlines, died of treatment complications related to leukemia.[30]
In January 2017, Spirit Airlines announced a major expansion into Pittsburgh, which will become the 61st city in the carrier’s network. Spirit’s first Pittsburgh flights launch May 25, when it begins daily service to both Dallas/Fort Worth and Myrtle Beach, S.C. The carrier will add five more routes – to Fort Lauderdale, Houston Bush Intercontinental, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Orlando – by July 13. Spirit will begin flying from Hartford this year with two routes to Florida and one to Myrtle Beach. Spirit’s first flights from Hartford will begin April 27 when it launches daily flights to Orlando and four-times-a-week service to Myrtle Beach. Daily service to Fort Lauderdale will start June 15. The Florida routes are intended to operate year-round; the South Carolina service will be seasonal.[31]
Service concept[edit]




Spirit Airlines Check In At O'Hare International Airport


Overview[edit]
Spirit follows an ultra low-cost fare model that decouples elements and perks that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who want to customize their itinerary or flight experience pay an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enables the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue.[32] These include having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk,[33] for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.[34]
On October 1, 2007, Spirit began to charge $3 for all drinks.[35] [36] On June 21, 2011, Spirit began charging a $5 fee to passengers who have their boarding passes printed at a check-in desk.[37]
On April 6, 2010, USA Today reported that Spirit would charge for carry-on bags on flights starting August 1, 2010, purchased after April 6, 2010. Bags that fit under the seat and measure 16"x14"x12" are still free but passengers wanting to bring larger bags to put in overhead bins are charged.[38] In October 2011, Spirit reduced the weight limit for checked luggage from 50 pounds per bag to 40 pounds per bag, charging $25 for the first 9 extra pounds, and up to $100 for bags approaching 59 pounds over the 40 pound limit.[36] On June 19, 2014, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to temporarily increase their checked baggage fees. The airline increased the checked bag fees by $2 in order to encourage passengers to bring fewer checked bags. For tickets purchased between 6/19/14 through 8/18/14, the first checked bag fee at the airport is $47, the second checked bag is $57.[39]
In 2011, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags. They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.
In May 2013 Spirit airlines dropped its 1-800 number and switched to a Salt Lake city number (area code 801). Its call center is located in Albuquerque, NM and operated by call center company, Sitel.
Criticism[edit]

On September 17, 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration fined Spirit Airlines $375,000 for violating the agency's consumer protection regulations, including not compensating bumped passengers, violating various rules regarding delayed baggage compensation, and not including fees in advertised fares.[40]
Spirit Airlines has received generally extremely negative reviews from passengers. In January 2013, Skytrax Airline Quality Research downgraded Spirit Airlines to a rating of 2 out of 5 stars.[41]
Spirit Airlines has been accused of racial discrimination against its passengers.[42][43]

Advertising campaigns[edit]

2006

In 2006, the airline released a “Hunt for Hoffa” advertising campaign with the tagline “Help us find Hoffa with our Hunt for Hoffa game and enjoy fares from just $39 each way.” The point of the game was to dig for American labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa’s body by clicking grids on the airline’s website, and “winners” were taken to another webpage, saying "You found Hoffa!" thanking them for assisting the National Spirit Sale Center find the union leader’s body.[47] Within hours of the campaign debuting, the airline received a large number of complaints. The promotion was quickly taken down and changed to another promotion, simply titled Happy Sale. This promotion was later listed as #8 on CNN Money’s 101 Dumbest Moments in Business that year.[48]

2007

In December 2007, the airline released a sale with the acronym MILF, standing for “Many Islands, Low Fares.” Online and TV media picked up on this and noted that MILF was popularized in the movie American Pie. This controversy was covered on CBS and ABC News, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and The O'Reilly Factor.[49]

2008

In April 2008, the airline sent an email to its marketing subscription list announcing “We’re having a threesome. Join us in the fun.” Offering "three sales in one," the email repeatedly proposes the "threesome."[50]

2009

On January 8, the airline reintroduced the MILF Special, described as meaning "Many Islands, Low Fares".
On December 2, shortly after a well publicized car accident involving golfer Tiger Woods, Spirit launched lowered fares in a promotion called the "Eye of the Tiger Sale". Imagery for the campaign featured an SUV crashing into a fire hydrant, with a tiger leaning out the driver's side window.[51]

2010

On February 2, the airline offered the "Many Unbelievably Fantastic Fares (MUFF) to Diving Destinations" promotion. Many of their prominent Caribbean or Floridian destinations were featured.
In June, the airline offered the "Check Out The Oil On Our Beaches" promotion. The ad was in reference to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in United States history.[52]
In August, the airline offered the "Don't Be Blue, Slide Down To Low Fares with Double Fisted Savings". The ad was in reference to an incident aboard a JetBlue flight where a flight attendant deployed an emergency slide and left the aircraft with two bottles of beer. Imagery for the ad featured an opened aircraft door and a flight attendant going down an emergency slide with two beer bottles.[53]

2011

On January 12, the airline offered a promotion entitled "Free at Last! Free at Last! Air travel is Free at Last!", which applied for travel the following weekend, celebrating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Spirit made a "Go south" Valentine's Day themed ad showing a woman in a bikini and placed a candy heart with the initial "VD" on her crotch, poking fun at venereal disease.
Shortly afterwards, Spirit made another Valentine's themed ad comparing a diamond ring to vacation packages (while saying "Why not slip her a big package") then showing a gift box directly in front of a man's crotch.
On June 7, amidst the Anthony Weiner Twitter photo scandal, Spirit offered "The Weiner Sale: With Fares Too HARD To Resist." The email promotion included the subject line "Want To See Our Weiner?"

2012

Spirit capitalized on the Summit of the Americas prostitution scandal by featuring an advert with women in pink bikinis, around an agent implying secrecy, and the slogan "More Bang for your Buck" for flights to Cartagena, Colombia – the location of the scandal – as well as other destinations. Colombian officials complained, and Spirit removed the ad after its scheduled 36-hour run.[54]

History[edit]
Early years (1964-2006)[edit]
The company initially started as Clipper Trucking Company in 1964.[4] The company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc., in 1974.[5] The airline service was founded in 1980 in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One,[5] a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas. In 1990, Charter One began scheduled service from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, to Atlantic City. On May 29, 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines.[6] Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992.[6] Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.[6]
On April 2, 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida.[7] Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began on September 25, 1993.[8] Service at Philadelphia began in 1994.[9] During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.
In Summer 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers' tickets were canceled.[10] The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights.[10] In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor's airline.[10]
Spirit initially had their headquarters in Eastpointe, Michigan (formerly East Detroit) in Metro Detroit.[11] It relocated its headquarters in November 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida in the Miami Metropolitan Area.[12] Prior to the decision to move the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan.[13]
In 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed to fine Spirit Airlines $67,000 for allegedly violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards. Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit's DC9 and MD80 aircraft.
In November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan including a website and dedicated reservation line.
In the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit also began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006, and in 2007 filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela.
In 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.
Transition to ultra low cost carrier and pilot strike (2007-2010)[edit]

On March 6, 2007, Spirit began a transition to an ultra low-cost carrier. Their initial plan was to begin charging US$10 per checked bag for the first two bags, $5 if bags are reserved before 24 hours prior to the flight, in addition to charging $1 for drinks which were previously complimentary.
On June 3, 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases.[14] In September 2008, Spirit began advertising on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.[15]
In May 2009, Spirit pilots overwhelmingly voted in favor of strike action (98% of votes) due to stalled contract negotiations with management. Areas of dispute included compensation, work rules and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest paid Airbus pilots in the United States.
On June 20, 2010, Spirit Plus was rebranded as "Big Front Seat" and business class service was discontinued. For an additional fee, a person could choose "Big Front Seat", or upgrade at the airport. In December 2010, Spirit Airlines introduced the Free Spirit World MasterCard.[16]
On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers.[17] The ultimately successful pilot strike came after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents Spirit's pilots. On June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed, and a tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74% margin, brought the Spirit pilots' compensation and benefits in line with comparable U.S. Airbus operators. Flights eventually resumed.[18] Of particular note, is that this was the first legal industrial action (strike) by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2005 (Polar Air Cargo), and the first passenger airline strike by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2001 (Comair).

2011-present[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2013)


In April 2012, citing the airline's strict refund policy, Spirit Airlines representative Misty Pinson announced that the airline would not issue a refund to dying veteran Jerry Meekins, who had purchased a non-refundable ticket between Florida and Atlantic City.[19] The 76-year-old Vietnam veteran and former Marine tried to get his $197 back after learning his esophageal cancer was terminal and being told by his doctor not to fly.[20] The decision caused outrage among veterans' groups and the general public, some of whom threatened to boycott Spirit unless both a refund and apology were issued. On May 4, Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza apologized for how the situation was handled and personally refunded Meekins' ticket. Additionally, the airline made a $5000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project in Meekins' name.[21]
In February 2012, Spirit Airlines established a crew and maintenance base at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.[22] On December 1, 2012, the airline opened a flight attendant and pilot crew base at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.[23]
On Monday, July 1, 2013, a Spirit Airlines jetliner came within two miles of a skydiving aircraft, but was found by the FAA to be in full regulatory compliance.[24] In August 2013, Spirit reached an agreement on a new five-year deal with TWU, who represent the airline's flight dispatchers.
On August 7, 2014, Spirit Airlines began new service out of Kansas City, Missouri to five destinations.[25] In November 2014, Morgan Stanley named Spirit the top growth airline pick for investors.[26]
In January 2016, Baldanza stepped down as CEO in order to relocate from Florida, replaced with former Air Tran CEO Robert L. Fornaro.[27] Fornaro has stated that he's interested in merging Spirit with its main rival, Frontier Airlines.[28] If the 2 carriers were to merge, it would create the single largest ultra-low cost carrier in the Americas.[29]
On February 16, 2016, Ned Homfeld, founder of Charter One, which would become Spirit Airlines, died of treatment complications related to leukemia.[30]
In January 2017, Spirit Airlines announced a major expansion into Pittsburgh, which will become the 61st city in the carrier’s network. Spirit’s first Pittsburgh flights launch May 25, when it begins daily service to both Dallas/Fort Worth and Myrtle Beach, S.C. The carrier will add five more routes – to Fort Lauderdale, Houston Bush Intercontinental, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Orlando – by July 13. Spirit will begin flying from Hartford this year with two routes to Florida and one to Myrtle Beach. Spirit’s first flights from Hartford will begin April 27 when it launches daily flights to Orlando and four-times-a-week service to Myrtle Beach. Daily service to Fort Lauderdale will start June 15. The Florida routes are intended to operate year-round; the South Carolina service will be seasonal.[31]
Service concept[edit]




Spirit Airlines Check In At O'Hare International Airport


Overview[edit]
Spirit follows an ultra low-cost fare model that decouples elements and perks that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who want to customize their itinerary or flight experience pay an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enables the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue.[32] These include having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk,[33] for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.[34]
On October 1, 2007, Spirit began to charge $3 for all drinks.[35] [36] On June 21, 2011, Spirit began charging a $5 fee to passengers who have their boarding passes printed at a check-in desk.[37]
On April 6, 2010, USA Today reported that Spirit would charge for carry-on bags on flights starting August 1, 2010, purchased after April 6, 2010. Bags that fit under the seat and measure 16"x14"x12" are still free but passengers wanting to bring larger bags to put in overhead bins are charged.[38] In October 2011, Spirit reduced the weight limit for checked luggage from 50 pounds per bag to 40 pounds per bag, charging $25 for the first 9 extra pounds, and up to $100 for bags approaching 59 pounds over the 40 pound limit.[36] On June 19, 2014, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to temporarily increase their checked baggage fees. The airline increased the checked bag fees by $2 in order to encourage passengers to bring fewer checked bags. For tickets purchased between 6/19/14 through 8/18/14, the first checked bag fee at the airport is $47, the second checked bag is $57.[39]
In 2011, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags. They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.
In May 2013 Spirit airlines dropped its 1-800 number and switched to a Salt Lake city number (area code 801). Its call center is located in Albuquerque, NM and operated by call center company, Sitel.
Criticism[edit]

On September 17, 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration fined Spirit Airlines $375,000 for violating the agency's consumer protection regulations, including not compensating bumped passengers, violating various rules regarding delayed baggage compensation, and not including fees in advertised fares.[40]
Spirit Airlines has received generally extremely negative reviews from passengers. In January 2013, Skytrax Airline Quality Research downgraded Spirit Airlines to a rating of 2 out of 5 stars.[41]
Spirit Airlines has been accused of racial discrimination against its passengers.[42][43]

Destinations[edit]

Advertising campaigns[edit]

2006

In 2006, the airline released a “Hunt for Hoffa” advertising campaign with the tagline “Help us find Hoffa with our Hunt for Hoffa game and enjoy fares from just $39 each way.” The point of the game was to dig for American labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa’s body by clicking grids on the airline’s website, and “winners” were taken to another webpage, saying "You found Hoffa!" thanking them for assisting the National Spirit Sale Center find the union leader’s body.[47] Within hours of the campaign debuting, the airline received a large number of complaints. The promotion was quickly taken down and changed to another promotion, simply titled Happy Sale. This promotion was later listed as #8 on CNN Money’s 101 Dumbest Moments in Business that year.[48]

2007

In December 2007, the airline released a sale with the acronym MILF, standing for “Many Islands, Low Fares.” Online and TV media picked up on this and noted that MILF was popularized in the movie American Pie. This controversy was covered on CBS and ABC News, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and The O'Reilly Factor.[49]

2008

In April 2008, the airline sent an email to its marketing subscription list announcing “We’re having a threesome. Join us in the fun.” Offering "three sales in one," the email repeatedly proposes the "threesome."[50]

2009

On January 8, the airline reintroduced the MILF Special, described as meaning "Many Islands, Low Fares".
On December 2, shortly after a well publicized car accident involving golfer Tiger Woods, Spirit launched lowered fares in a promotion called the "Eye of the Tiger Sale". Imagery for the campaign featured an SUV crashing into a fire hydrant, with a tiger leaning out the driver's side window.[51]

2010

On February 2, the airline offered the "Many Unbelievably Fantastic Fares (MUFF) to Diving Destinations" promotion. Many of their prominent Caribbean or Floridian destinations were featured.
In June, the airline offered the "Check Out The Oil On Our Beaches" promotion. The ad was in reference to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in United States history.[52]
In August, the airline offered the "Don't Be Blue, Slide Down To Low Fares with Double Fisted Savings". The ad was in reference to an incident aboard a JetBlue flight where a flight attendant deployed an emergency slide and left the aircraft with two bottles of beer. Imagery for the ad featured an opened aircraft door and a flight attendant going down an emergency slide with two beer bottles.[53]

2011

On January 12, the airline offered a promotion entitled "Free at Last! Free at Last! Air travel is Free at Last!", which applied for travel the following weekend, celebrating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Spirit made a "Go south" Valentine's Day themed ad showing a woman in a bikini and placed a candy heart with the initial "VD" on her crotch, poking fun at venereal disease.
Shortly afterwards, Spirit made another Valentine's themed ad comparing a diamond ring to vacation packages (while saying "Why not slip her a big package") then showing a gift box directly in front of a man's crotch.
On June 7, amidst the Anthony Weiner Twitter photo scandal, Spirit offered "The Weiner Sale: With Fares Too HARD To Resist." The email promotion included the subject line "Want To See Our Weiner?"

2012

Spirit capitalized on the Summit of the Americas prostitution scandal by featuring an advert with women in pink bikinis, around an agent implying secrecy, and the slogan "More Bang for your Buck" for flights to Cartagena, Colombia – the location of the scandal – as well as other destinations. Colombian officials complained, and Spirit removed the ad after its scheduled 36-hour run.[54]

History[edit]
Early years (1964-2006)[edit]
The company initially started as Clipper Trucking Company in 1964.[4] The company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc., in 1974.[5] The airline service was founded in 1980 in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One,[5] a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas. In 1990, Charter One began scheduled service from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, to Atlantic City. On May 29, 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines.[6] Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992.[6] Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.[6]
On April 2, 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida.[7] Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began on September 25, 1993.[8] Service at Philadelphia began in 1994.[9] During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.
In Summer 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers' tickets were canceled.[10] The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights.[10] In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor's airline.[10]
Spirit initially had their headquarters in Eastpointe, Michigan (formerly East Detroit) in Metro Detroit.[11] It relocated its headquarters in November 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida in the Miami Metropolitan Area.[12] Prior to the decision to move the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan.[13]
In 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed to fine Spirit Airlines $67,000 for allegedly violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards. Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit's DC9 and MD80 aircraft.
In November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan including a website and dedicated reservation line.
In the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit also began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006, and in 2007 filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela.
In 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.
Transition to ultra low cost carrier and pilot strike (2007-2010)[edit]

On March 6, 2007, Spirit began a transition to an ultra low-cost carrier. Their initial plan was to begin charging US$10 per checked bag for the first two bags, $5 if bags are reserved before 24 hours prior to the flight, in addition to charging $1 for drinks which were previously complimentary.
On June 3, 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases.[14] In September 2008, Spirit began advertising on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.[15]
In May 2009, Spirit pilots overwhelmingly voted in favor of strike action (98% of votes) due to stalled contract negotiations with management. Areas of dispute included compensation, work rules and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest paid Airbus pilots in the United States.
On June 20, 2010, Spirit Plus was rebranded as "Big Front Seat" and business class service was discontinued. For an additional fee, a person could choose "Big Front Seat", or upgrade at the airport. In December 2010, Spirit Airlines introduced the Free Spirit World MasterCard.[16]
On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers.[17] The ultimately successful pilot strike came after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents Spirit's pilots. On June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed, and a tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74% margin, brought the Spirit pilots' compensation and benefits in line with comparable U.S. Airbus operators. Flights eventually resumed.[18] Of particular note, is that this was the first legal industrial action (strike) by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2005 (Polar Air Cargo), and the first passenger airline strike by U.S. ALPA represented pilots since 2001 (Comair).

2011-present[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2013)


In April 2012, citing the airline's strict refund policy, Spirit Airlines representative Misty Pinson announced that the airline would not issue a refund to dying veteran Jerry Meekins, who had purchased a non-refundable ticket between Florida and Atlantic City.[19] The 76-year-old Vietnam veteran and former Marine tried to get his $197 back after learning his esophageal cancer was terminal and being told by his doctor not to fly.[20] The decision caused outrage among veterans' groups and the general public, some of whom threatened to boycott Spirit unless both a refund and apology were issued. On May 4, Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza apologized for how the situation was handled and personally refunded Meekins' ticket. Additionally, the airline made a $5000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project in Meekins' name.[21]
In February 2012, Spirit Airlines established a crew and maintenance base at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.[22] On December 1, 2012, the airline opened a flight attendant and pilot crew base at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.[23]
On Monday, July 1, 2013, a Spirit Airlines jetliner came within two miles of a skydiving aircraft, but was found by the FAA to be in full regulatory compliance.[24] In August 2013, Spirit reached an agreement on a new five-year deal with TWU, who represent the airline's flight dispatchers.
On August 7, 2014, Spirit Airlines began new service out of Kansas City, Missouri to five destinations.[25] In November 2014, Morgan Stanley named Spirit the top growth airline pick for investors.[26]
In January 2016, Baldanza stepped down as CEO in order to relocate from Florida, replaced with former Air Tran CEO Robert L. Fornaro.[27] Fornaro has stated that he's interested in merging Spirit with its main rival, Frontier Airlines.[28] If the 2 carriers were to merge, it would create the single largest ultra-low cost carrier in the Americas.[29]
On February 16, 2016, Ned Homfeld, founder of Charter One, which would become Spirit Airlines, died of treatment complications related to leukemia.[30]
In January 2017, Spirit Airlines announced a major expansion into Pittsburgh, which will become the 61st city in the carrier’s network. Spirit’s first Pittsburgh flights launch May 25, when it begins daily service to both Dallas/Fort Worth and Myrtle Beach, S.C. The carrier will add five more routes – to Fort Lauderdale, Houston Bush Intercontinental, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Orlando – by July 13. Spirit will begin flying from Hartford this year with two routes to Florida and one to Myrtle Beach. Spirit’s first flights from Hartford will begin April 27 when it launches daily flights to Orlando and four-times-a-week service to Myrtle Beach. Daily service to Fort Lauderdale will start June 15. The Florida routes are intended to operate year-round; the South Carolina service will be seasonal.[31]
Service concept[edit]




Spirit Airlines Check In At O'Hare International Airport


Overview[edit]
Spirit follows an ultra low-cost fare model that decouples elements and perks that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who want to customize their itinerary or flight experience pay an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enables the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue.[32] These include having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk,[33] for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.[34]
On October 1, 2007, Spirit began to charge $3 for all drinks.[35] [36] On June 21, 2011, Spirit began charging a $5 fee to passengers who have their boarding passes printed at a check-in desk.[37]
On April 6, 2010, USA Today reported that Spirit would charge for carry-on bags on flights starting August 1, 2010, purchased after April 6, 2010. Bags that fit under the seat and measure 16"x14"x12" are still free but passengers wanting to bring larger bags to put in overhead bins are charged.[38] In October 2011, Spirit reduced the weight limit for checked luggage from 50 pounds per bag to 40 pounds per bag, charging $25 for the first 9 extra pounds, and up to $100 for bags approaching 59 pounds over the 40 pound limit.[36] On June 19, 2014, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to temporarily increase their checked baggage fees. The airline increased the checked bag fees by $2 in order to encourage passengers to bring fewer checked bags. For tickets purchased between 6/19/14 through 8/18/14, the first checked bag fee at the airport is $47, the second checked bag is $57.[39]
In 2011, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags. They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.
In May 2013 Spirit airlines dropped its 1-800 number and switched to a Salt Lake city number (area code 801). Its call center is located in Albuquerque, NM and operated by call center company, Sitel.
Criticism[edit]

On September 17, 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration fined Spirit Airlines $375,000 for violating the agency's consumer protection regulations, including not compensating bumped passengers, violating various rules regarding delayed baggage compensation, and not including fees in advertised fares.[40]
Spirit Airlines has received generally extremely negative reviews from passengers. In January 2013, Skytrax Airline Quality Research downgraded Spirit Airlines to a rating of 2 out of 5 stars.[41]
Spirit Airlines has been accused of racial discrimination against its passengers.[42][43]

Destinations[edit]

Advertising campaigns[edit]

2006

In 2006, the airline released a “Hunt for Hoffa” advertising campaign with the tagline “Help us find Hoffa with our Hunt for Hoffa game and enjoy fares from just $39 each way.” The point of the game was to dig for American labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa’s body by clicking grids on the airline’s website, and “winners” were taken to another webpage, saying "You found Hoffa!" thanking them for assisting the National Spirit Sale Center find the union leader’s body.[47] Within hours of the campaign debuting, the airline received a large number of complaints. The promotion was quickly taken down and changed to another promotion, simply titled Happy Sale. This promotion was later listed as #8 on CNN Money’s 101 Dumbest Moments in Business that year.[48]

2007

In December 2007, the airline released a sale with the acronym MILF, standing for “Many Islands, Low Fares.” Online and TV media picked up on this and noted that MILF was popularized in the movie American Pie. This controversy was covered on CBS and ABC News, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and The O'Reilly Factor.[49]

2008

In April 2008, the airline sent an email to its marketing subscription list announcing “We’re having a threesome. Join us in the fun.” Offering "three sales in one," the email repeatedly proposes the "threesome."[50]

2009

On January 8, the airline reintroduced the MILF Special, described as meaning "Many Islands, Low Fares".
On December 2, shortly after a well publicized car accident involving golfer Tiger Woods, Spirit launched lowered fares in a promotion called the "Eye of the Tiger Sale". Imagery for the campaign featured an SUV crashing into a fire hydrant, with a tiger leaning out the driver's side window.[51]

2010

On February 2, the airline offered the "Many Unbelievably Fantastic Fares (MUFF) to Diving Destinations" promotion. Many of their prominent Caribbean or Floridian destinations were featured.
In June, the airline offered the "Check Out The Oil On Our Beaches" promotion. The ad was in reference to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in United States history.[52]
In August, the airline offered the "Don't Be Blue, Slide Down To Low Fares with Double Fisted Savings". The ad was in reference to an incident aboard a JetBlue flight where a flight attendant deployed an emergency slide and left the aircraft with two bottles of beer. Imagery for the ad featured an opened aircraft door and a flight attendant going down an emergency slide with two beer bottles.[53]

2011

On January 12, the airline offered a promotion entitled "Free at Last! Free at Last! Air travel is Free at Last!", which applied for travel the following weekend, celebrating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Spirit made a "Go south" Valentine's Day themed ad showing a woman in a bikini and placed a candy heart with the initial "VD" on her crotch, poking fun at venereal disease.
Shortly afterwards, Spirit made another Valentine's themed ad comparing a diamond ring to vacation packages (while saying "Why not slip her a big package") then showing a gift box directly in front of a man's crotch.
On June 7, amidst the Anthony Weiner Twitter photo scandal, Spirit offered "The Weiner Sale: With Fares Too HARD To Resist." The email promotion included the subject line "Want To See Our Weiner?"

2012

Spirit capitalized on the Summit of the Americas prostitution scandal by featuring an advert with women in pink bikinis, around an agent implying secrecy, and the slogan "More Bang for your Buck" for flights to Cartagena, Colombia – the location of the scandal – as well as other destinations. Colombian officials complained, and Spirit removed the ad after its scheduled 36-hour run.[54]

					Options and Extras
				
					We believe in only paying for what you use, not what you don't. Control what options you add to your Bare Fare™ and never pay for someone else's "free" bags.
				


 One personal item is included with a Bare Fare.
This is something like a laptop bag or purse smaller than 18"x14"x8". You need to pay for any additional/larger bags.

						Every customer has the opportunity to select their favorite spot on the plane. Maybe you want a sweet window seat or an aisle up front - go for it. If you don't select a seat we'll assign random seats at check-in for free, but we can't guarantee that you will get to sit with your friends or family. And for those who want some space to stretch out, grab a Big Front Seat: wider seat, extra legroom, and an even more comfortable flight.

        Your Confirmation Code
    

       Your Spirit Confirmation Code is a 6 character alphanumeric combination, for example ABC123. 
       Please select where you booked and then read about where your Confirmation Code can be located.
    

       If you booked with a third party not listed below, your confirmation email from them should 
       contain a 6 character code that may be referred to as a Confirmation Code or record locator.
    

 Well played, you – coming straight to spirit.com for our ultra-low fares!
 You'll find your Confirmation Code clearly highlighted near the top of your confirmation email that we sent shortly after booking,
                 or directly beneath the "Check-In Online" button on your check-in reminder email.




On Expedia's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code underneath the word "Confirmed" in the blue bar that highlights your flight itinerary.
Remember, the itinerary number listed at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com




On Priceline's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code in the Airline Confirmation Numbers section, directly below the Flight Numbers section.
Remember, the trip number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com




On CheapOair's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code further down in the Flight Summary section under "Airline Confirmation".
Remember, the booking number shown at the top of your email cannot be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com




On Orbitz's confirmation email, you'll find your 6 character Confirmation Code directly below the "Record Locator" heading at the top of the email.
Remember, neither the Airline Ticket Number or Orbitz Record Locator number shown later in your email can be used to access your reservation at Spirit.com

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
