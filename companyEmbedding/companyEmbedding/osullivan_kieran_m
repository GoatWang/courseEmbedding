Two different panels were set up in order to compare the efficiency of FP with conventional profile on the same 14 products (red fruit jams). The 2 procedures produced similar information both in respect to the way the jams grouped and differed from another. However, FP proved to be faster than conventional profile but less self-explanatory from a semantic point of view. Flash profile appears to be an interesting alternative method to evaluate quickly an array of products.
