Tanger's Moat Is Wide And So Is The Discount - Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (NYSE:SKT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Tanger's Moat Is Wide And So Is The DiscountJul.24.17 | About: Tanger Factory (SKT) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummary"Outlet stores are a fixture of the American retail landscape." Donald K. Ngwe, Harvard Professor.Outlet stores may actually enable the firm to improve its regular store products, which typically form the basis of a fashion brand’s image.I consider Tanger the “quintessential BARGAIN."As Donald K. Ngwe, Assistant Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, explains: Outlet stores offer attractive prices at locations far from central shopping districts. They form a large and growing component of many firms’ retailing strategies, particularly in the fashion industry. In a research paper, Ngwe uses a structural demand model to show that consumers are segmented according to their sensitivity to travel distance and taste for product newness. He then developed a supply model to predict product development responses to changes in store locations. He writes: Through policy simulations, I discover that the firm uses outlet stores to serve lower-value consumers who self-select by traveling to outlet stores from central shopping districts. The firm sells older, less desirable merchandise through outlet stores to prevent cannibalization of regular store revenues by means of exploiting the positive correlation between consumers’ travel sensitivity and taste for new products. Ngwe found that the rate of new product introduction in regular stores would fall by 16% if outlet stores were closed down while variable profits would decline by 23%. “These results imply that the existence of outlet stores may enable firms to improve quality in their regular channels, thus counteracting brand dilution effects.” Ngwe’s research report was just what I was looking for as a means to understand the sustainability of the outlet store business model. As many of you know, I am highly bullish with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (NYSE:SKT), a pure-play Outlet Center REIT that gets lumped into the Mall REIT sector. As Ngwe writes:  Outlet stores are a fixture of the American retail landscape. These brick-and-mortar stores offer deep discounts in locations far away from most consumers. Firms operate outlet stores in addition to regular stores, which are located in central shopping districts. Outlet stores operated by different firms are often agglomerated in sprawling outlet malls off interstate highways. As of March 2014, there were 201 outlet malls in North America, which generated an estimated $31-42 billion in annual revenues (Humphers 2014). This is a large and growing portion of the total retail sales in clothing and clothing accessories, which amounted to $241 billion in 2012. 
 Ngwe’s paper is based on his dissertation and the research is exceptionally granular; however, I will provide you with his closing arguments:  This paper shows that outlet stores provide several benefits as a tool of price discrimination. Outlet stores allow the firm to serve lower-value consumers without lowering prices faced by its regular store clientèle. By stocking outlet stores with less desirable products, the firm exploits the positive correlation between consumers’ travel sensitivity and taste for quality. Prices are low in outlet stores, but not low enough to attract consumers who value quality and convenience the most… Outlet stores may actually enable the firm to improve its regular store products, which typically form the basis of a fashion brand’s image… Outlet stores constitute a single aspect of a consolidated selling strategy that has become standard among fashion goods firms. Other parts of this strategy include price skimming, targeted coupons, and loyalty programs. Many of these components operate on the intertemporal dimension of durable goods demand.  

 Tanger Has No Exposure to Department Stores As noted above, Tanger is not a traditional Mall REIT, instead, the North Carolina-based company owns 44 outlet centers in the U.S. (22 states) and Canada. The company commenced operations over 34 years ago in Burlington, NC, when the outlet industry was unknown. This original concept was aimed to connect bargain-hunting consumers with brand-name manufacturers and Tanger's pioneering platform was the spark for the flaming retail sector that shoppers commonly refer to as the outlet center sector. 


 As the retail industry evolved, Tanger was the first to grasp the retail distribution channel in which goods could enjoy a longer life cycle than the traditional clearance concept. Uncommon to malls that are costly to build (upwards of $100 million) and with significantly higher operating costs, Tanger set out to create a differentiated retail model that could provide both scale and low-price brand recognition aimed to meet the demands of the bargain-hunting consumer. Tanger is the ONLY "pure-play" outlet center REIT, and as you can see below, there are NO department stores in the portfolio: 

 When I think about "Tanger," I think about a stalwart REIT that has performed extraordinarily well through various economic cycles. Tanger's premium brand can be best observed in periods of uncertainty… and it was evident during the recent economic downturn. Unlike many other retail distribution channels, outlets benefited during the recession. Consumers did not have as much disposable income, but still wanted to purchase quality products from brands and designers that they knew and trusted. Tanger has become the "go-to" outlet landlord, and over the years, the company has developed trusted relationships in the outlet sector and the efficiency of driving high-quality tenant relationships across the portfolio, maximizing expense efficiencies by leveraging scale and more sophisticated risk management across markets. One key competitive advantage that Tanger enjoys is the company's ability to leverage its track record and brand by scaling the business model. The outlet industry is small and Tanger estimates that there is less than 70 million square feet of quality outlet space, which is smaller than the retail space in the city of Chicago.
 

 Unlike the traditional Malls, Tanger enjoys a more effective moat-like model that allows the company to grow the portfolio without the risks associated with the struggling department store chains. Many of the Mall REITs have extended into the outlet sector and Tanger has three JV deals with Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) - more on that later. 

 Fortress Balance Sheet As of Q1-17, Tanger's market capitalization was $5 billion and leverage remained low with a debt-to-total market capitalization ratio at 34%. Last year, Tanger had the foresight to convert $525 million of floating rate debt to fixed interest rates (although higher interest spend is expected to have a dilutive impact on 2017 FFO of about $0.05 per share or about 2%). 

 Tanger has always maintained discipline within the balance sheet, as evidenced by the company's floating rate exposure of only 12% of total debt (or 4% of total enterprise value). 


 The average term to maturity for Tanger's outstanding debt was 5.9 years as of Q1-17, and the company has no significant maturities until June of 2020. Approximately 92% of the square footage in the consolidated portfolio was not encumbered by mortgages. 

 Tanger maintains significant liquidity with about $72 million outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit, leaving 86% unused capacity or approximately $448 million. Tanger also maintained a strong interest coverage ratio during the first quarter of 4.22x. 

 Tanger has solid coverage ratios and leverage ratios with limited floating rate debt. The company is rated BBB+ stable with S&P and Baa1 stable with Moody's. 

 Well Positioned for Growth As referenced above, Tanger has no department store exposure, and the company's balance sheet is primed for growth. From an external growth perspective, Tanger has an active pipeline of deals, including recently completed projects in Columbus, OH (opened June 24, 2016), and Daytona, FL (opened November 18, 2016). Tanger has projects under construction in Fort Worth, TX (projected opening late October 2017), and a major expansion in Lancaster, PA (projected opening September 2017).
 

 Tenant demand for outlet space continues for developers with access to capital and the expertise to deliver new outlet projects. Tanger prefers to fund growth using unsecured financing with limited secured financing (to maintain financial flexibility). Tanger's longstanding disciplined development approach remains intact, and the company's underwriting practice requires achievement of 60% pre-leasing and receipt of all non-appealable permits prior to the acquisition of land or commencement of construction (Tanger does not build on a speculative basis). 

 During the first quarter, Tanger elected to terminate a purchase option for a pre-development stage project near Detroit, Michigan, which resulted in a $627,000 charge for abandoned pre-development costs. Tanger did not deliver any new developments between October 2008 and November 2010, and since that time, the company has delivered ten new developments, acquired seven existing outlet centers and sold eight non-core centers. Fundamentals are Sound Tanger's occupancy cost ratio remains the lowest in the mall regroup evidenced by the fact that outlets remain an important and profitable channel of distribution for tenant partners. The popularity of outlets with consumers and retailers, along with Tanger's fortress balance sheet and the strength of its core portfolio, positions the company to weather the current headwinds in the retail environment.
 

 Tanger's Q1-17 AFFO per share was $0.58 and in line with consensus estimates and up 3.6% compared to Q4-16. As evidenced below, Tanger has maintained a very consistent record of AFFO/share growth: 

 Tanger opted to revise its net income per share guidance and FFO guidance by $0.04. The reduction is a function of lower same center NOI and the right to offer pre-development costs for the Detroit Project, partially offset by approximately $2.3 million of lease termination fees ($1.1 million of which the company is expected to be recognized in the second quarter). 

 I consider the revisions consistent with Tanger's conservative risk management practices. Tanger's management said on the earnings call that the company's "initial guidance underestimated the impact of longer downtime, unexpected store closings and lease termination fees." Tanger now expects its AFFO and FFO per share to be between $2.40 and $2.45 compared to a previous forecast of $2.41 and $2.47. One of the most important elements for Tanger's battle-tested brand is the company's dividend history. As illustrated below, Tanger has increased its dividend each year and paid an all-cash dividend every quarter since its IPO:
 

 In April, Tanger raised the dividend by 5.4% on an annualized basis. This was the 24th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend for every year since becoming a public company in May of 1993. The current annualized dividend of $1.37 per share is more than double the 2006 dividend which was $0.68 per share on a split-adjusted basis. 

 Over the last three years, Tanger's dividend has grown at a 30% compounded annual growth rate. On May 15, 2017, Tanger will pay its 96th consecutive quarterly dividend of $.34225 per share to holders of record on April 28, 2017. Tanger's dividend is well covered. In 2016, the FFO exceeded the dividend by over $100 million. Tanger’s Moat Is Wide And So Is The Discount  As viewed below, Tanger has a long history of earnings and dividend growth: 

 However, shares have been battered year-to-date as a result of the growing pressure in retail and continued threat of e-commerce. Here’s SKT’s dividend yield compared with the peer group: 


 As you can see, SKT’s dividend yield is higher than it has been since 2010: 

 Now let’s examine SKT’s P/FFO multiple compared with the peers: 

 Ironically, SKT has many of the same tenants as Simon Property (SPG), General Growth (NYSE:GGP), and Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO), yet SKT does not have the department store risk. In fact, I consider Tanger the “quintessential BARGAIN,” and as far as I'm concerned, this stock checks all of the boxes: (1) Strong balance sheet, (2) strong management team, (3) solid fundamentals, (4) exceptional dividend growth history, (5) brand recognition, and most importantly… (6) an enormous margin of safety. I’m in full agreement with Professor Ngwe that "outlet stores are a fixture of the American retail landscape," and that means Tanger is too!

Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Passes Through 5% Yield Mark

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Friday, shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (Symbol: SKT) were yielding above the 5% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.37), with the stock changing hands as low as $26.20 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 5% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (Symbol: SKT) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc., looking at the history chart for SKT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 5% annual yield.       According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SKT makes up 1943.88% of the iShares Russell 2500 ETF (Symbol: SMMD) which is trading relatively unchanged on the day Friday.

CAUSES (Charitable & Community)


Giving Back


		Being a good corporate citizen is an important part of Tanger Outlet Centers philosophy for success. Each year, through donations and fund-raising efforts at its corporate headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina and at its portfolio of shopping centers across the country, Tanger strives to make the communities it serves better places for everyone to live, work and raise their family. Since 1994, Tanger has partnered with and supported a variety of worthwhile charitable organizations and causes in the hopes of making a difference. Tanger Outlets has now raised and donated over $16.3 million with a primary focus on battling breast cancer and helping children and schools succeed.
	


		Tanger Outlet Centers believes that our children are our biggest and most important asset. They represent the future of our nation. With this in mind, Tanger has worked hard to assist students in pre-school through high school by helping to raise money that is used to purchase books and supplies, computers and new technology, to fund reading programs and educational field trips, to purchase athletic and playground equipment and for many other important educational projects.
	







		Since 1994, Tanger has encouraged and empowered its team members to get out into their communities and join the fight to end breast cancer. Through Tanger's annual Pink Campaign each fall, the company, with the help of its retail partners and customers, has raised more than $14.5 million for the cause. Funds generated by Tanger are donated to twenty different breast cancer organizations through the Stanley K. Tanger Breast Cancer Fund, named in honor of the company's founder, Stanley K. Tanger. We are proud of our efforts in the battle against breast cancer and remain committed to fighting the disease until and a cure and prevention can be found.
	


		Annually, each Tanger Outlet Center ends the year by taking time to recognize the dedicated men and women who serve their communities as members of the Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Departments and others. Tanger honors these brave citizens by making financial contributions to help purchase life saving equipment, to fund community outreach programs and more. Tanger is pleased to support these local heroes.
	


		Since the company's beginning, Tanger has prided itself on being sensitive to our environment. Tanger continues its efforts to be green whenever possible by working closely with its local community leaders, concerned citizens and organizations to help make our planet a cleaner and better place to live.

			Chief Executive Officer
		





OUR MISSION


THINK OUTLETS. THINK TANGER.


		Tanger will continue to be a top performing retail REIT by focusing on operating and developing first-class outlet centers that deliver the following:
		


				Significant savings to the shopper
			

				The latest and most popular retail brands
			

				A customer experience that attracts and retains shoppers
			











OUR HISTORY


LEADING THE WAY.


		In 1981, Stanley K. Tanger (1923-2010) pioneered the Outlet Industry by building the country’s first authentic outlet shopping center in Burlington, North Carolina. This was not only the beginning of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc., but also of a thriving retail venue – the Outlet Industry, which has grown to hundreds of outlet centers worldwide today.
		

		Steven B. Tanger (current Chief Executive Officer as of 2009) joined forces with his father Stanley in 1986 as the company’s fourth employee. Under their leadership, the company prospered and grew to 13 outlet centers by 1992.
		

		Then, in 1993 Tanger led the way again by becoming the first outlet center developer to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Shares are traded under ticker symbol SKT.
	



		Tanger’s Best Price Promise, an Outlet Industry first was originally instituted in 1995. The program offers Tanger shoppers an instant cash refund of the difference if they should find an item purchased at Tanger advertised for less. The Best Price Promise gives Tanger customers’ confidence that they are getting a great deal each and every time they shop.
		

		In October of 2010, Stanley K. Tanger, the company’s Founder died at the age of 87, surrounded by his family. Mr. Tanger’s name was synonymous with outlet centers and he was known as a dynamic businessman, philanthropist, mentor and friend.
		

		Tanger’s portfolio of outlet centers has continued to expand and today includes 43 outlet centers in 22 states coast-to-coast and in Canada. Savvy outlet shoppers look to Tanger Outlets for the biggest selection of first-quality, in-season merchandise, for the latest fashion trends from their favorite brand name and designer outlet stores and so much more. Because consumers love shopping and saving direct from the manufacturer, Tanger centers are major tourist attractions that welcome more than 188 million brand name bargain hunters annually. America knows the value of shopping TangerStyle.
