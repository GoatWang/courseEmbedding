	STRONGBOW RESOURCES, INC.




	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	November 30, 2016







	1.




	NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS



	 


	Strongbow Resources Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 9, 2004. The Company focuses its business efforts on the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties. 





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of November 30, 2016, the Company has not achieved profitable operations, has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses are anticipated. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,314,499.





	The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities when they come due. To date, the Company has funded operations through the issuance of capital stock and debt. Management plans to continue raising additional funds through equity or debt financings and loans from directors. There is no certainty that further funding will be available as needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue operating as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue its operations as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient new capital to fund its operating commitments and ongoing losses and ultimately on generating profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to be recorded to assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	2.




	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	The unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2016 included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the 10-K report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined based on relevant market information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The estimated fair value of cash, receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, amounts due to related party and note payable approximate their carrying value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.





	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value;





	Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;





	Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and





	Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, there for requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumption that market participants would use in pricing.






	9













	The Company had certain Level 3 liabilities required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with US GAAP as at November 30, 2016. As at November 30, 2016, the Companys Level 3 liabilities consisted of warrants and a convertible debenture. The resulting Level 3 liabilities have no active market and are required to be measured at their fair value each reporting period based on information that is unobservable.





	A summary of the Companys level 3 liabilities for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015 is as follows:

	Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Share






	Earnings or loss per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive shares of the common stock that were outstanding during the period presented. There were 6,360,170 (November 30, 2015: 3,680,000) potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.





	The treasury stock method is used in calculating diluted EPS for potentially dilutive stock options and share purchase warrants, which assumes that any proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money stock options and share purchase warrants, would be used to purchase common shares at the average market price for the period.





	Under the if-converted method, EPS is calculated as the more dilutive of EPS (i) including all interest (both cash interest and non-cash discount amortization) and excluding all shares underlying the convertible debt or; (ii) excluding all interest and costs directly related to the convertible debt (both cash interest and non-cash discount amortization) and including all shares underlying the convertible debt.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, 

	Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

	, which is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures. The ASU provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which for the Company is April 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.






	3.




	OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES



	 


	Effective February 21, 2012, the Company entered into a Farmout Agreement (the Agreement) with Harvest Operations Corp. (Farmor). The Agreement provided for the Companys acquisition of an undivided 100% working interest (Working Interest) in a petroleum and natural gas license covering land located in the Compeer Area in the Province of Alberta, Canada (the Farmout Lands).





	To earn the Working Interest the Company was required to drill, complete, equip or abandon a test well on the Farmout Lands (Test Well). On March 14, 2012, the Company obtained operator status and was transferred the well license relating to the Test Well.





	The Companys Working Interest in the Farmout Lands will be held subject to a non-convertible overriding royalty payable to the Farmor (Farmors Royalty).  The Farmors Royalty on net crude oil revenues will be measured on a sliding scale from 5% to 15% over a range of production volumes from 1 to 150 barrels per day. The Farmors Royalty on net gas and other petroleum product revenues is 15%.





	The Test Well was spudded on May 27, 2012, and on September 5, 2012, the Company received an earning notice granting the Company a 100% working interest in the Farmout Lands.





	As of November 30, 2016, the Company has incurred $578,989 (February 29, 2016 - $568,151) in exploration costs to drill, complete and equip the Test Well, net of impairment charges in prior periods. The Company also has $32,656 (CAD$43,851) (February 29, 2016 - $32,224 (CAD$43,605)) in bonds held with the Alberta Energy Regulator for its oil and gas properties.

	ACCOUNTS PAYABLE






	During the nine months ended November 30, 2016, the Company issued 353,521 common shares with a fair value of $35,352 to settle accounts payable of $95,584 (CAD$123,733). As a result, the Company recorded a gain on settlement of debt of $60,232. In addition, the Company paid $11,471 (CAD$15,000) in cash to settle $22,942 (CAD$30,000) of balance owing to the former chief operating officer of the Company. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on settlement of debt of $11,471.






	6.




	NOTE PAYABLE






	As at November 30, 2016, the Company had $18,618 (CAD$25,000) (February 29, 2016 - $18,475 (CAD$25,000)) in short term note obligations to an unrelated party. The note payable is unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable upon demand.









	7.




	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION






	The Companys asset retirement obligation consists of reclamation and closure costs associated with the Test Well in the Farmout Lands. The asset retirement obligation was estimated based on the Companys understanding of its requirements to reclaim currently disturbed areas. Significant reclamation and closure activities include land rehabilitation, water, removal of building and well facilities and tailings reclamation.





	The undiscounted estimate of this liability was $37,235 (CAD$50,000) (February 29, 2016 - $36,950 (CAD$50,000)) reflecting payments commencing in 2024.  This estimate was adjusted for an inflation rate of 2.00% and then discounted at a rate of 10.00% for a net present value of $23,724 (CAD$31,857) (February 29, 2016 - $21,900 (CAD$29,660)) as at November 30, 2016.






	8.   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES






	On May 17, 2016, the Company entered into a secured convertible debenture agreement (the Debenture) with the Lender. Under the Debenture, the Lender agreed to lend to the Company $200,000. The maturity date under the Debenture was November 17, 2016 (the Maturity Date). At the discretion of the Lender, the principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Debenture may be converted into units of the Company at $0.20 per unit at any time until the Maturity Date.  Each unit consists of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant.  Each warrant is exercisable to purchase one common share at a price of $0.40 per share for a period of two years. As at November 30, 2016, the Company has not repaid the Debenture and the balance owing was $211,017 including accrued interest of $11,017.





	The conversion feature was determined to be a derivative liability due to the conversion price being denominated in a currency other than the Companys functional currency; therefore, at initial measurement, the proceeds were allocated to the conversion feature and any residual proceeds to the principal.  At issuance date, the fair value of the conversion feature was $199,999 and a value of $1 was allocated to the principal.





	During the nine months ended November 30, 2016, the Company recognized accretion expense of $199,999 (November 30, 2015 - $Nil).





	At November 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the conversion feature was $159,568 (February 29, 2016 - $nil).   During the nine months ended November 30, 2016, a gain on fair value adjustment of $40,431 (November 30, 2015 - $nil) was recognized.





	In consideration for the Debenture, the Company issued the Lender 200,000 units.  Each unit consists of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant.  Each warrant is exercisable to purchase one common share at a price of $0.40 per share for a period of two years. The warrants were determined to be derivatives.  At issuance date, the fair value of the common shares and warrants was $73,831.






	12













	The fair value of the conversion feature was calculated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model at the issuance date, and was revalued at the reporting dates using the following assumptions:

	Corporate Overview






	Our company was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on July 9, 2004.  





	During October 2007 we amended our articles of incorporation to increase the number of our authorized common shares from 75,000,000 to 750,000,000 and to forward stock split our common stock on a 10-for-1 basis. The stock split was based on market conditions and upon a determination by our Board of Directors that the stock split was in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareholders.





	On February 28, 2012, we adopted the assumed name of Big Lake Energy Ltd. for use in the Province of Alberta, Canada. On June 5, 2013, we adopted the assumed name of Big Lake Energy Ltd. for use in the Province of British Columbia, Canada.





	Effective March 17, 2014, we conducted a one-for-four reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, the number of the issued and outstanding common shares decreased from 111,586,705 shares to 27,896,684 shares. Our authorized capital of 750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 was unchanged.






	17














	Our Current Business






	As of November 30, 2016, we have incurred $578,989 in exploration costs to drill, complete and equip the Test Well. We also recorded $23,724 in asset retirement obligations related to the future plugging and abandonment of the Test Well.





	As at January 17, 2017, it is too early to provide stabilized production forecasts.






	Future Development Costs






	During fiscal 2017, we plan to focus on the exploration and drilling of the Farmout Lands, identify and complete additional asset acquisition(s), and pursue joint venture agreements with third parties to explore for oil and gas in Canada and the United States.

	Expenses






	Increase / Decrease in Expenses






	Explanation for Change







	Management fees




	Increase of $104,802




	Increase due to additional management fees accrued to catch up management fees under-accrued in the prior periods.








	Office, travel and general expenses




	Decrease of $25,651




	Decrease due to fewer corporate activities and foreign exchange gain from the appreciation of US dollars.






	Professional fees




	Increase of $20,607




	Increase due to more professional services used for corporate filings, accounting, and professional services.






	Salaries and benefits

	Decrease due to hiring of COO and VP of Exploration in the prior period.

	Decrease due to stock options granted in the prior period.









	For the three months ended November 30, 2016, we recorded a loss on the fair value adjustment of derivative financial liability of $430,673. The derivative liability consists of the fair value of share purchase warrants that were issued in unit private placements that have an exercise price in a currency other than the functional currency of our company. The derivative liability is a non-cash liability as we will not be required to expend any cash. During the same period, we recorded accretion expense of $198,798 related to the convertible debenture debt discount.





	Expenses decreased during the nine month period ended November 30, 2016 to $283,106 as compared to $431,754 during the nine month period ended November 30, 2015.

	For the nine months ended November 30, 2016, we recorded a loss on the fair value adjustment of derivative financial liability of $195,167. The derivative liability consists of the fair value of share purchase warrants that were issued in unit private placements that have an exercise price in a currency other than the functional currency of our company. The derivative liability is a non-cash liability as we will not be required to expend any cash. During the same period, we recorded interest expenses of $211,016 related to the convertible debenture.

	We had cash of $83,768 and a working capital deficit of $1,807,457 as of November 30, 2016 compared to cash of $22,426 and working capital deficit of $1,252,714 as of February 29, 2016.





	We anticipate general and administrative expense, excluding impairment of oil and gas property, if any, will be similar to fiscal 2016 during the upcoming fiscal year.





	Our companys cash will not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve month period. Our company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the issuance of our equity securities. There is no assurance that our company will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements. The ability of our company to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued financial support of our directors and shareholders, the continued issuance of equity to new shareholders, and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.





	There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful exploration of our property interests, the identification of reserves sufficient enough to warrant development, successful development of our property interests and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.





	Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.

	Cash Used in Operating Activities






	Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2016, compared to our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2015, decreased by $14,348, primarily due to significant increase in net loss from operations in the current period offset by the difference in the change in fair value of the derivative liability.






	Cash Used in Investing Activities






	Our cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2016, compared to our cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2015, decreased by $4,628 due to decrease in expenditures on oil and gas properties.






	Cash Provided by Financing Activities






	Our cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2016, compared to our cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2015, increased by $71,969 due to the issuance of secured convertible debenture of $200,000, issuance of 1,150,000 common shares for net proceeds of $118,000, and proceeds repaid to related parties of $ 55,466 whereby in the comparative period, there were proceeds from related parties of $182,959.

	Outstanding Shares, Options, Warrants and Convertible Securities






	As of January 17, 2017, we had 31,732,567 shares of common stock outstanding, 2,300,000 stock options outstanding and 1,950,000 warrants outstanding. In addition, as of January 17, 2017, 1,055,085 shares of our common stock and 1,055,085 warrants are issuable upon conversion of a secured convertible debenture with a principal of $200,000 and accrued interest of $11,017.






	Off- Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.

	Going Concern






	Our interim financial statements and information for the period ended November 30, 2016, have been prepared by our management on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have generated no significant revenues to date and have incurred a net loss of $693,779 during the nine month period ended November 30, 2016, and an accumulated deficit of $4,314,499 from inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue operating as a going concern.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional funds through the sale of debt and/or equity.

	Principal Parties






	Description of Claim









	Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta




	July 23, 2013




	Plaintiff: Baker Hughes Canada Company;                                

	Defendant: Strongbow Resources Inc., also known as Big Lake Energy Ltd.




	A Statement of Claim was filed July 23, 2013, whereby the Plaintiff is suing the Defendant for the sum of CAD$281,267 representing the amount owing for oil-field services and equipment, including cementing and fishing products and services provided by the Plaintiff.


	In December 2015, the Company reached a settlement agreement for a total of $149,784 (CAD$200,000) in eight equal monthly installments of $18,723 (CAD$25,000) starting February 1, 2016. Upon receipt of the final installment, the vendor agreed to discontinue the claim and provide a release to the Company. The Company only made one instalment payment of CAD$25,000 applied against the original claim and the settlement agreement was defaulted. As a result, there was a balance owing of $256,267 as at November 30, 2016.






	Provincial Court of Alberta (Civil)




	January 22, 2016




	Plaintiff: Geologic Systems Ltd.                                

	Defendant: Strongbow Resources Inc.




	A Civil Claim was filed on January 22, 2016, whereby the Plaintiff is suing the Defendant for the sum of CAD$25,514.(plus interest) representing the amount owing for software data and licensing fees pursuant to a license agreement entered into on February 12, 2015.













	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS






	An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this quarterly report in evaluating our company and our business before purchasing shares of our common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. You should invest in our common stock only if you can afford to lose your entire investment.






	23














	Risks Related to Our Company







	We have a history of losses and this trend may continue and may negatively impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.






	We have experienced net losses since inception, and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our accumulated deficit was $4,314,499 as at November 30, 2016. We may not be able to generate significant revenues in the future. As a result, our management expects our business to continue to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, our business might become profitable. We will need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.






	We have a limited operating history, which may hinder our ability to successfully meet our objectives.






	We have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects. We do not have an established history of operating producing properties or locating and developing properties that have oil and gas reserves. As a result, the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven. In addition, because of our limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Errors may be made in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends and we will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.






	Our operations and proposed exploration activities will require significant capital expenditures for which we may not have sufficient funding and if we do obtain additional financing, our existing shareholders may suffer substantial dilution.






	We intend to make capital expenditures far in excess of our existing capital resources to develop, acquire and explore oil and gas properties. We intend to rely on funds from operations and external sources of financing to meet our capital requirements to continue acquiring, exploring and developing oil and gas properties and to otherwise implement our business plan. We plan to obtain additional funding through the debt and equity markets, but we can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when it is required or that it will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing shareholders.






	The successful implementation of our business plan is subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas business, which if not adequately managed, could result in additional losses.






	Our oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration and development activities, including the necessity of making significant expenditures to locate and acquire properties and to drill exploratory wells. In addition, the availability of drilling rigs and the cost and timing of drilling, completing and, if warranted, operating wells is often uncertain. In conducting exploration and development activities, the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration, development and, if warranted, production activities to be unsuccessful. This could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular well. If exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease, the amounts accumulated as unproved costs will be charged against earnings as impairments.









	24













	In addition, market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets and delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our prospective oil and gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and other facilities. Our ability to market such production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, in most cases owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells for lack of a market or a significant reduction in the price of oil or gas or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines or gathering system capacity. If that occurs, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements are made to deliver such production to market.






	Our future performance is dependent upon our ability to identify, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, the failure of which could result in under use of capital and losses.






	Our future performance depends upon our ability to identify, acquire and develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our success will depend upon our ability to acquire working and revenue interests in properties upon which oil and gas reserves are ultimately discovered in commercial quantities, and our ability to develop prospects that contain proven oil and gas reserves to the point of production. Without successful acquisition and exploration activities, we will not be able to develop additional oil and gas reserves or generate revenues. We cannot provide you with any assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional oil and gas reserves on acceptable terms, or that oil and gas deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities to enable us to recover our exploration and development costs or sustain our business.





	The successful acquisition and development of oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors. Such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain. In addition, no assurance can be given that our exploration and development activities will result in the discovery of additional reserves. Our operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of lack of adequate capital and other factors, such as lack of availability of rigs and other equipment, title problems, weather, compliance with governmental regulations or price controls, mechanical difficulties, or unusual or unexpected formations, pressures and or work interruptions. In addition, the costs of exploitation and development may materially exceed our initial estimates.






	We have a very small management team and the loss of any member of our team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.






	We have two executive officers and a limited number of additional consultants upon whom our success largely depends. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on our executive officers or consultants, the loss of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such an event, we may not be able to recruit personnel to replace our executive officers or consultants in a timely manner, or at all, on acceptable terms.






	Future growth could strain our personnel and infrastructure resources, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.






	We may experience rapid growth in our operations, which will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our management to manage growth effectively. This may require us to hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations. In addition, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to execute upon our business plan.






	25














	Market conditions or operation impediments may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production.






	The marketability of production from our properties depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. This dependence is heightened where this infrastructure is less developed. Therefore, if drilling results are positive in certain areas of our oil and gas properties, a new gathering system would need to be built to handle the potential volume of gas produced. We might be required to shut in wells, at least temporarily, for lack of a market or because of the inadequacy or unavailability of transportation facilities. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver production to market.





	Our ability to produce and market natural gas and oil is affected and also may be harmed by:





	·


	the lack of pipeline transmission facilities or carrying capacity;


	·


	government regulation of natural gas and oil production;



	·


	government transportation, tax and energy policies;



	·


	changes in supply and demand; and



	·


	general economic conditions.






	We might incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities, which would continue to reduce our financial flexibility and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.






	If we incur indebtedness, the ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance. General economic conditions, oil and gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our current or future debt or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and performance at the time we need capital. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to make such payments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we might have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.






	Our properties and/or future properties might not produce, and we might not be able to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses.






	Although we have reviewed and evaluated our properties in a manner consistent with industry practices, such review and evaluation might not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. This is also true for any future acquisitions made by us. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, a seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems, and we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired properties.






	26














	If we or our operators fail to maintain adequate insurance, our business could be materially and adversely affected.






	Our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas industry, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution, earthquakes and other environmental risks. These risks could result in substantial losses due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We could be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.





	Any prospective drilling contractor or operator which we hire will be required to maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry. We also have acquired our own insurance coverage for such prospects. The occurrence of a significant adverse event on such prospects that is not fully covered by insurance could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in a particular prospect which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.






	The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and we may not have sufficient resources to compete effectively.






	The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with oil and natural gas companies and other individual producers and operators, many of which have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as companies in other industries supplying energy, fuel and other needs to consumers. Our larger competitors, by reason of their size and relative financial strength, can more easily access capital markets than we can and may enjoy a competitive advantage in the recruitment of qualified personnel. They may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business and handle longer periods of reduced prices for oil and gas more easily than we can. Our competitors may be able to pay more for oil and gas leases and properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of leases and properties than we can. Further, these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct efficient operations, evaluate and select suitable properties, implement advanced technologies and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.






	Complying with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production.






	Our business is governed by numerous laws and regulations at various levels of government. These laws and regulations govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities, the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues. Such laws and regulations may, among other potential consequences, require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling and restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities.





	Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury, clean-up costs and other environmental and property damages, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Prior to commencement of drilling operations, we may secure limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages as well as environmental damage that occurs over time. However, we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability of environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, we could be liable, or could be required to cease production on properties, if environmental damage occurs.





	The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business. Furthermore, future changes in environmental laws and regulations could result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.






	27














	Shortages of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel could delay or otherwise adversely affect our cost of operations or our ability to operate according to our business plans.






	If drilling activity increases in Alberta or Canada generally, a shortage of drilling and completion rigs, field equipment and qualified personnel could develop. The demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews generally rise in response to the increasing number of active rigs in service and could increase sharply in the event of a shortage. Shortages of drilling and completion rigs, field equipment or qualified personnel could delay, restrict or curtail our exploration and development operations, which could in turn harm our operating results.






	We will be required to replace, maintain or expand our reserves in order to prevent our reserves and production from declining, which would adversely affect cash flows and income.






	In general, production from natural gas and oil properties declines over time as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. If we are not successful in our exploration and development activities, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Our future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon our ability to economically find, develop or acquire reserves in commercial quantities.





	To the extent cash flow from operations is reduced, either by a decrease in prevailing prices for natural gas and oil, or an increase in exploration and development costs, and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of natural gas and oil reserves would be impaired. Even with sufficient available capital, our future exploration and development activities may not result in additional proved reserves, and we might not be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.






	The oil and gas exploration and production industry historically is a cyclical industry and market fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas could adversely affect our business.






	Prices for oil and gas tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control. These factors include:



	·


	weather conditions;



	·


	economic conditions, including demand for petroleum-based products;



	·


	actions by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;



	·


	political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and gas producing regions;



	·


	governmental regulations, both domestic and foreign;



	·


	domestic and foreign tax policy;



	·


	the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;



	·


	the price of foreign imports of oil and gas;



	·


	the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;



	·


	the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;



	·


	the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;



	·


	available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;



	·


	the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;



	·


	the overall supply and demand for oil and gas; and



	·


	the availability of alternate fuel sources.






	28













	Changes in commodity prices may significantly affect our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. Price changes will directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Reductions in oil and gas prices not only reduce revenues and profits, but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Significant declines in prices could result in non-cash charges to earnings due to impairment.





	Changes in commodity prices may also significantly affect our ability to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on the value of the properties. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and the exploration and development of projects. We expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future.






	Our ability to produce oil and gas from our properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.






	The business of exploring for and producing oil and gas involves a substantial risk of investment loss. Drilling oil and gas wells involves the risk that the wells may be unproductive or that, although productive, the wells may not produce oil or gas in economic quantities. Other hazards, such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, fires, blowouts, loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well. Adverse weather conditions can also hinder drilling operations. A productive well may become uneconomic if water or other deleterious substances are encountered that impair or prevent the production of oil or gas from the well. In addition, production from any well may be unmarketable if it is impregnated with water or other deleterious substances. There can be no assurance that oil and gas will be produced from the properties in which we have interests. In addition, the marketability of oil and gas that may be acquired or discovered may be influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the proximity and capacity of oil and gas, gathering systems, pipelines and processing equipment, market fluctuations in oil and gas prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, allowable production and environmental protection. We cannot predict how these factors may affect our business.






	We may be unable to retain our leases and working interests in our leases, which would result in significant financial losses to our company.






	Our properties are held under oil and gas leases. If we fail to meet the specific requirements of each lease, such lease may terminate or expire. We cannot assure you that any of the obligations required to maintain each lease will be met. The termination or expiration of our leases may harm our business. Our property interests will terminate unless we fulfill certain obligations under the terms of our leases and other agreements related to such properties. If we are unable to satisfy these conditions on a timely basis, we may lose our rights in these properties. The termination of our interests in these properties may harm our business. In addition, we will need significant funds to meet capital requirements for the exploration activities that we intend to conduct on our properties.






	Risks Relating to Our Common Stock







	A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.






	A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations have been and will be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new properties and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.






	29













	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.






	If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing shareholders.






	Our articles of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of up to 750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares will result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.






	Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities Exchange Commissions penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock.






	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.






	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock.






	In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

	Our common stock is illiquid and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors which are unrelated to our operations.






	Our common stock currently trades on a limited basis on OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group. Trading of our stock through OTCQB is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.

Strongbow Resources Inc. Looks Forward to Upcoming Changes


CALGARY, AB / ACCESSWIRE / November 30, 2015 / Strongbow Resources Inc. (OTCQB: STBR) ("Strongbow" or the "Company") would like to provide an update to shareholders with regards to a possible industry change, which the company is currently working on.
As the oil and gas industry continues to struggle, Strongbow sees no stable fit in continuing with a market that presents a strong downward pressure and no appetite for investment. A variety of junior & major O&G companies are spending a lot of time and money restructuring in hope of survival, with only a dark hole ahead. Strongbow, previously went through a long restructuring stage and now feels its time to enter into a more remote and lucrative industry such as renewable energy and innovated technology. There are many valid points to be involved in the area of clean energy and innovation. Not only is it profitable, but also we can contribute in taking part of reducing the carbon footprint and making a difference in today's environment.
Michael Caetano, President and CEO stated, "We are currently in discussion with a few companies in finding a synergy with their related products. I'm excited about the upcoming changes and believe this will put Strongbow in a better place of interest for most investors and help enhance our shareholder value."
Strongbow will continue to hold its Compeer asset until it finds a suitable buyer and use the proceeds towards its company debit with the hope of being cash positive after all debit has been paid.
Strongbow will update its shareholders as it makes reasonable progress and looks forward to its positive changes.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.
