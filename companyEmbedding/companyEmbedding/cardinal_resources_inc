Overview
The Red Bird System
The Problem
850 million people, or more than one in ten people worldwide, live without access to clean drinking water.  Most of these people live in rural areas or on the outskirts of urban areas, where services are limited. 
Children are most often affected by lack of clean drinking water
Nearly 42,000 people, including more than 31,000 children, die each week because of poor water quality and poor sanitation. It is not only a human health impact - business and the world economy are affected by the availability, cost, and quality of water.
Women and children are kept from work and school in many parts of the world by the daily chore of gathering water
The Solution - Clean water with only sun and salt
The patented Red Bird System is a game-changing approach for bringing clean water to underserved communities around the world. 
People around the world know the value of safe water
There is demand for safe, clean water in both developing and middle-income countries
Our solar-powered water treatment system is a groundbreaking, ruggedized high-tech solution for low-tech environments. The Red Bird System produces tens of thousands of gallons of clean water daily from any fresh water (non-saline) source at a fraction of a cent per gallon. We train local people to maintain and operate the systems, so that safe water will be sustainable for years to come.  Clean, great tasting drinking water and local jobs - all part of the Red Bird System.

Training for installation, operation, and water quality testing
What makes Red Bird Systems unique?
The Red Bird System succeeds where other approaches have not because of unique technology, integration with quality components, and technical support:
During this Red Bird demonstration, women couldn’t wait to sample clean water for their families

Its high output produces enough water for a community.
Automation and controls provide many safeguards for water quality and safety.

Automation for control and safety

The Red Bird System has an integrated pump to take water from the source, granular filters that last for years, on-site chlorine generation, and can pump water to a storage tank up to 30 feet high.

Placing the integrated pump into the source of water to be treated

It is solar-powered and has battery storage so that it can operate through the night.

Battery storage for operation when the sun isn’t shining

Alternatively, it can be operated from a generator or grid power.
Its only routine supplies are rock salt to make up the brine for chlorine generation, and vinegar to clean the chlorine electrode.

To accommodate various communities, we have developed three different Red Bird Systems:
Mobile Red Bird System
Community Red Bird System - 10
Community Red Bird System - 20

Mobile Red Bird
The Mobile Red Bird System is housed in a rugged trailer, and is designed for ready transport and rapid deployment.  It is applicable in situations where potable water is needed from different sources in multiple locations.  The solar array is installed on top of the unit, so set-up time is minimal.  It can be towed with a standard 1-ton pickup truck.  Example applications are for scattered communities or camps, disaster relief, or military installations, where the system is moved from location to location, filling up clean water storage tanks.

Cardinal Resources, Inc.: Stay Away From This Promotion - Cardinal Resources, Inc. (OTCMKTS:CDNL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cardinal Resources, Inc.: Stay Away From This PromotionJan.27.15 | About: Cardinal Resources, (CDNL) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryCardinal Resources was recently featured in a paid advertisement in the Wall Street Revelator.The company's financials are weak and indicate that the company needs to raise funds immediately.A third party paid $670,000 for the advertisement.The company recently switched its name from JH Designs, where it claimed to be involved in interior decorating.Background
Recently, The Wall Street Revelator published a paid promotion for Cardinal Resources, Inc. (OTC:CDNL). The promotion essentially claimed that CDNL is going to make it possible for fresh, clean water to be available throughout third-world countries, and that the company will make a fortune from it. However, the presentation has an important disclaimer that indicates it is a paid advertisement, and if you look at the company's financial situation and past history, it's evident that you would be better off leaving this one alone.
Business
As mentioned before, CDNL claims to be developing water treatment systems. From the company's Plan of Operations section in its most recent 10-Q it reads,
Our Plan of Operations is focused on becoming the global preferred provider of sustainable water treatment systems using a distributed architecture. To meet this goal our plans call for the Company to expand our financial management, technical implementation staff, and market development. Part of our plan is to continue to expand our technologies, and approaches as well beginning with distributed waste water treatment. In terms of expansion our plan is to first have implementation well underway for our three large contracts in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Senegal. We can then move aggressively to close on other opportunities in our pipeline and expand into our next targets of India, Panama, and Southeast Asia.
However, just over a year ago, the company was called JH Designs, Inc. It changed its name on January 16, 2014. Its business is described below as follows,

We provide home staging and interior design services to sellers of residential properties. Real estate agents are our primary customers.
We define "home staging" is the act of preparing the interior appearance of a private residence for sale in the real estate marketplace by the placement of furnishings, including furniture, artwork and accessories, in the residence for the purpose of enhancing the appeal of the residence to potential purchasers of the residence. Our home staging strategy is twofold. We use the interior furnishing of a residence as a device to (I) visually emphasize the best qualities of the interior design of a residence and (ii) make the residence appeal to the highest number of potential purchasers. A residence successfully staged by us will improve the ability of a seller to sell a residence and obtain a higher price of the residence than if the residence were not staged. Our home staging techniques focus on improving a property's appeal by transforming it into a welcoming, attractive product that anyone might want.


Nowhere in any of the company's filings is there any reason or explanation for the sudden change of businesses -- how does a company transition from doing interior design work to providing water purification systems? Where is the motivation for such a change? In many of the companies that I have covered, quick business and name changes are notable red flags, and this company is no exception.
Promotion
Most stock promotions are done via simple one-page email promotions, but this one has a 20-page paid promotion from the Wall Street Revelator, which also recently promoted IFAN Financial, Inc. (OTCPK:IFAN). The front page of the advertisement features a picture of Matt Damon with his head through a toilet seat, and the content of the promotion tries to take advantage of the recent Ebola crisis which has ravaged Africa. Make no mistake, though; the claims are "Bourne" from fiction.

Other ridiculous imagery includes a cardinal sitting on a stack of $100 bills and countless pictures of people holding one dirty glass of water and one clean glass of water. Beyond the outlandish claims and bombastic nature of the advertisement which claims that Cardinal Resources, Inc. is going to "Turn Sand and Salt Into Hundreds of Millions of Dollars," it's important to skip to the end and read the disclaimer; once this is read, it's much more clear what is going on. The disclaimer, in part, reads,
Disclaimer: DO NOT BASE ANY INVESTMENT DECISION UPON ANY MATERIALS FOUND IN THIS REPORT…. Individuals should assume that all information contained herein about CDNL and other companies is not trustworthy unless verified by their own independent research. The Wall Street Revelator and/or its publisher, Andrew & Lynn Carpenter, dba The Wall Street Revelator has received a total amount of thirty thousand dollars in cash compensation to assist in the writing of this Advertisement, as well as potential future subscription and advertising revenues, the amount of which is not known at this time with respect to the publication of this Advertisement and future publications. Resources Kingdom Limited paid six hundred seventy thousand dollars to marketing vendors to pay for all the costs of creating and distributing this Advertisement, including printing and postage, in an effort to build investor and market awareness. If successful, the Advertisement will increase investor and market awareness, which may result in increased numbers of shareholders owning and trading the common stock of Cardinal Resources . Increased trading volumes, and possibly increased share price of the common stock of Cardinal Resources . Resources Kingdom Limited was paid by non-affiliate shareholders who fully intend to sell their shares without notice into this Advertisement/market awareness campaign, including selling into increased volume and share price that may result from this Advertisement/market awareness campaign. The non-affiliate shareholders may also purchase shares without notice at any time before, during or after this Advertisement/market awareness campaign…

There is more to the disclaimer, but the important part is highlighted in bold; The Wall Street Revelator is being paid to advertise this stock, and admits that the information in the "report" is "not trustworthy." Additionally, a third party, Resources Kingdom Limited paid $650,000 for the advertisement, and finally, Resources Kingdom, was "paid by shareholders who fully intend to sell their shares without notice into this Advertisement/market awareness campaign." Additionally, there is no link evident between Cardinal Resources and Resources Kingdom Limited that is disclosed in any of its filings -- if one does a Google search for Resources Kingdom Limited, the only results refer to the promotion done in The Wall Street Revelator.
If that's not a series of major red flags, I don't know what is. However, no analysis is complete without looking at the financials to see if the company's claims are at least plausible in a perfect world.
Financials
According to the company's most recent 10-Q/A filed on December 10, 2014, the balance sheet shows $200,000 in cash, and $1.475 million in receivables, making up for $1.971 million in current assets. The Liabilities section lists $2.28 million in current liabilities, and the company has an accumulated deficit of $2.81 million. As far as penny stocks go, this one has the greatest amount of assets relative to its market cap ($15 million at the time of this writing). However, if we look at the company's statement of cash flows, it's apparent that the company has major near-term financial problems; its operations lost $771,844 in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
Given the company's cash burn rate, it's important to note that there is a Going Concern clause in the 10-Q/A, which reads,
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. However, as of September 30, 2014, the Company had an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficit. In addition, the Company currently has limited liquidity and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

While the financials are not as bad as some of the penny stocks that I have covered, they are not in great shape; the company is going to need additional funding in order to continue its existence.
Insider Ownership
The company's latest 10-K shows that there is substantial insider ownership, as the top three holders own 49.4% of the outstanding shares -- while this is a lot, I'm really interested in how many shares Resources Kingdom Limited owns, as they paid $670,000 for the stock promotion. Unfortunately, there are no filings that indicate how many shares this entity owns.
Recent Price Activity
I'm not much of a chart technician, but I think it's important to note that since the promotion initially came out last week, the price of the stock has tanked from a price of $0.62 on January 15th to a close of $0.14 on January 26th on substantially higher volume. Somebody is selling heavily following the promotion, but it looks like a lot of the people receiving the promotional material are not buying into it. However, it is an expensive promotional campaign, and I think that we will see further promotional material in the coming weeks.
Conclusion
Compared to many of the stock promotions that I have covered, Cardinal Resources, Inc. has something tangible in its financials, although it is bleeding cash and will need additional funding in order to continue operating. The paid promotion reads like a piece of fantasy fiction, and explicitly claims that there are third-party individuals that want to pump up the price of the stock in order to benefit. Additionally, there is substantial insider ownership, and while there is no clear link disclosed in the company's filings between the company and the promoters or Resources Kingdom Limited, it's a major red flag that needs to be clarified by management. Furthermore, the quick name and business changes are troubling and are a common characteristic common to many penny stock schemes. At this time, it's hard to see who is pulling the strings, but I'd definitely stay away from this one.

About





Overview
In October 2004 a committed team of environmental professionals founded Cardinal Resources.  Since that time the Cardinal team has made dramatic progress in achieving its overall mission of delivering Clean Water, Clean Environment, Worldwide.  Working in more than 20 countries, in six languages and on six continents there are no limits to where we will go.
Our passion developed from our world class remediation, environmental assessment and engineering services.  We implemented sustainable solutions that focused on reducing our clients’ environmental footprints, improving their processes and finding new ways to address the most challenging of problems.  We began earning a reputation for going well beyond traditional environmental work and our clients consistently earned a Green Advantage in their marketplaces.
From 2005 through 2009 we began a major shift in our corporate focus as we invested heavily in what is now our pride and joy, the patented Red Bird System.  Following some pro-bono projects our teams completed in post-civil war Liberia, we saw an acute need for communities in the developing world to have a simple, reliable and sustainable method of producing clean drinking water.  Our approach was to design and deliver a rugged, solar powered system which uses no pre-treatment chemicals and very little maintenance. 
From the initial evaluation to the final solution, Cardinal Resources can provide the strategic thinking, technical expertise, sustainable systems, and discipline to appropriately address any environmental challenge worldwide.
Please contact us for more information.
