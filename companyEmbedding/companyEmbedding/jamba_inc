History[edit]




A Jamba Juice store in Santa Clara, California






A Jamba Juice store located along the CityWalk in Universal Studios Hollywood


Before the creation of the company, Jamba Juice was a "senior project" completed by Kirk Perron, an avid cyclist and healthy-lifestyle advocate, at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Jamba Juice was conceived and founded on March 31, 1990 by Perron,[2] who opened his first store in San Luis Obispo, California. He was joined in the business by three friends: Kevin Peters, Joe Vergara, and Linda Ozawa Olds.[3] It was incorporated in 1990 as Juice Club, Inc. in San Luis Obispo.[4][5][6][7]
Jamba Juice acquired all nationwide Zuka Juice, Inc. stores in October 2000.[8] Zuka Juice was founded in Orem, Utah, by Dave Duffin and also was a prominent smoothie company at the time. Since then, Jamba Juice has expanded to become a well known smoothie chain. The first location in New York was at Columbus Circle and 59th Street in the basement of the Time Warner Center and is part of the Whole Foods Market seating area. Other locations include one south of Union Square, Times Square, Tribeca, and one in the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
On August 14, 2003, Jamba Juice agreed to be acquired by Services Acquisition Corp. International for $265 million. A special purpose acquisition company, Services Acquisition is headed by Steven Berrard, former CEO of Blockbuster Inc. Upon the closing of the transaction, the publicly traded Services Acquisition changed its name to Jamba, Inc.[9]
In June 2006, Jamba, Inc. announced that it had completed a $35.0 million convertible preferred stock transaction. The convertible preferred stock becomes redeemable by Jamba, Inc. at the election of the purchasers in June 2016 unless converted earlier and includes an 8% annual dividend. The preferred stock is convertible into common shares at a price of $1.15 per share.
The funding was led by a $19.55 million investment by Mistral Equity Partners, a private equity fund focused on consumer products and services companies, with the remaining $15.45 million investment made by a company controlled by the Serruya Family, a successful entrepreneurial Canadian-based family who founded the Yogen Früz frozen yogurt and smoothie chain. “We are very excited about Jamba and the potential growth opportunities available to the company as it extends the brand through licensing and franchising opportunities,” said Andrew Heyer, managing partner of Mistral Equity Partners. “This transaction complements our focus exclusively on investing in consumer businesses with strong management teams that capitalize on emerging demographic or psychographic trends.”
In December 2008, Jamba began a strategic move to transform the company from a smoothie shop to include a line of wraps, sandwiches, salads, and flatbreads.[10] Jamba currently has over 750 locations in 26 states across the U.S. and a small number of international outlets.
In July 2009, in promoting its new line of products, Jamba Juice was criticized for running an advertising campaign which was described as a "ripoff" of the work of cartoonist David Rees.[11] The ad campaign looked similar to Rees' "Get Your War On" series. Rees was informed of the Jamba Juice ads by a fan who sent in a letter. Rees stated that "Jamba Juice bit my style, with no credit, and it's kind of disrespectful."[11]
In May 2016, Jamba Juice announced the move of its corporate headquarters from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas, over a 6-month period and affecting 120 employees, citing the high costs of living and of conducting business in the San Francisco Bay Area.[12][13]
Product range[edit]
In December 2007, it was announced that Jamba would be partnering with Nestlé to lend its name to a line of healthy, ready-to-drink beverages under the Jamba brand; they would offer two different products: smoothies and juices.[14] On December 19, 2008, a press release from Nestle USA and Jamba Juice announced suspension of Jamba ready-to-drink products due to "...challenges...with manufacturing on a consistent basis, resulting in inventory and out-of-stock issues."[15]
In 2014 Jamba Juice launched its expanded Fresh Juice menu, and began making juices blends to order with fresh ingredients such as kale, beets and ginger.

Innovation Bar


On November 16, 2015, Jamba, Inc. announced the construction of their first concept store,[17] called the Jamba Juice Innovation Bar. Located in the center of Old Pasadena, the Innovation Bar replaced their nineteenth store,[16] which was roughly double to triple the size of a typical Jamba Juice store.[16][18] Alongside the usual serving of smoothies, this location also sold many other foods, including quinoa bowls, artisan hummus toast with vegetables, homemade potato chips, and various vegan foods.[16] It was also the first location to house a WiFi-enabled dining area where customers can watch as their beverages are prepared, or meet up with other customers.[19] Matt Kafka, who is the Senior Director of Operations at Jamba, explained it as a "cool and hip place in Southern California".[16] Inside, the customer is greeted with mirrored wall art with photographs of various fruits, a set of television screens showing various motion video greetings, and what Barbara Bestor, the store architect, explains as "contemporary design".[16] Jamba opened the Innovation Bar on July 14, 2016, during a ceremonial ribbon cutting at 10:00 am PDT.[20] In early January 2017, the store was abruptly closed to the public. Jamba has not made any comments relating to the store closure.

A Jamba Juice store located along the CityWalk in Universal Studios Hollywood


Before the creation of the company, Jamba Juice was a "senior project" completed by Kirk Perron, an avid cyclist and healthy-lifestyle advocate, at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Jamba Juice was conceived and founded on March 31, 1990 by Perron,[2] who opened his first store in San Luis Obispo, California. He was joined in the business by three friends: Kevin Peters, Joe Vergara, and Linda Ozawa Olds.[3] It was incorporated in 1990 as Juice Club, Inc. in San Luis Obispo.[4][5][6][7]

The first location in New York was at Columbus Circle and 59th Street in the basement of the Time Warner Center and is part of the Whole Foods Market seating area.

The convertible preferred stock becomes redeemable by Jamba, Inc. at the election of the purchasers in June 2016 unless converted earlier and includes an 8% annual dividend.

History[edit]




A Jamba Juice store in Santa Clara, California






A Jamba Juice store located along the CityWalk in Universal Studios Hollywood


Before the creation of the company, Jamba Juice was a "senior project" completed by Kirk Perron, an avid cyclist and healthy-lifestyle advocate, at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Jamba Juice was conceived and founded on March 31, 1990 by Perron,[2] who opened his first store in San Luis Obispo, California. He was joined in the business by three friends: Kevin Peters, Joe Vergara, and Linda Ozawa Olds.[3] It was incorporated in 1990 as Juice Club, Inc. in San Luis Obispo.[4][5][6][7]
Jamba Juice acquired all nationwide Zuka Juice, Inc. stores in October 2000.[8] Zuka Juice was founded in Orem, Utah, by Dave Duffin and also was a prominent smoothie company at the time. Since then, Jamba Juice has expanded to become a well known smoothie chain. The first location in New York was at Columbus Circle and 59th Street in the basement of the Time Warner Center and is part of the Whole Foods Market seating area. Other locations include one south of Union Square, Times Square, Tribeca, and one in the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
On August 14, 2003, Jamba Juice agreed to be acquired by Services Acquisition Corp. International for $265 million. A special purpose acquisition company, Services Acquisition is headed by Steven Berrard, former CEO of Blockbuster Inc. Upon the closing of the transaction, the publicly traded Services Acquisition changed its name to Jamba, Inc.[9]
In June 2006, Jamba, Inc. announced that it had completed a $35.0 million convertible preferred stock transaction. The convertible preferred stock becomes redeemable by Jamba, Inc. at the election of the purchasers in June 2016 unless converted earlier and includes an 8% annual dividend. The preferred stock is convertible into common shares at a price of $1.15 per share.
The funding was led by a $19.55 million investment by Mistral Equity Partners, a private equity fund focused on consumer products and services companies, with the remaining $15.45 million investment made by a company controlled by the Serruya Family, a successful entrepreneurial Canadian-based family who founded the Yogen Früz frozen yogurt and smoothie chain. “We are very excited about Jamba and the potential growth opportunities available to the company as it extends the brand through licensing and franchising opportunities,” said Andrew Heyer, managing partner of Mistral Equity Partners. “This transaction complements our focus exclusively on investing in consumer businesses with strong management teams that capitalize on emerging demographic or psychographic trends.”
In December 2008, Jamba began a strategic move to transform the company from a smoothie shop to include a line of wraps, sandwiches, salads, and flatbreads.[10] Jamba currently has over 750 locations in 26 states across the U.S. and a small number of international outlets.
In July 2009, in promoting its new line of products, Jamba Juice was criticized for running an advertising campaign which was described as a "ripoff" of the work of cartoonist David Rees.[11] The ad campaign looked similar to Rees' "Get Your War On" series. Rees was informed of the Jamba Juice ads by a fan who sent in a letter. Rees stated that "Jamba Juice bit my style, with no credit, and it's kind of disrespectful."[11]
In May 2016, Jamba Juice announced the move of its corporate headquarters from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas, over a 6-month period and affecting 120 employees, citing the high costs of living and of conducting business in the San Francisco Bay Area.[12][13]
Product range[edit]
In December 2007, it was announced that Jamba would be partnering with Nestlé to lend its name to a line of healthy, ready-to-drink beverages under the Jamba brand; they would offer two different products: smoothies and juices.[14] On December 19, 2008, a press release from Nestle USA and Jamba Juice announced suspension of Jamba ready-to-drink products due to "...challenges...with manufacturing on a consistent basis, resulting in inventory and out-of-stock issues."[15]
In 2014 Jamba Juice launched its expanded Fresh Juice menu, and began making juices blends to order with fresh ingredients such as kale, beets and ginger.

On November 16, 2015, Jamba, Inc. announced the construction of their first concept store,[17] called the Jamba Juice Innovation Bar. Located in the center of Old Pasadena, the Innovation Bar replaced their nineteenth store,[16] which was roughly double to triple the size of a typical Jamba Juice store.[16][18] Alongside the usual serving of smoothies, this location also sold many other foods, including quinoa bowls, artisan hummus toast with vegetables, homemade potato chips, and various vegan foods.[16] It was also the first location to house a WiFi-enabled dining area where customers can watch as their beverages are prepared, or meet up with other customers.[19] Matt Kafka, who is the Senior Director of Operations at Jamba, explained it as a "cool and hip place in Southern California".[16] Inside, the customer is greeted with mirrored wall art with photographs of various fruits, a set of television screens showing various motion video greetings, and what Barbara Bestor, the store architect, explains as "contemporary design".[16] Jamba opened the Innovation Bar on July 14, 2016, during a ceremonial ribbon cutting at 10:00 am PDT.[20] In early January 2017, the store was abruptly closed to the public. Jamba has not made any comments relating to the store closure.

(NASDAQ:JMBA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Jamba Growth, Sweet Revenues and ProfitsJun.15.07 | About: Jamba, Inc. (JMBA) Wall Street Mayhem Jamba, Inc. (NASDAQ:JMBA) operates a chain of smoothie shops focusing on fresh fruit smoothies with optional vitamin and protein supplements. Operating under the Jamba Juice brand name, Jamba has about 600 locations including full size stores and on-site kiosks. Jamba differentiates itself from other beverage and fast food outlets by focusing on fresh and healthy drinks and food products. 
Jamba, Inc. has a market cap of about $530 million, cash of about $67 million and no significant long term debt.  On June 11th Jamba announced earnings for the first quarter of 2007 of $11.9 million or 20 cents per share versus a year ago loss of $81.5 million or -$3.88 per share. Although these first quarter results included a pre-tax gain of $15.2 million, after backing out this gain the results still handily beat analyst expectations. Revenues increased 22% year over year coming in at $89.4 million.  Jamba opened 26 new stores in the first quarter of 2007. Although Jamba is already expanding at a brisk pace, the long term goal for Jamba is to open over 5,000 stores worldwide. Jamba says that this number can be reached without cannibalizing existing stores by expanding to new areas with residential density of 15,000+ within one mile, average household incomes over $50,000, and strong vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts. Fueled by these expansion plans and increasing same store sales, Jamba is forecasting revenues of at least $600 million a year by 2010.  We think that yesterday’s weak market conditions helped create a rather subdued movement in shares of Jamba after the company reported excellent results for the first quarter. At this point, shares of Jamba are only about 0.5% higher than they were before the first quarter results were announced even though Jamba beat top line expectations by 30% and it appears that Jamba’s growth is accelerating faster than expected.  Currently, 42% of Jamba’s revenues come from “light” users. These light users visit Jamba Juice stores 1 or 2 times a month. If Jamba can entice these light users to visit Jamba Juice 1 more time per month, total company revenues would rise by 10%. 
 In order to increase the frequency of customer visits, Jamba is implementing various new initiatives designed to compliment Jamba’s core competency of healthy, fun, and on-the-go product offerings. A healthy version of a stuffed pocket breakfast product will be offered at select locations starting this summer. A ready to drink bottled product is also in development and should be ready in the second half of 2007.  One of the Jamba Juice stores located in the Bahamas recently started selling salads and other pre-packaged healthy food options. Jamba has reported that sales at this location have been brisk and that the additional food offerings have helped increase customer retention rates and customer visit frequency. Jamba is currently evaluating options for including similar healthy food options in at many Jamba Juice locations.  On the marketing front, Jamba recently partnered with Nike to promote Jamba Juice at marathons and other sporting events. This cross promotion with Nike is typical of Jamba Juice marketing which tends to shun traditional media outlets in favor of grass roots campaigns and viral marketing opportunities.  Jamba hopes to become the world’s leading brand focusing on what the company calls “healthy energy”. The core of the healthy energy concept revolves around fresh fruit high in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, natural sugars, and fiber. Consumers in the US are increasingly health conscious and although fast food chains have attempted to increase healthy food options, Jamba Juice is well positioned to become the market leader for healthy drinks, snacks, and light meals. Jamba does not have to reposition itself to appeal to the health conscious consumer, healthy drinks and food are part of the core concept of the Jamba Juice brand.  Recently companies like Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Buffalo Wild Wings (NASDAQ:BWLD) have seen their stock prices soar due to increasing revenues and profits largely fueled by aggressive expansion plans. Jamba Inc. could be poised to follow in the footsteps of these companies. Revenues jumped in the first quarter of 2007 and analysts expect Jamba to become profitable (without one time gains) in the seasonally strong second quarter. 
 At Wall Street Mayhem we think that the risk/reward ratio for shares of Jamba is excellent at this point. Jamba’s growth should continue to accelerate due to expansion and recent initiatives designed to drive customer frequency rates. Additionally, over 30% of Jamba shares are held short. As seen by the recent moves in Wall Street Mayhem picks Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) and Taser (TASR), high short percentages can create quick surges in share price when companies receive positive news or increased investor attention.  Jamba is poised to report an excellent 2nd quarter for 2007. Revenues exploded in the first quarter and traditionally the 2nd quarter is much stronger for Jamba Juice due to favorable weather conditions. Now is a good time to buy shares of Jamba Juice before the second quarter results and before the short covering starts to accelerate.  The board of directors and the management at Jamba Juice have made quality strategic decisions and they have an exceptional pedigree. Although Jamba is a small company from a market cap perspective, management has extensive experience in food and beverage retail. CEO Paul Clayton is the former President of Burger King (BKC) North America while Board member Craig Foley was the early lead investor in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and was on the board of directors at Starbucks for 15 years. Other Jamba board members also serve on the boards of Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Burger King (BKC), and P.F. Chang’s (NASDAQ:PFCB).  Jamba Inc. is a growth story in its early stages. Although Jamba must increase customer frequency rates to become a highly profitable company, recent initiatives including pre-packed bottled beverages and healthy food products should open Jamba Juice to a wider range of customers while increasing visit frequency for current customers.  With a market cap of only $530 million, rapid growth, and a healthy brand image, Jamba has the makings of an appealing takeover target. If Starbucks wanted to extend their dominance of the beverage industry while improving their appeal to health conscious consumers, Jamba seems like an excellent fit.

Fresh Frozen Foods™ and Jamba® “At Home” Smoothies – Product Recall

UPDATE: 4/28/15
Inventure Foods has issued a voluntary product recall for our Fresh Frozen™ line of frozen vegetables as well as select varieties of its Jamba® “At Home” line of smoothie kits due to finding of Listeria monocytogenes, in its Jefferson, GA facility. This is a voluntary recall, meaning there are no known illnesses linked to consumption of Fresh Frozen IQF frozen vegetables or Jamba “At Home” smoothies at this time. However, Inventure Foods has decided to err on the side of utmost caution and issue a voluntary recall because Listeria monocytogenes was identified within the facility.
Which products are impacted by this pullback?
The following Fresh Frozen Foods (Fresh Frozen™) and Jamba® “At Home” products are included in this voluntary recall. The individual products are identified in the tables below:

 
Jamba At Home Smoothie Kits
The products affected have best by dates from 18 Mar 2016 through 17 Oct 2016 with code dates from 72644AH01 through 71075AH01.
Code Format:
7= JEFFERSON, Production codes starting with 3 are not included in the recall
 


 
What is Listeria?
Listeria is a bacteria that is naturally found in soil, water, dust, etc. Listeriosis is food poisoning caused by eating foods contaminated with the Listeria. Listeriosis can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Have any Listeria cases been linked to this recall? 
There are no known illnesses linked to consumption of Fresh Frozen IQF frozen vegetables or Jamba “At Home” smoothies at this time. The product in question has been pulled from shipping and is being held at our storage facility. In addition, all products listed above have been recalled from stores.
Are any other Inventure Foods, Fresh Frozen™ or Jamba® “At Home” products impacted?
Only the products listed above are involved. It is an isolated incident only impacting the Fresh Frozen™ facility in Jefferson, Georgia. The recall does not impact any of our other frozen berries, fruit or vegetable products, nor does it impact any of our snack chip product lines. Additionally, no other Jamba® branded products are affected.
What has Inventure Foods done in reaction to the recall? 
We take this situation very seriously and we’ve taken proactive measures to be certain that our consumers and distribution partners are aware of the situation. We have been working in tandem with the FDA to further test our facility to be certain no bacteria is present. In addition, we issued a national press release on 4/23/15 in an effort to directly alert consumers. At this juncture we are actively working with the FDA and our distribution partners to confirm that all product has been pulled from the stores.
What if I have already eaten this product? Should I be concerned?
To date, we have found no known sickness linked to consumption of Fresh Frozen™ vegetables or Jamba® “At Home” Smoothies. Regardless, we wish to err on the side of caution, so we urge our customers to return your package to the place of purchase for a full refund.
What if I have eaten this product and believe I’ve become ill?
If you feel you’re experiencing any of the above symptoms of listeria, please promptly consult your doctor.
How do I get a refund?
Consumers who purchased any variety of Fresh Frozen™ IQF frozen vegetables or Jamba® “At Home” Smoothies are urged to return the product to the place of purchase for a full refund. If you have already thrown away your package, you can simply provide a receipt of purchase for full refund. Consumers with additional questions may contact Inventure Foods Customer Service department at 866-890-1004 or email info@inventurefoods.com.

There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
