WATCHMAN Implant for Non-Valvular Afib Stroke Risk 

































































			
			
			See if WATCHMAN
			
is right for you
































 



 




























WATCHMAN Reduces the Risk of Stroke from Non-valvular AFib
					



There’s an alternative to warfarin for people who need one. It’s called WATCHMAN. The only FDA-approved implant proven to reduce stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem (also referred to as non-valvular AFib). Watch the video to learn more and talk to your cardiologist about WATCHMAN.







 
























See How WATCHMAN Works ►






 







































 



















Beyond Blood Thinners
					



People with AFib often face the lifelong use of blood thinners to reduce their risk of stroke. WATCHMAN is a one-time procedure with a proven safety record.1,2



See What Makes WATCHMAN Different







 





























For All the Right Reasons
					



WATCHMAN effectively reduces the risk of stroke—without the risk of bleeding that can come with the long-term use of warfarin (the most common blood thinner).2,3



See Why People Choose WATCHMAN






 




























 





















As a one-time procedure, WATCHMAN can be an affordable choice compared to years of daily warfarin.4



Get Cost & Coverage Details









The average person with AFib is 5 times more likely to suffer a stroke than someone with a regular heartbeat.5



Learn About AFib & Stroke Risk































WATCHMAN is for people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem who need an alternative to warfarin. This website is intended to provide patients and caregivers with some information about the WATCHMAN Implant. It may help prepare you for talking to your doctor about your options for reducing stroke risk.













Important Safety Information 
The WATCHMAN Device is a permanent implant designed to close the left atrial appendage in the heart in an effort to reduce the risk of stroke.

With all medical procedures there are risks associated with the implant procedure and the use of the device. The risks include but are not limited to accidental heart puncture, air embolism, allergic reaction, anemia, anesthesia risks, arrhythmias, AV (Arteriovenous) fistula, bleeding or throat pain from the TEE (Trans Esophageal Echo) probe, blood clot or air bubbles in the lungs or other organs, bruising at the catheter insertion site, clot formation on the WATCHMAN™ Closure Device, cranial bleed, excessive bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, groin puncture bleed, hypotension, infection/pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pulmonary vein obstruction, renal failure, stroke, thrombosis and transient ischemic attack. In rare cases death can occur.

Be sure to talk with your doctor so that you thoroughly understand all of the risks and benefits associated with the implantation of the WATCHMAN Device.

Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology.
Boston Scientific is primarily known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open clogged arteries.[3] With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD).[4][5]

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]


Companies portal


In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]


Companies portal


In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]
Profits rose to €887 million in 2015 in the Irish-based plant. In 2014 the profits were €766.65 million.[15] Profits increased by 13.57% in one year.

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]

In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]
Profits rose to €887 million in 2015 in the Irish-based plant. In 2014 the profits were €766.65 million.[15] Profits increased by 13.57% in one year.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBoston ScientificBoston ScientificBoston Scientific is a Massachusetts-based company that manufactures products for various medical uses. By 2017, the company had developed more than 13,000 medical products marketed in 100 countries around the world.Jump To TopicHistoryGrowth Slows & Guidant PurchaseResuscitating Boston ScientificRevolutionary Medical DevicesLawsuits & RecallsJump To TopicSelect TopicHistoryGrowth Slows & Guidant PurchaseResuscitating Boston ScientificRevolutionary Medical DevicesLawsuits & RecallsEstablished: 1979
Headquarters: Marlborough, Mass.
Founder: John Abele and Pete Nicholas
Size: 25,000 employees
Popular Products: Taxus Express², Stent, Synergy Stents, WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device
2016 Revenue: $9.1 billion
Boston Scientific is a Massachusetts-based medical device company with a focus on noninvasive treatment – primarily of cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, digestive, urological and pelvic conditions. Its first major product was an angioplasty balloon for cardiovascular treatments, introduced in the late-1970s. By 2017, the company had developed more than 13,000 medical products marketed in 100 countries around the world.
Its business structure is built around three sectors: cardiovascular, rhythm management (cardiac management and electrophysiology), and MedSurg, or medical and surgical (endoscopy, urology, pelvic health, and neuromodulation – a form of central nervous system treatment).
Boston Scientific's Northwest Technology Center 
In 2015, revenue was pretty evenly distributed across the three segments, and roughly 52 percent of Boston Scientific’s revenue was generated in the U.S. In its 2016 annual report, the company reported $347 million in income on $9.1 billion in total revenue, the first time since 2011 Boston Scientific had not posted a net loss.
Boston Scientific experienced significant financial and litigation issues in the mid-2000s that continued to affect its bottom line for most of a decade. By the mid-2010s, the company was believed to have turned a corner through restructuring of the organization and addressing legal claims from individuals and the federal government through a series of high profile settlements.
By 2015, Boston Scientific claimed that a doctor used one of its devices every 16 seconds to treat peripheral artery disease and a patient was treated every 21 seconds with one of its urology products.
But Boston Scientific has recalled some of its products, sometimes in what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has categorized as Class I recalls. These are “situations in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.”
Boston Scientific’s History: Innovation and Acquisitions
John Abele and Pete Nicholas founded Boston Scientific in 1979 with a vision of advancing low-cost, less invasive surgical and treatment procedures.
Their early focus made the company a pioneer of medical devices used in angioplasty – the surgical repair of blocked or narrowed blood vessels, particularly coronary arteries. One of the company’s first devices was a peripheral angioplasty balloon that could be inserted in blood vessels and inflated to expand the vessel and alleviate blockage. The device cemented Boston Scientific as a manufacturer of cardiovascular devices and helped underwrite the company’s growth.






One of Boston Scientific’s first devices was the peripheral angioplasty balloon
In 1981, Boston Scientific acquired Endo-Tech, the company’s biggest competitor in producing accessories for endoscopes. In 1988, it acquired stent-maker Van-Tech. The acquisitions allowed the company to expand its reach across medical device markets affecting cardiology, pulmonary, urology and gastroenterology fields.
The company went public in 1992 and saw continued growth through the decade. By 1997, Boston Scientific had acquired nine additional companies and reported $1.8 billion in revenue for the year.
In 2004, the company acquired Advanced Bionics, which built neuromodulation devices – devices that treat disease by enhancing or suppressing activity in the central nervous system.
In 2003, the company’s Taxus Express2 stent was approved in Europe. When it received FDA approval in 2004, the company already had roughly 200,000 units ready to ship in the U.S. In 2005, the Boston Globe called the stent Boston Scientific’s “most important product ever” from a business standpoint.
The Taxus Express2 is a stainless steel stent with a polymer coating. Stents work to expand a narrowed artery or vein, but sometimes the vessels will narrow again even after a stent is implanted. The Taxus system includes a medication built into its design to prevent the blood vessels from renarrowing. The drug – paclitaxel – is added to a polymer coating on the stent and is slowly released over about two weeks after the stent is implanted.

Fact
The Taxus system was only the second device of its kind on the market, and an important new product for Boston Scientific.

Boston Scientific closed three plants and laid-off thousands of workers to come up with part of the $350 million it needed to develop the device. The Taxus system was only the second device of its kind on the market, and an important new product for Boston Scientific. But its roll out was marred by a partial recall of 85,000 of the devices.
To install the stent, a catheter is threaded through blood vessels to the point that needs expanding. Then the stent is pushed through a catheter, into place in the narrowed vessel. A balloon inside the stent expands, enlarging the diameter of the stent to widen the vein or artery. Normally, the balloon deflates and is withdrawn back out the catheter, leaving the stent in place. But some of the balloons failed to deflate, leading to the recall.
Despite the recall, the device was a huge success for the company and helped drive up Boston Scientific’s profits more than five-fold in 2004.
Boston Scientific’s Growth Slows to a Crawl with Guidant Purchase
The Taxus Express2 was a gamble that paid off in a big way for Boston Scientific. But another gamble would leave the company reeling for nearly a decade.
In 2006, Boston Scientific acquired Guidant for $27.2 billion, the largest acquisition to date. Guidant produced cardiovascular devices including implantable defibrillators and pacemakers.
In 2016, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the Guidant purchase was a long-term, and costly, problem for Boston Scientific. Business analysts said the company overpaid for Guidant, partly because of a bidding war with Johnson & Johnson driving up the price, and partly because there was no growth in its market sector. In addition, executives at Guidant hid problems with the company’s defibrillators before the sale.


According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the purchase of Guidant was a long-term, and costly, problem for Boston Scientific.

Faulty capacitors in some of the devices caused their batteries to drain prematurely. This could result in patient death if the devices were unable to work properly.
After the acquisition, Boston Scientific was left to deal with the results and expenses when the problems came to light. In 2011, Guidant LLC pleaded guilty to federal misdemeanor charges of concealing the capacitor problems from the FDA, and Boston Scientific paid its $254 million in criminal fines to the federal government.
In 2015, Boston Scientific settled a $7 billion lawsuit Johnson & Johnson filed against it over a dispute about how the Guidant acquisition turned out. Johnson & Johnson had claimed it had made a deal with Guidant to purchase the company, but Guidant broke its contract when Boston Scientific made a better offer.
The case had already cost Boston Scientific millions in legal fees and the prospect of losing in court had hung over the company’s financial planning for years. Boston Scientific paid $600 million to its former bidding war rival to settle the lawsuit.
Boston Scientific was also saddled with Internal Revenue Service penalties and interest over the Guidant purchase. In 2016, the company settled a $1.3 billion tax dispute with the IRS for $275 million plus interest, all to be paid by mid-2018.
The Guidant acquisition marked a turning point in Boston Scientific’s history.
Even as it was dealing with the mounting expenses from Guidant, Boston Scientific was being hit with thousands of product liability lawsuits over Boston Scientific’s transvaginal mesh (TVM). Boston Scientific reported a net profit in only two of the next ten years and went through multiple CEOs, lay-offs and restructurings before appearing to turn a corner in the 2010s.
Resuscitating Cardio Giant Boston Scientific
The business built on cardiovascular devices in the 1970s needed business CPR by the 2000s. Following the Guidant purchase and the baggage that came with it, Boston Scientific saw its market value plummet 78 percent. Product development and acquisitions had been disrupted and management was shaken by rapid turnovers. The company went through three CEOs in five years before Mike Mahoney, formerly with rival Johnson & Johnson, took the helm in 2012.

Did you know
Mike Mahoney took the helm of Boston Scientific in 2012, stabilizing the company and returning it to profitability by 2016.

As President, Chairman and CEO, Mahoney restructured Boston Scientific management in an effort to stabilize the company. At the same time, he saw Boston Scientific bogged down by expensive legal, management and regulatory distractions and sought to return the company’s focus to developing new devices and acquiring new companies – the hallmarks of its former success. He also acted quickly to reduce potential litigation costs, seeking settlements in a 15-year running legal battle with the IRS and Johnson & Johnson’s $7 billion lawsuit over the Guidant purchase and with nearly 40,000 patients suing over TVM.
As the company recovered financially, Boston Scientific began expansion into Chinese and Indian markets and acquired more companies with a focus on urology and cardiovascular products. Boston Scientific’s recent acquisitions have been restrained, going for smaller companies that can easily fit into its existing market sectors instead of attempting large takeovers and market expansions like the Guidant purchase.
By 2016, Boston Scientific was not only returning to profitability but was seen by some business analysts as a potential takeover prize itself.
Revolutionary Medical Devices, a Boston Scientific Signature
Boston Scientific has a record of developing revolutionary medical devices. In recent years, these have included modifications of its traditional products and designing devices that take the place of the drugs used in current medical treatments.
Advances on the Taxus drug-eluting stent include the Promus Element Plus, a platinum and chromium stent with a new generation drug element to prevent renarrowing of blood vessels. The company’s Eluvia drug-eluting vascular stent, not yet available in the U.S., was undergoing clinical trials into 2017. Boston Scientific claims the trials have “unprecedented results” after two years of study.
The company’s Alair bronchial thermoplasty system is billed as “the first and only” non-drug treatment for adults with severe asthma. A thin tube is threaded into the patient’s mouth or nose, along airways into the lungs. An electrode extends, heating targeted parts of the airways, reducing smooth muscle and limiting the passages’ contractions during an asthma attack.

Boston Scientific’s Watchman device is placed in a portion of the heart’s top left chamber, pictured above
The Watchman Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) closure device is meant to be an alternative to blood thinners for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Arterial fibrillation (AF) is the most common kind of irregular heartbeat. NVAF is a sub-category of AF in which the heart rhythm disturbance happens without certain heart valve diseases, a prosthetic heart valve or surgical heart repairs.
Treating these patients with the anticoagulant warfarin can reduce their chance of stroke by 68 percent. But blood thinners come with complications, including the risk of uncontrolled bleeding.
The Watchman is a small, cage-like device that is placed in the LAA – a portion of the heart’s top left chamber called the left atrium. The device is inserted through a noninvasive catheter procedure. It closes off the appendage where blood clots are likely to form, possibly reducing the risk of stroke and allowing the patient to stop taking anticoagulants.
Lawsuits and Recalls Hurt Boston Scientific’s Bottom Line
Revolutionary medical devices sometimes come with high risks. Some other Boston Scientific devices on the cutting edge of technology have also been the subject of recalls and thousands of product liability lawsuits in recent years, resulting in billions in lost revenue.
Transvaginal Meshes
In 1999, Boston Scientific received FDA approval for the first transvaginal mesh (TVM) marketed in the U.S. The company would recall its ProteGen TVM just three years later, after a study found half of all women implanted with it developed serious health problems.

From 2014 through 2016, Boston Scientific annual reports showed more than $2.9 billion in litigation-related charges, largely related to transvaginal mesh (TVM) cases and claims.
In 2014 and 2015, juries returned four verdicts totaling more than $218 million in favor of plaintiffs who sued over Boston Scientific’s TVM. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2015, the company announced it would pay roughly $119 million to resolve 2,970 cases.
By November 2016, the company said it had settled roughly 19,000 of the roughly 40,000 lawsuits over three versions of its TVM and five versions of transvaginal slings. Boston Scientific’s 2016 annual report said that the company had spent $806 million in litigation charges for the year, which included “primarily amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims.”

Implantable Defibrillators
In 2007, the year after acquiring Guidant, Boston Scientific recalled 73,000 implantable heart devices manufactured by its new acquisition. The implantable defibrillators and defibrillator/pacemaker combination devices had faulty capacitors. This could cause batteries to drain sooner than expected, putting patients’ lives at danger.
Heart Valve Systems
In 2014 and 2016, Boston Scientific recalled several units of its first-generation Lotus heart valve systems for various problems. The 2016 recall followed three patient deaths in Europe.
In 2017, the company again recalled its Lotus devices, this time due to a manufacturing defect that made some of the devices difficult to implant. The recall did not affect those devices already implanted. The cumulative recalls raised investor concerns about Boston Scientific’s ability to crack the market for the product, dominated by two competitors – Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic Plc.
The recall included the new Lotus Edge devices in Europe, and caused the company to delay its marketing application for U.S. approval for the Edge versions.
The recall was a financial setback for the company, expected to keep the devices off the market for at least half a year in Europe and delay marketing the devices in the U.S. for a year. The Lotus devices had been expected to bring in up to $125 million in revenue for Boston Scientific in 2017 before the recall.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

WATCHMAN Implant for Non-Valvular Afib Stroke Risk 

































































			
			
			See if WATCHMAN
			
is right for you
































 



 




























WATCHMAN Reduces the Risk of Stroke from Non-valvular AFib
					



There’s an alternative to warfarin for people who need one. It’s called WATCHMAN. The only FDA-approved implant proven to reduce stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem (also referred to as non-valvular AFib). Watch the video to learn more and talk to your cardiologist about WATCHMAN.







 
























See How WATCHMAN Works ►






 







































 



















Beyond Blood Thinners
					



People with AFib often face the lifelong use of blood thinners to reduce their risk of stroke. WATCHMAN is a one-time procedure with a proven safety record.1,2



See What Makes WATCHMAN Different







 





























For All the Right Reasons
					



WATCHMAN effectively reduces the risk of stroke—without the risk of bleeding that can come with the long-term use of warfarin (the most common blood thinner).2,3



See Why People Choose WATCHMAN






 




























 





















As a one-time procedure, WATCHMAN can be an affordable choice compared to years of daily warfarin.4



Get Cost & Coverage Details









The average person with AFib is 5 times more likely to suffer a stroke than someone with a regular heartbeat.5



Learn About AFib & Stroke Risk































WATCHMAN is for people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem who need an alternative to warfarin. This website is intended to provide patients and caregivers with some information about the WATCHMAN Implant. It may help prepare you for talking to your doctor about your options for reducing stroke risk.













Important Safety Information 
The WATCHMAN Device is a permanent implant designed to close the left atrial appendage in the heart in an effort to reduce the risk of stroke.

With all medical procedures there are risks associated with the implant procedure and the use of the device. The risks include but are not limited to accidental heart puncture, air embolism, allergic reaction, anemia, anesthesia risks, arrhythmias, AV (Arteriovenous) fistula, bleeding or throat pain from the TEE (Trans Esophageal Echo) probe, blood clot or air bubbles in the lungs or other organs, bruising at the catheter insertion site, clot formation on the WATCHMAN™ Closure Device, cranial bleed, excessive bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, groin puncture bleed, hypotension, infection/pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pulmonary vein obstruction, renal failure, stroke, thrombosis and transient ischemic attack. In rare cases death can occur.

Be sure to talk with your doctor so that you thoroughly understand all of the risks and benefits associated with the implantation of the WATCHMAN Device.

Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology.
Boston Scientific is primarily known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open clogged arteries.[3] With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD).[4][5]

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]


Companies portal


In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]
Profits rose to €887 million in 2015 in the Irish-based plant. In 2014 the profits were €766.65 million.[15] Profits increased by 13.57% in one year.

Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology.
Boston Scientific is primarily known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open clogged arteries.[3] With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD).[4][5]

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]


Companies portal


In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]
Profits rose to €887 million in 2015 in the Irish-based plant. In 2014 the profits were €766.65 million.[15] Profits increased by 13.57% in one year.

Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology.
Boston Scientific is primarily known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open clogged arteries.[3] With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD).[4][5]

History[edit]
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979 as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6]
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.[6]
The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]
On April 21, 2006, the company acquired longtime competitor Guidant for $27.2 billion. The former Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[7][8]
Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[9]
In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[10]


Companies portal


In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4]
In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
Johnson & Johnson lawsuits[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.[12]
It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[13]
Restatement[edit]
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[14]
Profits[edit]
Profits rose to €887 million in 2015 in the Irish-based plant. In 2014 the profits were €766.65 million.[15] Profits increased by 13.57% in one year.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
