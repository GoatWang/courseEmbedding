Richard H. Deily Promoted to Corporate Officer






January 06, 2015 08:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Argan, Inc. (NYSE: AGX) today announced that Richard H. Deily, 
      Argan’s Corporate Controller, is promoted to Vice President. Mr. Deily 
      has been Argan’s Corporate Controller since joining the Company in 
      October 2007.
    

      Mr. Bosselmann said that “Richard ‘Hank’ Deily has over thirty-five 
      years of senior financial management and audit experience with 
      publicly-traded companies. He began his career with nine years of 
      service at a major national public accounting firm. We anticipate that 
      he will continue to make significant contributions to the quality of 
      Argan’s financial reporting and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.”
    

About Argan, Inc.


      Argan’s primary business is designing and building energy plants through 
      its Gemma Power Systems subsidiary. These energy plants include 
      traditional gas as well as alternative energy including biodiesel, 
      ethanol, and renewable energy sources such as biomass, wind and solar. 
      Argan also owns Southern Maryland Cable, Inc.
    

Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities 
      laws and are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not 
      limited to: (1) the Company’s ability to achieve its business strategy 
      while effectively managing costs and expenses; (2) the Company’s ability 
      to successfully and profitably integrate acquisitions; and (3) the 
      continued strong performance of the energy sector. Actual results and 
      the timing of certain events could differ materially from those 
      projected in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a 
      number of factors detailed from time to time in Argan’s filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, reference is 
      hereby made to cautionary statements with respect to risk factors set 
      forth in the Company’s most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, and 
      other SEC filings.
