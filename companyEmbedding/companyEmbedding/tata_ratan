Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and Padma Bhushan in 2000, the second and third highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.[39]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and Padma Bhushan in 2000, the second and third highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.[39]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and Padma Bhushan in 2000, the second and third highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.[39]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Tata Group has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in India.[8][9] The Tata Group was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 for philanthropic activities.[10] Some of the institutes established by the Tata Group are:

The Energy and Resources Institute (formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute), a non-governmental research institute
The JRD Tata Ecotechnology Centre
National Centre for Performing Arts
Tata Center for Technology & Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology[11]
Tata Centre for Technology & Design at IIT Bombay[12]
Tata Cricket Academy
Tata Football Academy
Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Tata Management Training Centre
Tata Medical Center, inaugurated on 16 May 2011 by Ratan Tata[13]
Tata Memorial Hospital
Tata Trusts, a group of philanthropic organisations run by the head of the business conglomerate Tata Sons[14]


Tata Cancer Hospital

The Tata Group donated ₹ 2.20 billion ($50 million) to the Harvard Business School (HBS) to build an academic and a residential building on the institute's campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The new building is called the Tata Hall and is used for the institute's executive education programmes.[15] This amount is the largest given from an international donor to Harvard Business School.




Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Group[16]


One Tata project brought together Tata Group companies (TCS, Titan Industries and Tata Chemicals) in developing a compact, in-home water-purification device. It was called Tata swach, which means "clean" in Hindi, and would cost less than 1000 rupees (US$21). The idea of originated from the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which left thousands of people without clean drinking water. This device has filters that last about a year for a family of five. It is a low-cost product available for people who have no access to safe drinking water in their homes.[17] The advantage of this device is that it does not require the use of electricity.[18]
TCS also designed and donated an innovative software package that claims to teach illiterate adults how to read in 40 hours. "The children of the people who have been through our literacy program are all in school", said Pankaj Baliga, global head of corporate social responsibility for TCS.[17]
In 1912, Tata Group expanded their CEO's concept of community philanthropy to include the workplace. They instituted an eight-hour workday, before nearly any other company in the world. In 1917, they recommended a medical-services policy for Tata employees. The company was among the first worldwide to organise modern pension systems, workers' compensation, maternity benefits, and profit-sharing plans.[17]
The charitable trusts of Tata Group fund a variety of projects, for example, the Tata Swach and the TCS project. They founded and still support such cherished institutions as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Each Tata Group company channels more than 4 percent of its operating income to the trusts, and every generation of Tata family members has left a larger portion of its profit to them.[17]
After the Mumbai attacks, salaries of the attacked Taj Hotel employees were paid despite the hotel being closed for reconstruction. About 1600 employees were provided food, water, sanitation and first aid through employee outreach centres. Ratan Tata personally visited families of all the employees that were affected. The employees' relatives were flown to Mumbai from outside areas and were all accommodated for three weeks. Tata also covered compensation for railway employees, police staff, and pedestrians. The market vendors and shop owners were given care and assistance after the attacks. A psychiatric institution was established with the Tata Group of Social Science to counsel those who were affected and needed help. Tata also granted the education of 46 children of the victims of the terrorist attacks.[19][20]
In 2013, the Tata Group, through the Tata Relief Committee and the Himmotthan Society, an associate organisation of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, worked in close collaboration with the Uttarakhand government to provide relief to the impacted local communities in three districts of the state. The relief activities, which included provision of food and household material, covered over 65 villages and 3,000 families. In the first phase of relief, the group expected to reach over 100 villages. The Tata group also plans to implement long-term measures for the economic, ecological and resource sustainability of the affected communities and areas. The plan will be based on a baseline survey of impacted villages carried out by teams from the Centre for Disaster Management at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, in collaboration with local organisations and communities.[21][22]
In 2017, Tata Football Academy has won the bid to form a football club based on Jamshedpur of Jharkhand in the 4th edition of Indian Super League along with Bengaluru FC.
Controversies and criticisms[edit]
The Tata Group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms, including the following.
Munnar, Kerala[edit]
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that Tata Tea had 'grabbed' forest land of 3,000 acres (12 km2) at Munnar. The Tatas said they possessed 58,741.82 acres (237.7197 km2) of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that. The then Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party.
Kalinganagar, Odisha[edit]
On 2 January 2006, policemen at Kalinganagar, Odisha, opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers. The villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them, for a Tata steel plant. Some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition. When pushed for comment, TATA officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant.[23]
Supplies to Burma's military regime[edit]
Tata Motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists. In December 2006, Gen. Thura Shwe Mann, Myanmar's chief of general staff visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.[24] In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in Myanmar.[25][26]
Land acquisition in Singur[edit]
The Singur controversy[27] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with protests by locals and political parties (though the involvement of Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as an act for political gains) over the forced acquisition, eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant. As the protests grew, and despite having the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. The Singur controversy was one of the few occasions when Ratan Tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue. Ratan Tata subsequently embraced Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, who quickly made land available for the Nano project.[28]
In a historic judgement on Aug 31 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant, and directed the West Bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within 12 weeks.[29]
Dhamra Port, Odisha[edit]
On the environmental front, the Port of Dhamara controversy has received significant coverage, both within India and in Tata's emerging global markets.[30][31]
The Dhamra port, a venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has come in for criticism for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park, from Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace. Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle, and Bhitarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. TATA officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat, and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the IUCN.[32] On the other hand, conservation organisations, including Greenpeace, have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project, which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed, and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the Gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.[33][34] Dhamra port stake has been hived off.
Soda extraction plant in Tanzania[edit]
Tata group, along with a Tanzanian company, joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[35] Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers.[36]
It could also jeopardise the Lesser Flamingo birds there, which are already endangered. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce.[37] Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.[35] 22 African nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction.[35]
Data and intellectual property theft[edit]
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed Oct. 31, 2014, the charges accused Tata of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" and that the 6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra.[38][39][40]
Fire breakout at headquarters[edit]
On 16 June 2016, a fire broke out at the corporate headquarters of the company in Mumbai. However, due to quick containment, no casualties were reported. [41]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Tata Group has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in India.[8][9] The Tata Group was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 for philanthropic activities.[10] Some of the institutes established by the Tata Group are:

The Energy and Resources Institute (formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute), a non-governmental research institute
The JRD Tata Ecotechnology Centre
National Centre for Performing Arts
Tata Center for Technology & Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology[11]
Tata Centre for Technology & Design at IIT Bombay[12]
Tata Cricket Academy
Tata Football Academy
Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Tata Management Training Centre
Tata Medical Center, inaugurated on 16 May 2011 by Ratan Tata[13]
Tata Memorial Hospital
Tata Trusts, a group of philanthropic organisations run by the head of the business conglomerate Tata Sons[14]


Tata Cancer Hospital

The Tata Group donated ₹ 2.20 billion ($50 million) to the Harvard Business School (HBS) to build an academic and a residential building on the institute's campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The new building is called the Tata Hall and is used for the institute's executive education programmes.[15] This amount is the largest given from an international donor to Harvard Business School.




Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Group[16]


One Tata project brought together Tata Group companies (TCS, Titan Industries and Tata Chemicals) in developing a compact, in-home water-purification device. It was called Tata swach, which means "clean" in Hindi, and would cost less than 1000 rupees (US$21). The idea of originated from the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which left thousands of people without clean drinking water. This device has filters that last about a year for a family of five. It is a low-cost product available for people who have no access to safe drinking water in their homes.[17] The advantage of this device is that it does not require the use of electricity.[18]
TCS also designed and donated an innovative software package that claims to teach illiterate adults how to read in 40 hours. "The children of the people who have been through our literacy program are all in school", said Pankaj Baliga, global head of corporate social responsibility for TCS.[17]
In 1912, Tata Group expanded their CEO's concept of community philanthropy to include the workplace. They instituted an eight-hour workday, before nearly any other company in the world. In 1917, they recommended a medical-services policy for Tata employees. The company was among the first worldwide to organise modern pension systems, workers' compensation, maternity benefits, and profit-sharing plans.[17]
The charitable trusts of Tata Group fund a variety of projects, for example, the Tata Swach and the TCS project. They founded and still support such cherished institutions as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Each Tata Group company channels more than 4 percent of its operating income to the trusts, and every generation of Tata family members has left a larger portion of its profit to them.[17]
After the Mumbai attacks, salaries of the attacked Taj Hotel employees were paid despite the hotel being closed for reconstruction. About 1600 employees were provided food, water, sanitation and first aid through employee outreach centres. Ratan Tata personally visited families of all the employees that were affected. The employees' relatives were flown to Mumbai from outside areas and were all accommodated for three weeks. Tata also covered compensation for railway employees, police staff, and pedestrians. The market vendors and shop owners were given care and assistance after the attacks. A psychiatric institution was established with the Tata Group of Social Science to counsel those who were affected and needed help. Tata also granted the education of 46 children of the victims of the terrorist attacks.[19][20]
In 2013, the Tata Group, through the Tata Relief Committee and the Himmotthan Society, an associate organisation of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, worked in close collaboration with the Uttarakhand government to provide relief to the impacted local communities in three districts of the state. The relief activities, which included provision of food and household material, covered over 65 villages and 3,000 families. In the first phase of relief, the group expected to reach over 100 villages. The Tata group also plans to implement long-term measures for the economic, ecological and resource sustainability of the affected communities and areas. The plan will be based on a baseline survey of impacted villages carried out by teams from the Centre for Disaster Management at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, in collaboration with local organisations and communities.[21][22]
In 2017, Tata Football Academy has won the bid to form a football club based on Jamshedpur of Jharkhand in the 4th edition of Indian Super League along with Bengaluru FC.
Controversies and criticisms[edit]
The Tata Group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms, including the following.
Munnar, Kerala[edit]
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that Tata Tea had 'grabbed' forest land of 3,000 acres (12 km2) at Munnar. The Tatas said they possessed 58,741.82 acres (237.7197 km2) of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that. The then Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party.
Kalinganagar, Odisha[edit]
On 2 January 2006, policemen at Kalinganagar, Odisha, opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers. The villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them, for a Tata steel plant. Some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition. When pushed for comment, TATA officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant.[23]
Supplies to Burma's military regime[edit]
Tata Motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists. In December 2006, Gen. Thura Shwe Mann, Myanmar's chief of general staff visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.[24] In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in Myanmar.[25][26]
Land acquisition in Singur[edit]
The Singur controversy[27] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with protests by locals and political parties (though the involvement of Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as an act for political gains) over the forced acquisition, eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant. As the protests grew, and despite having the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. The Singur controversy was one of the few occasions when Ratan Tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue. Ratan Tata subsequently embraced Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, who quickly made land available for the Nano project.[28]
In a historic judgement on Aug 31 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant, and directed the West Bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within 12 weeks.[29]
Dhamra Port, Odisha[edit]
On the environmental front, the Port of Dhamara controversy has received significant coverage, both within India and in Tata's emerging global markets.[30][31]
The Dhamra port, a venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has come in for criticism for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park, from Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace. Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle, and Bhitarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. TATA officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat, and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the IUCN.[32] On the other hand, conservation organisations, including Greenpeace, have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project, which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed, and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the Gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.[33][34] Dhamra port stake has been hived off.
Soda extraction plant in Tanzania[edit]
Tata group, along with a Tanzanian company, joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[35] Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers.[36]
It could also jeopardise the Lesser Flamingo birds there, which are already endangered. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce.[37] Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.[35] 22 African nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction.[35]
Data and intellectual property theft[edit]
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed Oct. 31, 2014, the charges accused Tata of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" and that the 6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra.[38][39][40]
Fire breakout at headquarters[edit]
On 16 June 2016, a fire broke out at the corporate headquarters of the company in Mumbai. However, due to quick containment, no casualties were reported. [41]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Tata Group has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in India.[8][9] The Tata Group was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 for philanthropic activities.[10] Some of the institutes established by the Tata Group are:

The Energy and Resources Institute (formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute), a non-governmental research institute
The JRD Tata Ecotechnology Centre
National Centre for Performing Arts
Tata Center for Technology & Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology[11]
Tata Centre for Technology & Design at IIT Bombay[12]
Tata Cricket Academy
Tata Football Academy
Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Tata Management Training Centre
Tata Medical Center, inaugurated on 16 May 2011 by Ratan Tata[13]
Tata Memorial Hospital
Tata Trusts, a group of philanthropic organisations run by the head of the business conglomerate Tata Sons[14]


Tata Cancer Hospital

The Tata Group donated ₹ 2.20 billion ($50 million) to the Harvard Business School (HBS) to build an academic and a residential building on the institute's campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The new building is called the Tata Hall and is used for the institute's executive education programmes.[15] This amount is the largest given from an international donor to Harvard Business School.




Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Group[16]


One Tata project brought together Tata Group companies (TCS, Titan Industries and Tata Chemicals) in developing a compact, in-home water-purification device. It was called Tata swach, which means "clean" in Hindi, and would cost less than 1000 rupees (US$21). The idea of originated from the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which left thousands of people without clean drinking water. This device has filters that last about a year for a family of five. It is a low-cost product available for people who have no access to safe drinking water in their homes.[17] The advantage of this device is that it does not require the use of electricity.[18]
TCS also designed and donated an innovative software package that claims to teach illiterate adults how to read in 40 hours. "The children of the people who have been through our literacy program are all in school", said Pankaj Baliga, global head of corporate social responsibility for TCS.[17]
In 1912, Tata Group expanded their CEO's concept of community philanthropy to include the workplace. They instituted an eight-hour workday, before nearly any other company in the world. In 1917, they recommended a medical-services policy for Tata employees. The company was among the first worldwide to organise modern pension systems, workers' compensation, maternity benefits, and profit-sharing plans.[17]
The charitable trusts of Tata Group fund a variety of projects, for example, the Tata Swach and the TCS project. They founded and still support such cherished institutions as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Each Tata Group company channels more than 4 percent of its operating income to the trusts, and every generation of Tata family members has left a larger portion of its profit to them.[17]
After the Mumbai attacks, salaries of the attacked Taj Hotel employees were paid despite the hotel being closed for reconstruction. About 1600 employees were provided food, water, sanitation and first aid through employee outreach centres. Ratan Tata personally visited families of all the employees that were affected. The employees' relatives were flown to Mumbai from outside areas and were all accommodated for three weeks. Tata also covered compensation for railway employees, police staff, and pedestrians. The market vendors and shop owners were given care and assistance after the attacks. A psychiatric institution was established with the Tata Group of Social Science to counsel those who were affected and needed help. Tata also granted the education of 46 children of the victims of the terrorist attacks.[19][20]
In 2013, the Tata Group, through the Tata Relief Committee and the Himmotthan Society, an associate organisation of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, worked in close collaboration with the Uttarakhand government to provide relief to the impacted local communities in three districts of the state. The relief activities, which included provision of food and household material, covered over 65 villages and 3,000 families. In the first phase of relief, the group expected to reach over 100 villages. The Tata group also plans to implement long-term measures for the economic, ecological and resource sustainability of the affected communities and areas. The plan will be based on a baseline survey of impacted villages carried out by teams from the Centre for Disaster Management at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, in collaboration with local organisations and communities.[21][22]
In 2017, Tata Football Academy has won the bid to form a football club based on Jamshedpur of Jharkhand in the 4th edition of Indian Super League along with Bengaluru FC.
Controversies and criticisms[edit]
The Tata Group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms, including the following.
Munnar, Kerala[edit]
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that Tata Tea had 'grabbed' forest land of 3,000 acres (12 km2) at Munnar. The Tatas said they possessed 58,741.82 acres (237.7197 km2) of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that. The then Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party.
Kalinganagar, Odisha[edit]
On 2 January 2006, policemen at Kalinganagar, Odisha, opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers. The villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them, for a Tata steel plant. Some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition. When pushed for comment, TATA officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant.[23]
Supplies to Burma's military regime[edit]
Tata Motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists. In December 2006, Gen. Thura Shwe Mann, Myanmar's chief of general staff visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.[24] In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in Myanmar.[25][26]
Land acquisition in Singur[edit]
The Singur controversy[27] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with protests by locals and political parties (though the involvement of Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as an act for political gains) over the forced acquisition, eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant. As the protests grew, and despite having the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. The Singur controversy was one of the few occasions when Ratan Tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue. Ratan Tata subsequently embraced Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, who quickly made land available for the Nano project.[28]
In a historic judgement on Aug 31 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant, and directed the West Bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within 12 weeks.[29]
Dhamra Port, Odisha[edit]
On the environmental front, the Port of Dhamara controversy has received significant coverage, both within India and in Tata's emerging global markets.[30][31]
The Dhamra port, a venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has come in for criticism for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park, from Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace. Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle, and Bhitarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. TATA officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat, and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the IUCN.[32] On the other hand, conservation organisations, including Greenpeace, have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project, which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed, and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the Gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.[33][34] Dhamra port stake has been hived off.
Soda extraction plant in Tanzania[edit]
Tata group, along with a Tanzanian company, joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[35] Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers.[36]
It could also jeopardise the Lesser Flamingo birds there, which are already endangered. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce.[37] Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.[35] 22 African nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction.[35]
Data and intellectual property theft[edit]
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed Oct. 31, 2014, the charges accused Tata of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" and that the 6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra.[38][39][40]
Fire breakout at headquarters[edit]
On 16 June 2016, a fire broke out at the corporate headquarters of the company in Mumbai. However, due to quick containment, no casualties were reported. [41]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Tata Group has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in India.[8][9] The Tata Group was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 for philanthropic activities.[10] Some of the institutes established by the Tata Group are:

The Energy and Resources Institute (formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute), a non-governmental research institute
The JRD Tata Ecotechnology Centre
National Centre for Performing Arts
Tata Center for Technology & Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology[11]
Tata Centre for Technology & Design at IIT Bombay[12]
Tata Cricket Academy
Tata Football Academy
Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Tata Management Training Centre
Tata Medical Center, inaugurated on 16 May 2011 by Ratan Tata[13]
Tata Memorial Hospital
Tata Trusts, a group of philanthropic organisations run by the head of the business conglomerate Tata Sons[14]


Tata Cancer Hospital

The Tata Group donated ₹ 2.20 billion ($50 million) to the Harvard Business School (HBS) to build an academic and a residential building on the institute's campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The new building is called the Tata Hall and is used for the institute's executive education programmes.[15] This amount is the largest given from an international donor to Harvard Business School.




Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Group[16]


One Tata project brought together Tata Group companies (TCS, Titan Industries and Tata Chemicals) in developing a compact, in-home water-purification device. It was called Tata swach, which means "clean" in Hindi, and would cost less than 1000 rupees (US$21). The idea of originated from the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which left thousands of people without clean drinking water. This device has filters that last about a year for a family of five. It is a low-cost product available for people who have no access to safe drinking water in their homes.[17] The advantage of this device is that it does not require the use of electricity.[18]
TCS also designed and donated an innovative software package that claims to teach illiterate adults how to read in 40 hours. "The children of the people who have been through our literacy program are all in school", said Pankaj Baliga, global head of corporate social responsibility for TCS.[17]
In 1912, Tata Group expanded their CEO's concept of community philanthropy to include the workplace. They instituted an eight-hour workday, before nearly any other company in the world. In 1917, they recommended a medical-services policy for Tata employees. The company was among the first worldwide to organise modern pension systems, workers' compensation, maternity benefits, and profit-sharing plans.[17]
The charitable trusts of Tata Group fund a variety of projects, for example, the Tata Swach and the TCS project. They founded and still support such cherished institutions as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Each Tata Group company channels more than 4 percent of its operating income to the trusts, and every generation of Tata family members has left a larger portion of its profit to them.[17]
After the Mumbai attacks, salaries of the attacked Taj Hotel employees were paid despite the hotel being closed for reconstruction. About 1600 employees were provided food, water, sanitation and first aid through employee outreach centres. Ratan Tata personally visited families of all the employees that were affected. The employees' relatives were flown to Mumbai from outside areas and were all accommodated for three weeks. Tata also covered compensation for railway employees, police staff, and pedestrians. The market vendors and shop owners were given care and assistance after the attacks. A psychiatric institution was established with the Tata Group of Social Science to counsel those who were affected and needed help. Tata also granted the education of 46 children of the victims of the terrorist attacks.[19][20]
In 2013, the Tata Group, through the Tata Relief Committee and the Himmotthan Society, an associate organisation of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, worked in close collaboration with the Uttarakhand government to provide relief to the impacted local communities in three districts of the state. The relief activities, which included provision of food and household material, covered over 65 villages and 3,000 families. In the first phase of relief, the group expected to reach over 100 villages. The Tata group also plans to implement long-term measures for the economic, ecological and resource sustainability of the affected communities and areas. The plan will be based on a baseline survey of impacted villages carried out by teams from the Centre for Disaster Management at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, in collaboration with local organisations and communities.[21][22]
In 2017, Tata Football Academy has won the bid to form a football club based on Jamshedpur of Jharkhand in the 4th edition of Indian Super League along with Bengaluru FC.
Controversies and criticisms[edit]
The Tata Group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms, including the following.
Munnar, Kerala[edit]
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that Tata Tea had 'grabbed' forest land of 3,000 acres (12 km2) at Munnar. The Tatas said they possessed 58,741.82 acres (237.7197 km2) of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that. The then Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party.
Kalinganagar, Odisha[edit]
On 2 January 2006, policemen at Kalinganagar, Odisha, opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers. The villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them, for a Tata steel plant. Some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition. When pushed for comment, TATA officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant.[23]
Supplies to Burma's military regime[edit]
Tata Motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists. In December 2006, Gen. Thura Shwe Mann, Myanmar's chief of general staff visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.[24] In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in Myanmar.[25][26]
Land acquisition in Singur[edit]
The Singur controversy[27] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with protests by locals and political parties (though the involvement of Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as an act for political gains) over the forced acquisition, eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant. As the protests grew, and despite having the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. The Singur controversy was one of the few occasions when Ratan Tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue. Ratan Tata subsequently embraced Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, who quickly made land available for the Nano project.[28]
In a historic judgement on Aug 31 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant, and directed the West Bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within 12 weeks.[29]
Dhamra Port, Odisha[edit]
On the environmental front, the Port of Dhamara controversy has received significant coverage, both within India and in Tata's emerging global markets.[30][31]
The Dhamra port, a venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has come in for criticism for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park, from Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace. Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle, and Bhitarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. TATA officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat, and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the IUCN.[32] On the other hand, conservation organisations, including Greenpeace, have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project, which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed, and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the Gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.[33][34] Dhamra port stake has been hived off.
Soda extraction plant in Tanzania[edit]
Tata group, along with a Tanzanian company, joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[35] Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers.[36]
It could also jeopardise the Lesser Flamingo birds there, which are already endangered. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce.[37] Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.[35] 22 African nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction.[35]
Data and intellectual property theft[edit]
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed Oct. 31, 2014, the charges accused Tata of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" and that the 6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra.[38][39][40]
Fire breakout at headquarters[edit]
On 16 June 2016, a fire broke out at the corporate headquarters of the company in Mumbai. However, due to quick containment, no casualties were reported. [41]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Tata Group has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in India.[8][9] The Tata Group was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 for philanthropic activities.[10] Some of the institutes established by the Tata Group are:

The Energy and Resources Institute (formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute), a non-governmental research institute
The JRD Tata Ecotechnology Centre
National Centre for Performing Arts
Tata Center for Technology & Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology[11]
Tata Centre for Technology & Design at IIT Bombay[12]
Tata Cricket Academy
Tata Football Academy
Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Tata Management Training Centre
Tata Medical Center, inaugurated on 16 May 2011 by Ratan Tata[13]
Tata Memorial Hospital
Tata Trusts, a group of philanthropic organisations run by the head of the business conglomerate Tata Sons[14]


Tata Cancer Hospital

The Tata Group donated ₹ 2.20 billion ($50 million) to the Harvard Business School (HBS) to build an academic and a residential building on the institute's campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The new building is called the Tata Hall and is used for the institute's executive education programmes.[15] This amount is the largest given from an international donor to Harvard Business School.




Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Group[16]


One Tata project brought together Tata Group companies (TCS, Titan Industries and Tata Chemicals) in developing a compact, in-home water-purification device. It was called Tata swach, which means "clean" in Hindi, and would cost less than 1000 rupees (US$21). The idea of originated from the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which left thousands of people without clean drinking water. This device has filters that last about a year for a family of five. It is a low-cost product available for people who have no access to safe drinking water in their homes.[17] The advantage of this device is that it does not require the use of electricity.[18]
TCS also designed and donated an innovative software package that claims to teach illiterate adults how to read in 40 hours. "The children of the people who have been through our literacy program are all in school", said Pankaj Baliga, global head of corporate social responsibility for TCS.[17]
In 1912, Tata Group expanded their CEO's concept of community philanthropy to include the workplace. They instituted an eight-hour workday, before nearly any other company in the world. In 1917, they recommended a medical-services policy for Tata employees. The company was among the first worldwide to organise modern pension systems, workers' compensation, maternity benefits, and profit-sharing plans.[17]
The charitable trusts of Tata Group fund a variety of projects, for example, the Tata Swach and the TCS project. They founded and still support such cherished institutions as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Each Tata Group company channels more than 4 percent of its operating income to the trusts, and every generation of Tata family members has left a larger portion of its profit to them.[17]
After the Mumbai attacks, salaries of the attacked Taj Hotel employees were paid despite the hotel being closed for reconstruction. About 1600 employees were provided food, water, sanitation and first aid through employee outreach centres. Ratan Tata personally visited families of all the employees that were affected. The employees' relatives were flown to Mumbai from outside areas and were all accommodated for three weeks. Tata also covered compensation for railway employees, police staff, and pedestrians. The market vendors and shop owners were given care and assistance after the attacks. A psychiatric institution was established with the Tata Group of Social Science to counsel those who were affected and needed help. Tata also granted the education of 46 children of the victims of the terrorist attacks.[19][20]
In 2013, the Tata Group, through the Tata Relief Committee and the Himmotthan Society, an associate organisation of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, worked in close collaboration with the Uttarakhand government to provide relief to the impacted local communities in three districts of the state. The relief activities, which included provision of food and household material, covered over 65 villages and 3,000 families. In the first phase of relief, the group expected to reach over 100 villages. The Tata group also plans to implement long-term measures for the economic, ecological and resource sustainability of the affected communities and areas. The plan will be based on a baseline survey of impacted villages carried out by teams from the Centre for Disaster Management at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, in collaboration with local organisations and communities.[21][22]
In 2017, Tata Football Academy has won the bid to form a football club based on Jamshedpur of Jharkhand in the 4th edition of Indian Super League along with Bengaluru FC.
Controversies and criticisms[edit]
The Tata Group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms, including the following.
Munnar, Kerala[edit]
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that Tata Tea had 'grabbed' forest land of 3,000 acres (12 km2) at Munnar. The Tatas said they possessed 58,741.82 acres (237.7197 km2) of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that. The then Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party.
Kalinganagar, Odisha[edit]
On 2 January 2006, policemen at Kalinganagar, Odisha, opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers. The villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them, for a Tata steel plant. Some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition. When pushed for comment, TATA officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant.[23]
Supplies to Burma's military regime[edit]
Tata Motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists. In December 2006, Gen. Thura Shwe Mann, Myanmar's chief of general staff visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.[24] In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in Myanmar.[25][26]
Land acquisition in Singur[edit]
The Singur controversy[27] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with protests by locals and political parties (though the involvement of Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as an act for political gains) over the forced acquisition, eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant. As the protests grew, and despite having the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. The Singur controversy was one of the few occasions when Ratan Tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue. Ratan Tata subsequently embraced Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, who quickly made land available for the Nano project.[28]
In a historic judgement on Aug 31 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant, and directed the West Bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within 12 weeks.[29]
Dhamra Port, Odisha[edit]
On the environmental front, the Port of Dhamara controversy has received significant coverage, both within India and in Tata's emerging global markets.[30][31]
The Dhamra port, a venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has come in for criticism for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park, from Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace. Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle, and Bhitarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. TATA officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat, and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the IUCN.[32] On the other hand, conservation organisations, including Greenpeace, have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project, which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed, and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the Gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.[33][34] Dhamra port stake has been hived off.
Soda extraction plant in Tanzania[edit]
Tata group, along with a Tanzanian company, joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[35] Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers.[36]
It could also jeopardise the Lesser Flamingo birds there, which are already endangered. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce.[37] Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.[35] 22 African nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction.[35]
Data and intellectual property theft[edit]
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed Oct. 31, 2014, the charges accused Tata of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" and that the 6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra.[38][39][40]
Fire breakout at headquarters[edit]
On 16 June 2016, a fire broke out at the corporate headquarters of the company in Mumbai. However, due to quick containment, no casualties were reported. [41]

SINGAPORE: The Tata group may consider launching its small car Nano in a new avatar in another country like Indonesia, where it doesn't have the 'stigma' of being 'the cheapest car', and bring it back to India for a fresh start with a new image, according to chairman emeritus Ratan Tata.  Tata, who stepped down as the chairman of the salt-to-software conglomerate last December, said Nano could also be marketed as a changed product in Europe to tap interest on the car outside India.  "Maybe it (Nano) gets launched in another country like Indonesia, where it doesn't have the stigma and the new image comes back to India. Or maybe as a changed product that gets marketed in Europe. There's a lot of interest in Nano outside India," Tata said in an interview on CNBC's Managing Asia.  Stating that Tatas are working on a refreshed Nano, he added: "A re-launched Nano with some of the differences that we're trying to incorporate, yes I do...We are going to relaunch the car not as the cheapest car but in the image as it is."  Admitting that Tata Motors made a mistake in the marketing and positioning of the Nano, he said: "It became termed as a cheapest car by the public and, I am sorry to say, by ourselves, not by me, but the company when it was marketing it. I think that is unfortunate."  He further said: "I always felt that Nano should have been marketed towards the owner of a two-wheeler because it was conceived giving the people who rode on two-wheels with the whole family an all-weather safe form of affordable transportation, not the cheapest."  In an interview last year, Tata had said that the Nano was being 'refreshed' to realise its full potential,  The Nano has failed to live up to the expectations after being hyped as the cheapest car to hit the roads. It sales have been dwindling despite the company's attempts to reposition it. In the April-October period this fiscal, it clocked just 12,322 units as against 43,627 units in the year-ago period, down 71.7 per cent.  In October this year, Tata Motors launched a new version of the Nano with CNG and petrol bi-fuel system options.  The Nano has a troubled past. It was originally planned to roll out from a plant in Singur, West Bengal, but the plant had to be shifted to Sanand in Gujarat after political protests at its earlier plant. Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either.  The car was launched in March 2009 with an initial ex-factory price tag of close to Rs one lakh for the basic model. It is currently available between Rs 1.45 lakh and Rs 2.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) across all variants.  RELATEDFrom around the webMore from The Times of IndiaRecommended By Colombia

Product Overview

Suitable for MBA, EMBA, and executive education programs, this case uses Tata Motors' move to acquire Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) from Ford to analyze a growth-through-acquisition strategy. It offers a discussion about the firm's overall strategy to acquire instead of growing organically. The case begins when Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors, unveils the world's cheapest car?the Nano. He had challenged the people around him to design and produce something that had previously been unthinkable. Their ability to deliver on such a bold aspiration provided the confidence Tata Motors needed to compete in the international automobile market. Ratan believed he would have to establish a firm foothold in the United States and the United Kingdom to be considered a global contender. His strategy was to become a runner in the bid to acquire JLR from Ford. Establishing a luxury brand would go a long way toward separating Tata Motors from regional automotive firms. Yet Ratan had to think about whether the firm was well positioned to execute the acquisition if it won the bid. Or was organic growth a safer route to the same end?
Learning Objectives
•Examine growth strategies •Consider implementation issues •Analyze core capabilities, positioning, target customers, and new markets •Learn to assess a firm’s strategy involving considerations and constraints that originate both inside and outside the firm

Abstract:

 The Tata Group, one of India's largest business conglomerates, was established by Jamshedji Tata in the second half of the 19th century. Jamshedji's vision for the group was in line with nationalist goals and ideals then, and was envisaged to make India self-reliant. After Jamshedji, Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata (JRD) became the Chairman of the Tata Group and played a significant role in continuing the vision of the Group. Tata's assets climbed from INR620 million in 1939 to INR100 billion in 1990. Tata Motors had increased its sales to INR1 million in the year 1991 and it had rolled out 3 million vehicles in the same year. In 1991, Ratan Naval Tata took over the Chairmanship from JRD Tata. Although he was initially criticised for his poor performance, over the years, Ratan Tata disproved his critics. He restructured Tata Group's business operations and made the group compete globally. Under Ratan Tata's chairmanship, Tata Consultancy Services went public and Tata Motors was listed in the New York Stock Exchange. Starting from the late 1990s, Ratan revamped the operations of Tata Steel and made it one of the lowest cost steel producers in the world. However, as the Tatas lack an heir who can succeed Ratan, the group is at a crossroads to decide who will be the next chairman. After Ratan Tata's retirement, the dilemma is who will succeed him and carry the vision of the group. The teaching objectives are: (1) to understand the vision that had driven the Tata group till Ratan Tata joined; (2) to analyse the contribution made by Ratan Tata to the Tata Group; (3) to analyse if conglomerates can be driven by leaders' vision and not necessarily by a strategy; (4) to analyse the leadership style of Ratan Tata; (5) to analyse the succession dilemma at the Tata Group; and (6) to analyse what kind of leadership is required for Tata Group after Ratan Tata steps down.

Echoing Tata Sons’ ousted Chairman Cyrus P. Mistry, Tata Motors on Friday said its Nano small car has been “a loss-making product” in the highly price-sensitive market, coupled with low volumes.Mistry had earlier stated that “as there is no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy for the company requires to shut it down”.“Considering the attention and excitement it created, project investments were set up for capacities for around 2,50,000 cars per annum. However, unfortunately, and due to combination of several factors, including project delays due to change in location of the factory, and the perception of being a ‘low priced’ car, the volumes initially anticipated did not materialise and utilisation of capacities are significantly lower,” said the car maker responding to clarifications sought by BSE.In a highly price-sensitive segment of the market, coupled with low volumes, it has been a loss making product, it added.Mistry had also alleged that the Nano product development concept called “for a car below Rs 1 lakh, but the costs were always above this”. “This product has consistently lost money, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore,” he said.The company further said that a major part of the investments in the factory are “capable of being utilised for other products” as is “evident from the production of company’s Tiago cars” in the same factory.“As far as development cost and investments in Nano specific dies and toolings are concerned, these have significantly written off, in line with the accounting policies, over the last several years,” the filing said.Mistry had also pointed out that challenge in shutting down Nano is that it would “stop the supply of the Nano gliders to an entity that makes electric cars and in which Mr. Tata has stake”.Responding to that, the company said, “We would like to clarify that the matter is in a preliminary exploratory stage and no arrangement for supply of gliders has been conducted.”The car maker said that it got approval of the board for its future passenger vehicle product and business strategy, which envisages refocusing its strategy on growing and attractive segments of the passenger vehicle market in terms of volumes and profitability, and “aligning with the changing and enhanced expectations of the consumers regarding contents and features”.The company also said that it would pursue the refocused long-term strategy.

Shivachandra M S Bhat, Proud owner of Tata ProductsAnswered 62w agoTata Salt - Desh Ki NamakA pioneer in the Indian salt market, Tata Salt was launched in 1983 as the country's first branded iodised salt. In a market that was characterised by loose, unbranded salt of dubious quality, Tata Salt provided Indian consumers a hygienic, standardised product that came with the guarantee of one of India's most trusted business houses — the Tatas.Over the last two decades, Tata Salt has lived up to its claim of being 'Desh Ka Namak'. According to Nielsen Retail Audit, March 2011, each month more than 50,000 metric tonnes of Tata Salt is sold through over 12 lakh retail outlets reaching 50 million households across the country. The brand has managed to achieve these robust figures by consistently delivering health-aware products. The key to the brand's success lies in the superior product quality of Tata Salt.Tata Salt is manufactured using vacuum evaporation technology, which makes it hygienic and free from impurities. Also it has the requisite and consistent amount of iodine and saltiness, thus making any recipe that much tastier.Today, Tata Salt is the market leader, commanding a share of over 62 per cent of the national branded salt category. It has also consistently been named one of India's most trusted food brands since 2003 by The Economic Times Brand Equity 'Most Trusted Brands' survey conducted by AC Nielsen each year. While competitors have come and gone, innovative brand building over the years has helped build and maintain the trust consumers have placed in Tata Salt. The initial 'Namak ho Tata ka — Tata Namak' and path breaking 'Desh ka Namak' and most recent 'Gulmil ke' ad campaigns creatively tapped into this emotional connect, reinforcing Tata Salt's leadership position in the marketplace as well as in the consumer's mind.As the brand continues to grow, an important aspect is identifying future market needs and innovatively addressing them. In this effort Tata Salt has launched a bouquet of products designed to cater to specific segments of consumers, offering them a choice of products that come with the trust of Tata Salt. Tata Salt Lite (low-sodium salt), Tata Salt Plus (iron-fortified salt) and Sprinklers have been launched in recent years further assaying the brand's commitment to its customers.Source:Tata Salt: Desh Ka Namak651 Views · 7 Upvotes · Answer requested by  Aravind Srinivasan  Paritosh Gupta, Analytics Evangelist | EveryDay Motivator | AI practitionerAnswered 62w agoYes, Tata Salt is the product of Tata.

The Tata group
Out of India
Under Ratan Tata, the business group that bears his name has transformed itself from an Indian giant into a global powerhouse

RATAN TATA is as different as can be from the popular image of a business titan: he is a natural gentleman who lives austerely, litters his conversation with references to “dignity” and “duty” and is happiest when talking about his pet dogs, two German shepherds. He owns less than 1% of the group that bears his family name. But he is a titan nonetheless: the most powerful businessman in India and one of the most influential in the world.
The Tata group, of which he is chairman, is a giant too—or rather a collection of them. This family of companies covers cars and consulting, software and steel, tea and coffee, chemicals and hotels. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is Asia's largest software company. Tata Steel is India's largest steelmaker and number ten in the world. Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces is India's biggest luxury hotel group by far. Tata Power is the country's largest private electricity company. Tata Global Beverages is the world's second-largest maker of branded tea. Overall, the group earned 3.2 trillion rupees, or $67.4 billion, in revenues in 2009-10 (see chart) and 82 billion rupees in profits.

Mr Tata has transformed the group. When he became chairman in 1991, India was groaning under the Licence Raj and Tata seldom ventured outside its home market. Today, as he prepares to step down in late 2012 and the search for a successor speeds up, India is one of the world's most dynamic economies and Tata operates in over 80 countries. The latest sign of its ambition came this week at the Geneva motor show, where Tata Motors showed a prototype of a small car for European drivers.
But the Tata story is about more than its own transformation. Just as Tata played a leading role in nation-building from its foundation in 1868, creating India's first Indian-owned steel plant, power station, luxury hotel, domestic airline and sundry other firsts, it is now one of the stars of India's globalisation. The group has also projected a new type of company onto the global stage—more diversified than Western firms, more engaged in the life of the community and, if its employees are to be believed, better equipped to prosper in both developed and developing markets.
The house that Ratan built
Mr Tata's enthronement in Bombay House, the group's headquarters, took place just before the liberalisation of India's economy, an event that Indian business people habitually call the country's “second independence”. He spotted that liberalisation was both an opportunity and a threat. It was an opportunity because it set Tata free: the economy had been so tightly regulated that you could be fined or even imprisoned for exceeding your output quotas. It was a threat because Tata was vulnerable. Its companies were unco-ordinated, overmanned and undermanaged. They had competed with each other so vigorously that four textile mills drove each other out of business, yet there was a serious risk that leaner, fitter foreigners would wipe out the lot.
Mr Tata set about streamlining with a vengeance. He focused the group on six industries that have provided most of its revenues since 2000—steel, motor vehicles, power, telecoms, information technology (IT) and hotels—and increased its often paltry shareholding in these core businesses. He gradually established Bombay House's power over the barons who had ruled the various businesses for decades. Companies now have to earn the right to use the Tata brand. The Tata Management Training Centre does as its name says; and TAS selects high-flyers who move regularly from one company to another as their careers develop. Teams of “auditors”, stars from across the group, conduct annual surveys of selected companies, reporting on progress and suggesting lessons to learn. 
The group embraced globalisation. The pace of foreign acquisitions has grown dramatically: in 1995-2003 Tata companies made, on average, one purchase a year; in 2004 they made six; and in 2005-06 more than 20. So has the scale. Tata Tea's takeover of Tetley Group, a British company, for $450m in 2000 was the first of several bold buys of well-known brands that announced the group's arrival in the global big league. In 2007 Tata Steel bought Corus, Europe's second-largest steelmaker, for $12.1 billion. A year later Tata Motors paid $2.3 billion for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). 
In all Tata has spent around $20 billion on foreign companies. Today it earns about three-fifths of its revenue abroad and employs more British workers than any other manufacturer, and two of its biggest companies, Tata Motors and Tata Communications, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Tata has been busy in emerging markets, too. Tata Steel and Tata Motors have been snapping up Asian companies, such as Thailand's Millennium Steel and South Korea's Daewoo trucks. At home Tata Motors makes the first Indian-designed car, the Indica, and the world's cheapest, the Nano. Mr Tata talks about the company's duty to produce groundbreaking products for the world's poor with missionary zeal.
The changes have been dramatic. A group that used to be identified with secure employment (“for shoes there's Bata and for jobs there's Tata”) has become obsessed by serving its customers and matching international standards. Tata Steel has more than doubled its output since 1994 (from 3m tonnes to 6.4m) while cutting its workforce in India by more than half (from 78,000 to 30,000). A jaunty self-confidence has replaced the self-doubt of the early 1990s. Yet Mr Tata's changes have gone only so far. That is partly because of caution and reverence for tradition, but also because there is logic behind the group's diversity. 
E pluribus plura
In Jamshedpur men in thick denim shirts and hard hats watch as molten steel is poured from a gigantic ladle. In Mumbai young women in exquisite saris add to the allure of the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel. In Pune PhDs from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and various Indian Institutes of Technology feed data into one of the world's most powerful privately owned supercomputers. They are all part of Tata's global workforce of about 395,000 people.
For all the frantic restructuring the group remains strikingly diversified by Western standards: 98 operating companies, 28 of them listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, in a bewildering range of industries. It is bound together by complicated interlocking structures: various central bodies, such as the Tata trusts and Tata Sons, hold shares in the companies.
Tata is also held together by a common culture that has been marinating for 140 years. Employees love to tell tales of how Tata got the better of the British overlords. They also love to point out that Tata created many of India's greatest institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the Tata Memorial Hospital. Reverence for Jamsetji Tata, the group's founder, borders on ancestor worship: his ever-present busts are garlanded with fresh flowers daily. On March 3rd thousands marched through the streets of Jamshedpur, as they do every year, to celebrate his birthday.
Tata prides itself above all on its culture, which it argues is defined by three things: loyalty, dignity and what is now called corporate social responsibility (CSR). It is not unusual to find a Tata lifer whose spouse works for the firm and whose father also did. Tata is admirably restrained by the flashy—it is tempting to say money-grubbing—standards of modern India. It has always eschewed “sinful” industries such as drink, tobacco and gambling. It is as committed to public service as it was when Jamsetji Tata was laying the economic foundations of Indian independence. 
Tata charitable trusts own two-thirds of the holding company, Tata Sons. Alan Rosling, a former Tata executive who spearheaded the group's globalisation, liked to say, “We're making money so that our shareholders can give it away.” The trusts funded worthy causes, from clean-water projects and literacy programmes to the various Tata institutions, to the tune of $97m in 2010. But the commitment to CSR is deeper than this.
Consider Jamshedpur, the home of Tata Steel and perhaps the world's most successful company town. Tata Steel runs almost all the city's institutions: these include a 980-bed hospital, a zoo, a giant sports stadium, academies for football, archery and athletics, golf courses and the local utility company. (“They provide you with a house and a car,” jokes Prabhat Sharma, head of corporate affairs for Tata Steel. “The only thing you need to bring is a wife.”) The company also employs 250 people to work with local tribespeople, to improve agriculture, health care and education, and regularly sends a hospital train farther into the hinterland. The city is remarkably well run by Indian standards, with broad avenues, green parks, reliable power and water that you can drink. Tata Steel gently mocks all this corporate philanthropy with the slogan, “We also make steel”.
This largesse has come under some strain in recent years. Tata Steel has reined back some activities (it no longer makes ice or shoes) and created a separate utility company. Tata Tea (now Tata Global Beverages) has sold its vast plantation in the Western Ghat mountains where it was the biggest employer for more than a century. But rationalisation has not gone far by Western standards. The tea plantations were sold to former employees. Tata Steel gave generous pensions to the thousands of workers it got rid of. 
The group has inevitably provoked criticism as it has stridden onto the international stage. Western investors who already apply a discount to American and European conglomerates are leery of India's more sprawling variety. Many Indians may view the prominence of Ambanis, Birlas and Tatas as part of the natural order of things. But Westerners tend to associate it with unreconstructed tradition and messy family politics. 
The widespread suspicion that Tata had overpaid for Corus and JLR seemed to be confirmed when the world's stockmarkets tumbled in 2007-08. Even Mr Tata admits that the group had to reach deep into its pockets to keep some subsidiaries going. But the crisis has done nothing to damage Tata's growing self-confidence. The global deals are beginning to repay its patience: JLR is likely to make $1 billion in profit this year as well as providing Tata Motors with valuable skills. Mr Tata warns the group against drawing the wrong conclusion from the meltdown: it needs to be more bullish rather than more conservative.
The sense behind the sprawl
Tata executives also insist that the group's sprawl makes sense, even if they sometimes explain it in idiosyncratic terms. R. Gopalakrishnan, a director of Tata Sons, explains the structure with reference to the extended Indian family: the patriarch sets an example to his “sons” and kicks them out of the house if they fail to live up to his values. But they also claim support from management thinkers such as Tarun Khanna, of Harvard Business School, and Jim Collins, the author of “Good to Great”.
Mr Khanna points out that diversified groups are the “dominant” form of business in many emerging markets, including Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan and Thailand. He argues that this makes eminent sense in countries with weak governments and underdeveloped institutions. India regularly comes in the bottom half of the World Bank's “Doing Business” rankings. Many institutions that Western companies take for granted are missing.
The group's spread not only improves its chances of grappling with bureaucracy and filling various institutional voids but also helps it wage two of the hottest wars in modern India: for talent and trust. Tata can compete with Western talent-magnets such as General Electric and Accenture. It is well enough known to appeal to people in the remotest villages. In last year's BrandFinance Global 500, a ranking of the world's most valuable brands, the Tata name was reckoned to be worth $11.2 billion, placing it first in India and 65th overall. Even the twin strategy of advancing at both the bottom and the top of the market makes sense: it is hard to dismiss Tata as a “cheap” brand when the group owns luxury hotels and fancy consultancies.
Mr Collins argues that “culture” is a rich corporate resource: many of the “great” Western companies that he studies share a propensity for ancestor worship. Tata's culture of probity has helped to insulate it from India's endemic corruption. It has guided its behaviour when standards have slipped: when the company discovered widespread irregularities in Tata Finance in 2001-02 it blew the whistle on itself. Tata has not escaped unharmed from the snowballing scandal over the Department of Telecommunications' decision, in 2008, to allocate wireless spectrum to favoured companies at below market prices. But in general its reputation has earned its senior figures the benefit of the doubt.
Tata's diversified structure has given it a valuable mixture of flexibility and deep pockets. Its companies have been able to seize opportunities, such as Tata Steel's takeover of Millennium Steel or Tata Motors' joint venture with Marcopolo, a Brazilian bus manufacturer. Bombay House provides Tata companies with clout when they want to make ambitious acquisitions (Tetley was twice the size of Tata Tea) or when the market turns against them. 
Tata's new frontiers
A profile in Fortune in 2002 characterised Tata as both “one of India's most beloved companies” and “a mess”. The latter no longer looks correct. But Tata will be held to much higher standards as it competes with the world's best. Its future success will depend on the answers to two questions. Can it use its muscle to become a master of innovation? And can it become a truly global company rather than just an Indian one that does well abroad?
Mr Tata's mission in his final years as chairman has been to foster innovation. He has started an annual competition with a prize for the best failed idea (failure is a “gold mine” for a great company, he says). He has also created five “clusters” (plastics and composites, nanotechnology, engineering, IT and water) that throw people from different businesses together. 
The group is pursuing innovation on two levels. At the high end, Tata Chemicals is conducting research in nanotechnology and food science, and TCS holds regular innovation conferences in Silicon Valley. But what has caught more attention is the group's commitment to “frugal innovation”: new products designed to appeal to poor people and the rising middle class. 
Tata's best-known frugal product, the Tata Nano, a 150,000 rupee car, has run into problems: some cars have suffered from what Ravi Kant, the vice-chairman of Tata Motors, calls “thermal incidents” and his customers call “catching fire”. Distribution has been poor, although more are appearing on the roads. Carl-Peter Forster, chief executive of Tata Motors, admitted this week in Geneva that the Nano business model is having to be reinvented.
Even if the Nano proves disappointing, frugal innovation looks promising overall. Tata Motors is making small trucks that are replacing three-wheelers. TCS has co-produced a cheap water filter, the Swach, using ingredients such as rice husks. Tata Steel has made a prototype of a $500 house that can be bought in a shop. The hotel company is building $20-a-night billets for India's army of commercial travellers.
The group is learning to combine the strengths of its various parts. Three companies collaborated on the Swach. After the Asian tsunami in December 2004 TCS and Tata Teleservices joined forces to develop a weather-alert system for fishermen. The group is also marrying high- and low-end innovation. The supercomputer in Pune was built in six weeks for around $30m. TCS has created a cheap software package that can teach adults to read in 40 hours. 
The Nano needs sprucing up
In globalising, Tata has been a fast learner, absorbing lessons from JLR and Daewoo. It has become more ambitious: Tata Global Beverages presents itself as a global company rather than an agglomeration of acquisitions. Tata also claims that it is easier for Indian companies to compete in Western markets than it is for Western ones to adapt to the complicated demands of developing markets. 
But the group nevertheless faces serious problems. One is the parochialism that afflicts big countries (and companies): the upper management is still dominated by Indians who know only life within Tata. A second is hubris. Tata is too inclined to celebrate the great pruning of the 1990s rather than ask whether another is due. It may not be able to justify today's degree of diversification when the Indian market is growing so rapidly and when it is doing so much business in the developed world. It needs to consider whether it is time to lop off weaker limbs such as Tata Teleservices, an also-ran in India's crowded telecoms market, and Tata Financial Services. 
The most immediate task, though, is more humdrum: replacing Ratan Tata. This will not be easy. Mr Tata has driven the group's big transformations from its restructuring to its focus on frugal innovation. His personality pervades the organisation, which is in a far better state than it was when he inherited it.
Tata has plenty of senior executives who have grown up under his regime—not least Noel Tata, Ratan's half-brother and the son-in-law of Pallonji Mistry, Tata Sons' largest individual shareholder. It has also forged a long-term strategy that could power its growth for years: producing a stream of innovative products that will both cater for the rising masses of the emerging world and shake up markets in richer places.

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]
Honours and awards[edit]
Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and Padma Bhushan in 2000, the second and third highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.[39]

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]
Board memberships and affiliations[edit]
He is the interim chairman of Tata Sons. He continues to head the main two Tata trusts Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust and their allied trusts, with a combined stake of 66% in Tata Sons, Tata group's holding company.
He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.
He is a director on the boards of Alcoa Inc., Mondelez International[34] and Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of University of Southern California, Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors, X Prize[35] and Cornell University.
He is a member on the board of International Advisory Council at Bocconi University[36]
He is also a member of the Harvard Business School India Advisory Board (IAB) since 2006 and previously a member of the Harvard Business School Asia-Pacific Advisory Board (APAB) 2001-2006.
In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months. The selection committee comprising Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya, are on the board of Tata Sons.[38]

Published on Aug 2, 2011This documentary features Cornell College of Architecture graduate Ratan Tata '59, BArch '62, chairman of Tata Sons, India's premier conglomerate.Created in honor of Tata's 50th Reunion in June 2009, this memory piece tells the story of Tata's years on the hill from 1955-1962 using vintage photos along with interviews of 22 other Cornellians, mostly fraternity brothers and architecture classmates.The video concentrates on the influence Cornell had on Tata while he was a student. He describes his early days on campus and why he selected Cornell and architecture. He and the others interviewed recall experiences from his undergraduate years in the fraternity, downtown apartment living, handling the Ithaca weather, the challenges of being a foreign student, flying in the single-engine Tri-Pacer, as well as the care he took of his black Mercedes. There is also a section with interviews of fellow Cornell Trustees and the Cornell President which explores the tremendous influence Ratan Tata has on present-day Cornell.Produced by Phil ('62, B.Arch. '64) and Maddy ('65) Handler, Fly on the Wall Productions.

Early life[edit]
Main article: Tata family
Ratan Tata is the son of Naval Tata, who had been adopted from J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage by Navajbai Tata. His parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when he was ten and his younger brother, Jimmy, was seven years old. Both he and his brother were raised by their grandmother Navajbai Tata.[6] He has a half-brother Noel Tata from Naval Tata's second marriage to Simone Tata.
He schooled in Mumbai and Shimla, at the Cathedral and John Connon School and Bishop Cotton School (Shimla).[7] He received a B. Arch. degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962, and the Advanced Management Program from Harvard Business School in 1975.
Career[edit]
Tata began his career in the Tata group in 1961. He started on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone and handling the blast furnace.[8] He could not turn around group companies, NELCO and Empress Mills, which he was given charge of in the 70s.[9][10] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many company heads some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.[11] Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole,[12] with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on the onslaught of globalisation.
During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[9] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.[13][14] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries.[9][15] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[11] As he explained in a recent[when?] interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[16]
Ratan Tata relinquished all executive power in the Tata group on 28 December 2012, on turning 75, appointing as his successor, Cyrus Mistry, the 44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by marriage.[17][18] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant crisis.[19] On 12 January 2017 Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, a role he will assume in February 2017.
Recently, he invested his personal savings in Snapdeal - one of India's leading e-commerce website and in Jan 2016 made an undisclosed funding in Teabox — an online store selling premium Indian Tea [20] and CashKaro.com[21] — an online discount coupons and cashback website. Ratan Tata has been making small investments in both early and late stage companies in India. He made investments of INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs[22] and INR 1 Cr in Paytm.[23] In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi, with specific terms undisclosed.[24] In October 2015, he partnered with American Express in investing in Bitcoin venture Abra.[25] In Jan 2016, it was reported that Ratan Tata invested in an online Pet care portal called Dogspot.[26][27][28]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tata Hall[edit]
In the fall of 2010, HBS Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center.[29]
The executive center have been named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP '75), the chairman of Tata Sons.[30] The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million.[31] The Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, the facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.[32]

He has served in various capacities in organisations in India and abroad. He is a member of the 'Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry' and the 'National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council'. He is on the jury panel of Pritzker Architecture Prize[33] – considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes.

In February 2015, Ratan took an advisory role at Kalari Capital.[citation needed]
Recently, Ratan Tata has also invested an undisclosed amount in Nestaway in February 2016 [37]
In October, 2016, Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, nearly 4 years after he took over the reins of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Ratan Tata made a come back, taking over the company's interim boss for 4 months. A selection committee has been formed to find a successor in four months.

He was able to up the market share by 23%, but the company quickly began to decline, due to labor issues and the economy. He helped to turn around the Empress Mills, but, because he wasn't allowed the Rs 50 lakh he needed, the company hit bottom, and was shut down in 1986. Since then, Ratan has taken over the position of Tata Industries chairman, after JRD Tata stepped down, in 1981 and has become group chairman of the Tata group. He was responsible for obtaining many companies, such as, Tetley, Land Rover, Corus and Jacquar. Other major Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Teleservices, The Indian Hotels Company, Tata Power, Tata tea, and Tata Chemicals.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

If it stands the test of public scrutiny, do it... if it doesn't stand the test of public scrutiny then don't do it.
Ratan Tata


Stand,

The government should do its job. The government's job is, in fact, to run the country, to manage the country, to govern the country. And governance is an important thing, not application where it suits one so, to micro control where it suits them on the other hand.
Ratan Tata


Job,
Government,
Control

Ratan Tata


Simple,

I followed someone who had very large shoes. He had very large shoes. Mr. J. R. D. Tata. He was a legend in the Indian business community. He had been at the helm of the Tata organization for 50 years. You were almost starting to think he was going to be there forever.
Ratan Tata


Business,
Community,
Shoes



















I have two or three cars that I like, but today, Ferrari would be the best car I have driven in terms of being an impressive car.
