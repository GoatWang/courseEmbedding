The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

Nippon Telegraph And Telephone : Rubber firm in Taiwan taps Dimension data for regional collaboration

A Taiwanese manufacturer for industrial rubber products is working with Dimension Data to upgrade its internet telephony infrastructure in order to improve efficiency and optimize collaboration between its factories in Taiwan, mainland China and Thailand.
Experiencing steady growth, the rubber firm decided that it was strategic to invest in IPT technology with the addition of new capabilities such as web conferencing, to facilitate better communication among its manufacturing centres and administrative offices.
However, the company wanted a partner that was not only a unified communications expert, but also one with proven multi-country project execution capabilities.
The biggest challenge was upgrading the outdated IP telephony system that the client has been using for years, said Frank Liao, general manager at Dimension Data Taiwan.
With no automated migration tools available for this system, our teams familiarity and expertise with IP telephony systems made it possible for us to design and implement a smooth migration plan for the client, said Liao.
Dimension Data assigned a dedicated project team, developed a comprehensive plan with pre-launch testing and created a solution based on Cisco collaboration technologies. The project includes implementing Cisco Business Edition 7000 (BE7000) an all-in-one, end-to-end collaboration solution across five sites in Taiwan, China and Thailand.
Aside from upgrading the IPT system, the project also includes voice gateway migration, server virtualisation, Jabber instant messaging roll out for mobile users and the development of a private Cisco WebEx Meeting Centre.
The new IPT platform is scalable, less complex and much easier to manage. The use of Jabber and WebEx enables mobility and improves collaboration, as well as allowing comprehensive communications between internal colleagues, external partners and customers.
The goal was to achieve the business results quickly, increase team productivity, and lower costs, said Liao. Even though the project is not fully completed, the client is already seeing savings in a host of areas, such as international calls and travel expenses.(c)  2017 The Sun Publishing Limited.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (日本電信電話株式会社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kabushiki-gaisha), commonly known as NTT, is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 65th in Fortune Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue.
The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (Law Concerning Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Etc.).[3] The purpose of the company defined by the Law is to own all the shares issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone West Corporation (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.
While NTT is listed on Tokyo, Osaka, New York, and London stock exchanges, the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT's shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

History[edit]




NTT was established as a government-owned corporation in 1953


Established as a monopoly government-owned corporation in 1952, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (日本電信電話公社, Nippon Denshin Denwa Kōsha) was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.[4][5]
Because NTT owns most of the last mile (FTTC or FTTB/FTTH), it enjoys oligopolistic control over land lines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (NTT East, NTT West, and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short distance communications and obligates them to maintain telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.
In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data's entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.[6]
In late 2010, NTT's Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.[7]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
