Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Jounce Therapeutics, Inc Presents Phase 1 Data from Iconic Study of JTX-2011 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Jun 5 17
Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. announced that Phase 1 data from the company’s ICONIC study of JTX-2011 were presented in a poster (Abstract #192770) at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. JTX-2011 is a monoclonal antibody targeting ICOS, a protein found on the surface of certain T cells within many solid tumors. The preliminary data show JTX-2011 to be well-tolerated in doses up to 0.3 mg/kg as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 ICONIC (ICOS AgONist Antibody for Immunotherapy in Cancer Patients) study was a dose-escalation study to assess safety and tolerability of JTX-2011 and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JTX-2011 as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. The study enrolled patients with any advanced solid tumor who had disease progression after treatment with all available therapies known to confer clinical benefit. Unlike the ongoing Phase 2 study, the Phase 1 study did not include enrichment for patients with the ICOS biomarker. A summary of results as of May 12, 2017, is as follows: Forty-six subjects were dosed in six cohorts of escalating doses of JTX-2011 alone every three weeks and four cohorts of escalating doses of JTX-2011 plus nivolumab 240 mg IV every three weeks. Most adverse events were Grade 1 or 2, with the most common being chills, decreased appetite, nausea and fever. Infusion-related adverse events were reported in 10 participants at doses 0.003 mg/kg through 0.3 mg/kg in both monotherapy and combination. Immune related adverse events not associated with drug infusion were reported in six participants at doses at or above 0.03 mg/kg, including two dose-limiting toxicities at 1 mg/kg, resulting in a maximum tolerated dose for JTX-2011 monotherapy of 0.3 mg/kg. 0.3 mg/kg was selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose for JTX-2011 monotherapy based on safety and tolerability, target engagement, PK and peripheral blood immunophenotyping. Nine out of 12 monotherapy participants at the RP2D and 10 out of 12 combination therapy participants at all dose levels remain on study with limited duration of follow-up.

Operating loss was $0.247 million compared to operating loss of $10.901 million a year ago. Net income was $0.385 million compared to net loss of $10.890 million a year ago. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $0.409 million compared to net loss of $12.934 a year ago. Net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $0.02 compared to loss of $6.81 a year ago. 

The company expects collaboration revenue for the full year 2017 of approximately $80.0 million, representing the amortization of the Celgene upfront payment of $225.0 million received in 2016.


Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. Initiates Phase 2 Portion of Iconic Study of JTX-2011 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Apr 20 17
Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. announced enrollment of patients into the Phase 2 portion of the company’s Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011. JTX-2011 is a monoclonal antibody targeting ICOS, a protein found on the surface of certain T cells within many solid tumors The Phase 1 portion of the study focused on the identification of a Phase 2 dose based on pre-specified criteria of safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), in monotherapy (Part A) and in combination (Part B) with nivolumab (marketed as OPDIVO®). Safety and PK/PD data from Phase 1 Parts A and B will be presented in a poster titled, “Phase 1 safety of ICOS agonist antibody JTX-2011 alone and with nivolumab (nivo) in advanced solid tumors; predicted vs observed pharmacokinetics (PK) in ICONIC” at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting taking place June 2-6, 2017, in Chicago. The Phase 2 portion of the ICONIC study consists of two parts, each of which is intended to evaluate preliminary efficacy. Patient enrollment has commenced in Part C, which evaluates JTX-2011 as a monotherapy across more than three disease-specific expansion cohorts in solid tumors, including patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Each of these indications was identified by Jounce’s Translational Science Platform as having tumors displaying high percentages of ICOS-expressing T cells, the target of JTX-2011. In addition, individual patients will be stratified for levels of ICOS-expressing T cells in their tumors to ensure that sufficient numbers of patients with high ICOS expression, who may be more likely to respond, are enriched into each cohort.

Jounce Therapeutics Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsBack to JNCE Snapshot

Share Story8:00AM ET 5/09/2017 Globe Newswire- Completed upsized initial public offering raising $117.1 million in gross proceeds -- Presented preclinical data supporting ongoing Phase 1/2 ICONIC study -- Initiated Phase 2 portion of ICONIC study evaluating JTX-2011 in advanced solid tumors -
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JNCE), a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies coupled with predictive biomarkers for patient enrichment, today reported financial results and provided a corporate update for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
"Our successful IPO in the first quarter marked an important milestone for the company and has provided us the financial flexibility to focus on the execution of our lead clinical program, JTX-2011, and to continue to advance our earlier-stage targets emerging from our Translational Science Platform," said Richard Murray, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Jounce Therapeutics. "We continue to execute on our goal of being a leading next-generation immunotherapy company, having recently announced the start of the Phase 2 portion, designed to evaluate preliminary efficacy, of our Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The safety, PK and PD data from the Phase 1 portion of the study, launched last summer, will be presented at ASCO 2017, and we remain on track to disclose data from the Phase 2 preliminary efficacy evaluation by the end of the year."
Corporate Highlights:
Completed upsized initial public offering (IPO): In February 2017, Jounce completed its IPO of 7,319,750 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, including 954,750 shares of common stock issued upon the full exercise by underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. Gross proceeds from the IPO were approximately $117.1 million, or $106.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
Added to Russell Indexes®: Effective March 31, 2017, Jounce was added to the Russell 2000®, 3000® and Microcap® Indexes as part of Russell's quarterly additions of companies with recent IPOs.

Clinical Highlights:
Presented JTX-2011 preclinical data at American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting: In April 2017, Jounce presented preclinical data during an oral session at AACR that supports the ongoing Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011, an agonist monoclonal antibody targeting ICOS (Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator). Additionally, Jounce presented details on the design of the ICONIC study during a poster session at the meeting.
Initiated the Phase 2 portion of the ICONIC study of JTX-2011: In April 2017, the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011 was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patient enrollment has commenced in Part C of the study, which evaluates JTX-2011 as a monotherapy in at least three indication specific cohorts, including head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Part D portion, which is expected to begin enrolling in the second quarter of 2017, will evaluate JTX-2011 in combination with nivolumab and will include at least five cohorts, including HNSCC, NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer, melanoma and gastric cancer.

Upcoming Data Presentation: 
Jounce will report data from the Phase 1 portion of the ICONIC study of JTX-2011 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois.  The safety, PK and PD data from both monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab (marketed as OPDIVO®), will represent the first reported human data of the ICOS agonist approach in cancer immunotherapy.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results:
Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2017 were $340.0 million, compared to $257.4 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the $106.5 million in net proceeds from the IPO, offset by operating costs during the quarter.
Collaboration Revenue: Collaboration revenue was $20.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Jounce did not record any collaboration revenue during the same period in 2016. The increase in revenue was due to the Company's global strategic collaboration with Celgene, which it entered into in July 2016. Collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2017 reflected the amortization of the upfront payment of $225.0 million received from Celgene in 2016.
R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $15.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $8.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to $2.7 million in increased clinical costs related to the Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011 and $2.5 million in increased employee compensation costs related to increased headcount.
G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to $1.0 million in increased employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $0.9 million in increased facilities costs and $0.8 million in increased costs related to travel, insurance and audit and tax fees.
Net Income (Loss): Net income was $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, or a basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.02 as a result of preferred stock dividends that were accrued prior to the completion of the IPO, as compared to a net loss of $10.9 million for the same period in 2016, or a basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $6.81. The decrease in net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is primarily due to the completion of the IPO in February 2017, which resulted in the sale of 7,319,750 shares of common stock and the automatic conversion of 22,283,690 shares of convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock. 

Financial Guidance:Jounce reiterates the financial guidance previously provided for the full year 2017. Based on its current operating plan, Jounce expects to use approximately $100.0 to $120.0 million in cash for the full year 2017, including the projected expense of operating activities, build out and capital costs associated with the relocation of its lab and office space within Cambridge, Massachusetts and federal and state income taxes related to the receipt of the Celgene upfront payment of $225.0 million in 2016.
Jounce expects collaboration revenue for the full year 2017 of approximately $80.0 million, representing the amortization of the Celgene upfront payment of $225.0 million received in 2016.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: Various statements in this release concerning Jounce's future expectations, plans and prospects, including without limitation, Jounce's expectations regarding the timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for Jounce's product candidates and any future product candidates; the timing, scope or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals; and Jounce's ability to identify new targets for additional product candidates, to develop future product candidates and combination therapies, and to successfully commercialize and market products may constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee such outcomes. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including, without limitation, Jounce's ability to successfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its product candidates and future product candidates, the pre-clinical and clinical results for its product candidates, which may not support further development and marketing approval, the potential advantages of Jounce's product candidates, the development plans of its product candidates, actions of regulatory agencies, which may affect the initiation, timing and progress of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates, Jounce's anticipated milestones, Jounce's ability to obtain, maintain and protect its intellectual property, Jounce's ability to enforce its patents against infringers and defend its patent portfolio against challenges from third parties, the timing, cost or other aspects of a potential commercial launch of Jounce's product candidates and potential future sales of our current product candidates or any other potential products if any are approved for marketing, competition from others developing products for similar uses, Jounce's ability to manage operating expenses, Jounce's ability to maintain its collaboration with Celgene and establish or maintain future collaborations, Jounce's dependence on third parties for development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of product candidates, the outcome of litigation, and unexpected expenditures, as well as those risks more fully discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Jounce's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in Jounce's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

about our collaboration with celgene
In July 2016, we entered a global collaboration with Celgene focused on developing and commercializing innovative immuno-oncology treatments for patients with cancer. The collaboration includes options on our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, targeting ICOS, up to four early stage programs to be selected from a defined pool of B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets emerging from the Jounce Translational Science Platform and an additional option to equally share a checkpoint immuno-oncology program.
Learn More








ICOS Agonist Program – JTX-2011




Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator (ICOS), a protein on the surface of certain T cells that we believe will stimulate an immune response against a patient’s cancer. JTX-2011 is intended to treat solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other therapies, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the ICONIC trial.  JTX-2011 is based on insights generated by our founders, Drs. Jim Allison and Padmanee (Pam) Sharma, which showed that elevated expression of ICOS correlated with positive clinical outcomes and, subsequently, that providing an agonist signal through ICOS leads to anti-tumor activity in vivo. Their experience paved the way for our translational approach. Based on these insights and additional preclinical evidence, we initiated our ICOS program and:

Discovered an agonist monoclonal antibody clinical candidate, JTX-2011, which is currently in IND-enabling studies; and
Identified biomarkers that can be used to classify patients to look for enhanced response rates in our clinical trials

Beyond T Cells




Most first-wave immunotherapy treatments have focused on activating T cells within tumors, an approach that has successfully led to medicines that are making a difference in patients’ lives. However, many patients still do not achieve long-lasting responses on these treatments. This may occur for two reasons: (1) insufficient numbers of T cells within a certain tumor or tumor type; or (2) the presence of suppressive mechanisms that inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system. In both of these scenarios, therapies targeting T cells are less likely to be successful.
We believe that the ability to target different immune cell types, such as innate immune cells, may allow us to (1) pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target adaptive immune cells; as well as (2) potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune-activating environment.  We believe our differentiated approach to understanding and interrogating these other immune cell types competitively positions us to exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer.
Our translational approach led us to characterize large numbers of human tumors in which the innate immune or stromal mechanisms may be suppressing or repelling the immune system within the TME. We have strived to create a balanced pipeline with both T cell and Beyond T cell programs in order to optimize the use of the immune system, and to couple this pipeline with novel patient selection strategies.


Jounce’s lead Beyond T cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immune-suppressing to immune-activating.











The Tumor microenvironment
The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the cellular environment that makes up a tumor.  This environment includes blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, lymphocytes, signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix.
Our approach to identifying novel targets and mechanisms, while initially focused on TAMs, is a repeatable approach that we believe can be applied to other cell types in the tumor microenvironment.








tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)

ABOUT THE ICONIC TRIAL


The ICONIC trial (ICOS AgONist Antibody for Immunotherapy in Cancer Patients), with its four-part, adaptive design, will initially assess safety and tolerability, and then preliminary efficacy of JTX-2011 as both a monotherapy and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (marketed as OPDIVO®).
The initial phase of ICONIC will be a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The second phase of ICONIC will focus on disease-specific expansion cohorts in solid tumors that the Company has identified, using its Translational Science Platform, as having the highest numbers of ICOS-expressing T cells and other ICOS-related biomarkers, an approach supported by preclinical work. Jounce plans to enroll approximately 200 patients in the ICONIC trial at 12 premier oncology sites in the U.S.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

A Revolutionary Approach to Cancer Treatment

We are stepping outside the conventional approach to developing cancer immunotherapies by using our Translational Science Platform to prioritize targets and identify related biomarkers to match the right therapy to the right patients, thereby enabling enriched trial designs, which we believe will lead to shortened development timelines.













Mobilizing the Immune System to Attack Cancer
Our research and development strategy is to target specific mechanisms that match the composition of the immune system within the human tumor microenvironment (TME), with the goal of transforming the treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to attack tumors and bring long-lasting benefits to patients.
Our lead program, JTX-2011 – an ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody - complements existing cancer immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1 therapies, by binding to and activating ICOS, stimulating an immune response against the cancer.
We are also developing treatments that target other immune cells  – "Beyond T cells" – in order to help patients whose tumors are driven by mechanisms, such as immune-suppressive macrophages.

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $92.8 million, or $107.0 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares,
assuming an initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $30.0 million to advance JTX-2011 through the completion of our 
  multi-arm Phase I/II clinical trial, designed to provide safety and dosing 
  data, and clinical proof of concept efficacy data for JTX-2011 both as a 
  single agent and in combination with other therapies;

• approximately $25.0 million to advance JTX-4014 through Investigational New
  Drug, or IND, enabling studies and filings, and planned initial clinical
  studies for development as a combination agent;

• approximately $10.0 million to continue to advance and expand our 
  Translational Science Platform, and research and development pipeline,
  including both internal and external costs for IND enabling studies and early
  discovery efforts, including our beyond T effector cell activities; and

• use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which will include hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and
  the costs of operating as a public company.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities, together with the net proceeds to us from this offering,
will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twenty-four months.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies or
clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as our existing
collaboration with Celgene and any other collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties for JTX-2011, JTX-4014 or any future product candidates or
business development opportunities we may engage in for our programs and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which include corporate,
financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology
subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce
competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that
our product candidate, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience,
and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face
competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic
institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research
institutions, among others.

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will
compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become
available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to
effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and
convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any
complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. Our competitors fall
primarily into the following groups of treatment:

• Traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy;

• Approved immunotherapy antibodies, anti-CTLA 4 (Yervoy, marketed by Bristol
  Myers Squibb Company) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Opdivo, Keytruda
  and Tecentriq, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., and
  Genentech, Inc., respectively);

• Anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy antibodies in clinical trials, including
  those being developed by Merck KGaA and Pfizer, Inc. (avelumab in Phase III),
  MedImmune, Inc. (durvalumab in Phase III), MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI0680 in 
  Phase I), Incyte (SHR-1210 in Phase I), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 
  (BMS-936559 in Phase I), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Sanofi (REGN2810 in
  Phase I), Tesaro, Inc. (TSR-042 in Phase I), and Novartis AG (PDR-001 in 
  Phase I/II);

• An anti-ICOS program (GSK 3359609) in Phase I clinical trials, being developed
  by GlaxoSmithKline plc, for which patient enrollment began in the second 
  quarter of 2016;

• Other agonist immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development, including:
  anti-GITR antibodies being developed by Merck & Co., Inc. (MK-1248 and MK-4166
  in Phase I), Leap Therapeutics, Inc. (TRX518 in Phase I), Bristol-Myers Squibb
  Company (BMS-986156 in Phase I), MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI1873 in Phase I), Amgen
  Inc. (AMG 228 in Phase I), Novartis AG (GWN323 in Phase I) and Agenus, 
  Inc./Incyte Corporation (INCAGN01876 in Phase I); anti-CD137 antibodies being
  developed by Pfizer, Inc. (utomilumab in Phase I) and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
  Company (urelumab in Phase II); anti-OX40 antibodies being developed by 
  MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI6469 in Phase I), Pfizer (PF-04518600 in Phase I), 
  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS-986178 in Phase I/II), Genentech, Inc. 
  (MOXR0916 in Phase I) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK 3174998 in Phase I); and 
  an anti-CD27 antibody being developed by Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. 
  (varlilumab in Phase I/II); and

• Therapies targeting macrophages, including: antagonists of CSF1R being
  developed by Plexxikon Inc. (PLX3397 in Phase III) and anti-CSF1R antibody
  being developed by Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
  Company (FPA008 in Phase I), Roche Holding AG (RO5509554 in Phase I), and Eli
  Lily & Co. (IMC-CS4 in Phase I); and an anti-M-CSF antibody being developed by
  Pfizer, Inc. (PD-0360324 in Phase I); antagonists of CD47 being developed by 
  Forty Seven, Inc. (CAMELLIA in Phase I), Celgene (CC-90002 in Phase I), and
  Trillium Therapeutics, Inc. (TTI-621 in Phase I).

The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors
will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their
products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result
in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to
enter the market.

Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater
financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing,
preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals
and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may
also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also
compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management
personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for
clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or
necessary for, our programs.


Company Description
We are a clinical stage immunotherapy company dedicated to transforming the
treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to
attack tumors and provide long-lasting benefits to patients. Through the use of
our Translational Science Platform, we first focus on specific


 cell types within
tumors to prioritize targets, and then identify related biomarkers designed to
match the right therapy to the right patient. Our strategy is to create
immunotherapies targeting a variety of the diverse cellular components of the
immune system, as well as non-immune cells resident within the tumor, all of
which can vary greatly among tumors within and across indications. This may
provide benefit to patients with tumors across the spectrum from highly
inflamed, or hot, to poorly inflamed, or cold, and especially those not well
served by current therapies. We believe the early identification of potential
predictive biomarkers to prospectively enrich for biomarker positive cancer
patients, from across many indications, may lead to shortened development
timelines for our new immunotherapies. Our approach is designed to lead to a
larger effect size by first identifying and then focusing on a smaller biomarker
positive study population. Through this two-pronged approach, we believe our
Translational Science Platform enables us to effectively and efficiently
identify and develop new cancer immunotherapies.

• Targeting T cells: Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, is a clinical stage
  monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates ICOS, a protein on the surface
  of certain T cells commonly found in many solid tumors. We believe our 
  JTX-2011 antibody has a dual mechanism of action that serves to amplify an 
  immune response in T effector cells, or "good" T cells, while preferentially 
  reducing the number of T regulatory cells, or "bad" T cells, within a tumor. 
  Our preclinical data demonstrates that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant 
  T cell immune response against solid tumors. We submitted our Investigational
  New Drug Application, or IND, for JTX-2011 to the Food and Drug 
  Administration, or FDA, in July 2016 and began our JTX-2011 multi-arm Phase 
  I/II clinical trial in patients with solid tumors in August 2016. We believe 
  JTX-2011 has the potential to act both as a single agent and more importantly
  in combination with other therapies, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, to offer 
  treatment alternatives to patients who otherwise lack an effective response to
  currently approved therapies. We are also conducting IND enabling studies for
  JTX-4014, an anti-PD-1 antibody for use in future combinations with JTX-2011 
  as well as for use in combination with other future product candidates, as we 
  believe combination therapy has the potential to be a mainstay of cancer 
  immunotherapy. Safety data from our multi-arm Phase I/II JTX-2011 trial is 
  expected in the first half of 2017, and preliminary efficacy proof of concept
  data is expected in the second half 2017 in both the single agent and 
  combination setting.

• Beyond T effector cells: We are discovering and developing immunotherapies
  beyond the currently approved products targeting T effector cells. To do so, 
  we are leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and 
  comprehensively interrogate cell types within the human tumor 
  microenvironment, or TME, to enable us to develop therapies with the potential
  to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from hot to cold. This 
  includes focusing on adaptive and innate immune cells, such as B and T 
  regulatory cells, and immunosuppressive macrophages, respectively. Therapies 
  targeting these cell types and cell subsets may have the potential to 
  complement existing approaches that focus on T effector cells and thereby 
  benefit many patients who do not respond to the currently approved T effector
  cell-focused immunotherapies. In addition, we are discovering and developing 
  multiple approaches, including targeting stromal cells, with the potential to
  convert cold tumors to hot tumors, thereby making the tumors more amenable to
  immunotherapy, perhaps in combination approaches.

• Identifying potential predictive biomarkers to prioritize indications and
  match the right therapy to the right patients: Early in the development
  process, we use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential
  predictive biomarkers designed to enable us to enrich for a patient population
  more likely to respond to our immunotherapy. In addition we can also use 
  characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications
  and/or niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy. By 
  taking this biomarker-driven approach, which supports enriched-enrollment 
  clinical trial design by stratifying patients and focusing on the biomarker 
  positive patients whose tumors express our biomarker(s) of interest, we 
  believe that we can more efficiently develop our cancer immunotherapies. The 
  biomarker results, coordinated to clinical response, will determine the 
  utility of proceeding to the use of a complementary diagnostic and/or 
  companion diagnostic for a given therapy.

Our ability to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers using our
Translational Science Platform was a key component leading to our recently
announced strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. This
global strategic collaboration, which included a $225.0 million upfront payment
and a $36.1 million equity investment, is primarily focused on co-developing and
co-commercializing innovative biologic immunotherapy treatments for patients
with cancer. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to
develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, and up to four
early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain
B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets. Additionally,
Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product
candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared
program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration.
Under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all
programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United
States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four-year
research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn additional
clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments,
option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. In addition to
progressing collaboration programs, we will continue to use our Translational
Science Platform to progress our own programs that are not part of the
collaboration and for which we retain worldwide commercial rights.

Immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer
therapy and are beginning to fundamentally change the paradigm for treating
patients. Fewer than half of all cancer patients respond to single agent
immunotherapies. Combination therapies are beginning to yield greater responses
than single agent therapies, yet there is still significant unmet medical need
among large patient populations across most solid tumor indications. In
addition, there is a significant number of patients with tumors that lack, or
have low levels of, immune cell infiltrate where additional approaches may be
required to fully realize the benefit of immunotherapy agents. We believe
targeting novel immune mechanisms in combination with identifying and using
predictive biomarkers may best address these areas of unmet need.

Our Translational Science Platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies
to comprehensively profile the cellular and molecular characteristics within
thousands of human solid tumors, providing critical information about the TME
that we believe will allow us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more
efficiently through development. We utilize a systematic approach to match
targets to defined patient populations, as well as niche indications and/or
niche subsets within indications, that we believe are more likely to benefit
from these therapies. Building on our biomarker-driven strategy, we aim to
establish complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics for each of our
product candidates to identify the right patients for treatment.

JTX-2011, our lead program, has shown preclinical anti-tumor effects both as a
single agent and in combination with existing immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1
antibodies. Single agent efficacy in preclinical models is correlated with the 
percentage of ICOS-expressing T cells in the tumor. Using our Translational 
Science Platform, we have identified human cancer indications that display high
percentages of ICOS-expressing T cells and ICOS-related biomarkers within the 
tumors. Based on this, we have prioritized certain indications, including 
non-small cell lung cancer or NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell cancer or 
HNSCC, and additional niche indications for evaluation in our ongoing JTX-2011 
single agent trial. Furthermore, individual patient tumors from the selected 
indications will be evaluated during clinical trial enrollment for ICOS and 
related biomarkers so that we can enrich our trials with patients who may be 
more likely to respond to JTX-2011. We are also using our Translational Science
Platform and biomarker-driven strategy to identify additional niche indications
and/or niche subsets within indications that may be particularly amenable to 
JTX-2011 therapy and may provide additional patient populations for evaluation 
in our clinical studies. In addition, because existing immunotherapies such as 
anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies may induce ICOS upregulation on T cells, we 
believe that in a combination setting, JTX-2011 may exert anti-tumor activity in
a broader group of indications and thus provide benefit to a greater number of 
patients. As a result, our ongoing Phase I/II multi-arm trial will also assess 
the safety and efficacy of JTX-2011 in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody,
nivolumab, in patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, triple negative breast cancer, or 
TNBC, melanoma, stomach cancer and additional niche indications identified 
through our Translational Science Platform. Assuming continued successful 
development, our expectation is that our anti-PD-1 antibody JTX-4014, that is 
currently in IND-enabling studies, will be included in subsequent clinical 
studies.

The majority of immunotherapy discovery and development efforts have focused on
T cell targeted therapies, particularly T effector cells, which have provided
long-lasting benefits to some patients, but significant unmet medical need
remains. As such, we have focused our early discovery efforts on interrogating
multiple cell types. We believe our approach will identify novel immunotherapies
that engage different elements of the immune system and stroma and can address
the broader unmet medical need across solid tumor indications. Our discovery
pipeline consists of multiple programs, including several that target
immunosuppressive macrophages, which are highly prevalent in many solid tumor
types, as well as programs aimed at converting cold tumors to hot tumors. We
believe these approaches may create options for patients who are less likely to
respond to currently approved therapies, as well as enhance responses in
patients who have had limited response to currently approved immunotherapies.

Cancer Immunotherapy



Cancer immunotherapy aims to treat patients by mobilizing the immune system to recognize and attack tumors. Based on the groundbreaking initial research and discoveries by our founders, we aim to revolutionize the immunotherapy field through our translational science platform.













What makes us different Advancing a pipeline of innovative cancer therapies




Immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer therapy and are beginning to fundamentally change the paradigm for treating patients.  However, due to a general lack of predictive biomarkers to identify responsive patient populations, fewer than half of all cancer patients respond to these immunotherapies as single agents. Combination therapies are beginning to yield greater responses than single agent therapies, although there is still significant unmet medical need across large patient populations.


Developing unparalleled immunologic insights into tumors in order to match the right therapies to the right patients









Our Translational Science Platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics within thousands of human solid tumors, providing critical information on the tumor micro-environment (TME) that allows us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more efficiently through development.  We utilize a systematic approach to match targets to defined patient populations that we believe are more likely to benefit from these therapies – allowing us to distinguish and prioritize targets versus making a more random choice.  If our biomarker-driven strategies are successful, we anticipate developing a companion diagnostic for each product. We believe that we can facilitate a systematic means of novel immunotherapy discovery, enroll biomarker-defined patient populations in clinical trials, and develop therapies, alone or in combination, that will have a meaningful and long-lasting impact on the lives of cancer patients.
What does that mean for patients? If our strategies are successful, we anticipate more robust and rapid achievement of human proof of concept and shorter times to deliver novel therapies to patients with unmet needs.

about our collaboration with celgene
In July 2016, we entered a global collaboration with Celgene focused on developing and commercializing innovative immuno-oncology treatments for patients with cancer. The collaboration includes options on our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, targeting ICOS, up to four early stage programs to be selected from a defined pool of B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets emerging from the Jounce Translational Science Platform and an additional option to equally share a checkpoint immuno-oncology program.

ICOS Agonist Program – JTX-2011




Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator (ICOS), a protein on the surface of certain T cells that we believe will stimulate an immune response against a patient’s cancer. JTX-2011 is intended to treat solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other therapies, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the ICONIC trial.  JTX-2011 is based on insights generated by our founders, Drs. Jim Allison and Padmanee (Pam) Sharma, which showed that elevated expression of ICOS correlated with positive clinical outcomes and, subsequently, that providing an agonist signal through ICOS leads to anti-tumor activity in vivo. Their experience paved the way for our translational approach. Based on these insights and additional preclinical evidence, we initiated our ICOS program and:

Discovered an agonist monoclonal antibody clinical candidate, JTX-2011, which is currently in IND-enabling studies; and
Identified biomarkers that can be used to classify patients to look for enhanced response rates in our clinical trials

Beyond T Cells




Most first-wave immunotherapy treatments have focused on activating T cells within tumors, an approach that has successfully led to medicines that are making a difference in patients’ lives. However, many patients still do not achieve long-lasting responses on these treatments. This may occur for two reasons: (1) insufficient numbers of T cells within a certain tumor or tumor type; or (2) the presence of suppressive mechanisms that inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system. In both of these scenarios, therapies targeting T cells are less likely to be successful.
We believe that the ability to target different immune cell types, such as innate immune cells, may allow us to (1) pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target adaptive immune cells; as well as (2) potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune-activating environment.  We believe our differentiated approach to understanding and interrogating these other immune cell types competitively positions us to exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer.
Our translational approach led us to characterize large numbers of human tumors in which the innate immune or stromal mechanisms may be suppressing or repelling the immune system within the TME. We have strived to create a balanced pipeline with both T cell and Beyond T cell programs in order to optimize the use of the immune system, and to couple this pipeline with novel patient selection strategies.


Jounce’s lead Beyond T cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immune-suppressing to immune-activating.











The Tumor microenvironment
The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the cellular environment that makes up a tumor.  This environment includes blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, lymphocytes, signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix.
Our approach to identifying novel targets and mechanisms, while initially focused on TAMs, is a repeatable approach that we believe can be applied to other cell types in the tumor microenvironment.

ABOUT THE ICONIC TRIAL


The ICONIC trial (ICOS AgONist Antibody for Immunotherapy in Cancer Patients), with its four-part, adaptive design, will initially assess safety and tolerability, and then preliminary efficacy of JTX-2011 as both a monotherapy and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (marketed as OPDIVO®).
The initial phase of ICONIC will be a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The second phase of ICONIC will focus on disease-specific expansion cohorts in solid tumors that the Company has identified, using its Translational Science Platform, as having the highest numbers of ICOS-expressing T cells and other ICOS-related biomarkers, an approach supported by preclinical work. Jounce plans to enroll approximately 200 patients in the ICONIC trial at 12 premier oncology sites in the U.S.
