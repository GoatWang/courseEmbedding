      billion increase in market value since January 18, 2017 reflecting 
      optimism that Mr. Harrison may join as Chief Executive Officer, and 
      effect a transformation of CSX to a Precision Scheduled Railroading

      for several weeks. While we had hoped to reach a negotiated agreement, 
      we appreciate that CSX shareholders will have the opportunity to make 
      their voices heard on the optimal governance and compensation structure 
      that will create the conditions for a successful transformation. We 
      remain fully confident in a favorable outcome for CSX and its 
      shareholders and are excited for the future.”
    

      Hunter Harrison added, “If we create the right conditions for success, 
      we have the best chances for success.”

Mantle Ridge Sends Letter to CSX Board






February 16, 2017 06:02 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mantle Ridge LP (“Mantle Ridge”), an investment firm that owns 
      approximately 4.9% of the outstanding common shares of CSX Corp. 
      (NASDAQ:CSX) (the “Company”), today sent the following letter to the CSX 
      Board of Directors.
    


      February 16, 2017
    

      Edward J. Kelly, IIIPresiding DirectorCSX Corporation500 
      Water Street, 15th FloorJacksonville, FL 32202
    

      Dear Ned:
    

      I read with interest your press release announcing a special meeting to 
      poll shareholders on their views about our proposals.
    

      Hunter and I are committed exclusively to finding ways to maximize 
      shareholder value here. We know that the Board shares this objective.
    

      Because every day’s delay in beginning to implement Precision Scheduled 
      Railroading (PSR) under conditions that enable its success costs the 
      Company dearly, it is in the shareholders’ best interest that we 
      promptly resolve this through negotiation rather than wait months. 
      Continuing the exploration for common ground makes sense. As I have said 
      in my earliest communications with you, and in each correspondence 
      since, I am convinced there is ample room for agreement. We have been 
      standing by since last week for constructive counterproposals and we are 
      ready to discuss them as they arrive.
    

      Early on in this process, I explained that we were looking to you to 
      help us shape a solution that the Board would embrace, and that would 
      best advance the shareholders’ objective of a swift and certain 
      transformation. I made that clear in my January 24th letter 
      to the Board. The relevant passage is below:
    

“You Are Necessarily the Leader of this Process


      For a variety of reasons, you are uniquely positioned to lead: you know 
      the Company, the people, and the dynamics at the Board and in the 
      executive ranks; you have had dealings with me, and you know Hunter by 
      reputation; you have engineered countless deals; and you have been 
      through a somewhat similar (but the differences are greater than the 
      similarities) experience in the past. We seek your guidance in 
      supporting your leadership.”
    

      We remain hopeful, Ned, that you and we can together craft a solution 
      that works for all. If so the shareholder wins big.
    

      In the spirit of continuing to engage with you pending the special 
      meeting, I thought it would be useful for me to give you some high-level 
      input on what you said in the press release, to discuss process, and a 
      proposed path forward.
    

Governance


      The press release suggests that Mantle Ridge is looking for “substantial 
      board representation.” In fact, we are requesting only a single Mantle 
      Ridge representative on the Board (me). Neither Hunter nor the other 
      Board slots we discussed represents Mantle Ridge in any way.
    

      The press release goes on to say that Mantle Ridge wants to designate 
      six directors and suggests that granting our ask would grant us 
      effective control. In fact, you and I were engaged in a process to 
      identify high quality independent people that the Board and Mantle Ridge 
      could embrace. As part of that process, I gave you a list (including 
      lengthy bios) of 11 exceptional individuals with broad and relevant 
      experience. None of them has any relationship with me outside of my 
      efforts to recharge the CSX Board. Each one is entirely 
      independent of me and is committed to acting in the best interests of 
      all of the shareholders. Each one would make a superb board member.
    

      You indicated to me that you were impressed with the list. You agreed 
      that the Board would not consider any of the people on the list 
      surrogates of mine, or anything but truly independent and qualified. I 
      offered to arrange for you and the governance committee to meet any or 
      all of the candidates. You assured me that there was no need to do that, 
      since you were confident that together we could settle on people from 
      that list once we settled on the other issues.
    

      Why are we asking that new directors be added? As we’ve discussed, 
      Precision Scheduled Railroading requires dramatic operational and 
      cultural change. Change like that starts at the top, with significant 
      new blood on the Board not wed to the old ways or legacy decisions and 
      with no ties to any previous strategy or any one. The messaging to all 
      concerned constituencies that the external change agent – Hunter – is 
      coming in with very substantial support empowers Hunter. Conversely, 
      without enormous board support, the outcome and rate of the 
      transformation will be at risk. As Hunter said in our own press release, 
      “if we create the right conditions for success, we have the best chances 
      for success.”
    

      When I mentioned “conditions for success,” you asked what that means. I 
      explained to you and the rest of the Board that the conditions at CP 
      were ideal (from early on during the transformation, new independent 
      directors comprised a majority of the board). But I also said I think 
      that something less than that would be workable at CSX and that I was 
      open to exploring any proposals that you suggested could work. More 
      generally, I have said repeatedly, that my view of how well a proposed 
      governance deal will affect Hunter’s ability to succeed is based on an 
      assessment of roll-offs, additions, and board roles/committees. No one 
      of these dimensions can be considered on its own. They are a package. It 
      is a balancing act. And different packages and permutations can work. 
      The question before us is which package or permutation is acceptable to 
      the Board, and sufficiently empowers Hunter to deliver for the 
      shareholders.
    

      I must confess, however, I was made somewhat cautious during this 
      process. The Board’s letter to Hunter proposed that he be hired for only 
      two years, not the four we explained was necessary. This raised concerns 
      relating to the Board’s commitment to the transformation. That lack of 
      commitment could create material risk to the timely and successful 
      implementation of PSR. Having lived this, I cannot overemphasize the 
      risk this brings to our delivering to shareholders the swift and certain 
      transformation they want and expect.
    

      With that in mind, I told you that the addition of three independent 
      directors the Board offered was better than its initial offer of two. I 
      suggested you take four back for consideration.
    

      I also made clear that I was open to different approaches concerning how 
      quickly the Board size comes down. I note that Tuesday’s press release 
      could be read to say we were looking for the Board to drop down to 12 
      after John Breaux ages out in 2018. I never made that ask, and in fact I 
      had just assumed that the reconstituted Board would find a replacement 
      when he chooses to step down. I said that I considered Mr. Breaux a 
      valuable member of the Board and explicitly said more than once that a 
      retirement age cap should not get in the way of his continuing to serve 
      for many years if that was his preference. I continue to hope he stays 
      for a while.
    

      Similarly, when we discussed committee composition and leadership, I 
      gave you my thoughts but made clear that when the time comes we would 
      sit down and agree on a list. I said that it made sense for the new 
      directors to occupy a minority of the committee chairs. I explained that 
      the committees that were most important for the transformation to 
      succeed were Governance and Compensation and that it made sense that two 
      of the independents occupy those.
    

      For avoidance of doubt, Mantle Ridge has been seeking to add to the 
      Board only one representative, plus Hunter, plus independent people. The 
      sole prism through which we should evaluate the number of new directors 
      that should be added to the Board is the best interests of the Company. 
      That the board restructuring we are discussing comes in connection with 
      an activist whose holdings are 5% of the Company, or 1%, or 15% is 
      irrelevant. The size and nature of the restructuring should be solely a 
      function of the shareholders’ best interests, which I think you agree 
      requires installing Hunter and creating the conditions for him to 
      succeed. No other consideration – the size of the proposing shareholder 
      or otherwise – should be a factor. Mantle Ridge is in no way seeking or 
      gaining control, and remains open to discussions about the details. This 
      is not a “battle for control”.
    

Compensation


      The press release suggests that Hunter is asking for a $300 million 
      compensation package. In our view, that’s a major mischaracterization. 
      Regrettably, it has confused the shareholders.
    

      Hunter’s compensation package adds up to approximately $32 million per 
      year for four years, of which approximately $20 million per year is 
      explicitly performance based and should therefore be discounted in the 
      customary and substantial way performance based grants normally get 
      discounted for compensation and accounting purposes.
    

      In addition to Hunter’s compensation package, there is a one-time cost 
      of extraction from CP (i.e., the value Hunter forfeited in order to free 
      him up from his two-year non-compete and allow him to work at CSX), 
      which should not be viewed as compensation. That cost is $84 million 
      plus a gross up of somewhere between $0 and $23 million (depending on 
      Hunter’s tax position). Importantly, as you know, in no way does Mantle 
      Ridge receive any economic gain from this arrangement. As a matter of 
      fact, Mantle Ridge’s investors assumed this liability to effect the 
      release of Mr. Harrison from his non-compete and make him available to 
      solve CSX’s succession problem. This just covers that cost.
    

      Aside from our different ways of characterizing the one-time cost of 
      extraction, the main difference between our number and yours is the 
      value of the option grant. The $160 million referenced in the Company’s 
      press release confuses the matter. That figure does not fairly represent 
      the economic cost of this package to the Company, or its value to 
      Hunter. And it should not be the basis for evaluating the package.
    

      As you and I discussed, in our view the proper way to think about that 
      value is to view it against the unaffected stock price of $36.88 rather 
      than today’s “Hunter rally” price. The market has already baked in 
      anticipated strong execution by Hunter worth $10 per share and, since 
      his strike price will be based on the inflated date-of-grant price, 
      Hunter will receive no in-the-money value for that first $10 per share 
      of his value creation. For this reason, we believe the economically 
      correct view is that he was granted an option that is $10 per share out 
      of the money on the day of grant. Viewed that way, the Black-Scholes 
      value of the grant is only $78 million, and half of that grant is 
      performance based (based on goals that no other CEO in this industry has 
      reached) and as such should be accounted for at a large discount. It 
      only has meaningful value if Hunter knocks the cover off the ball, in 
      which case the magnitude of the package would be de minimis relative to 
      the value he uniquely could create. And it would certainly be deserved.
    

      This is the correct characterization of the economic cost of the package 
      to shareholders and the economic value to Hunter. We had discussed this 
      verbally a couple of times and you seemed to follow the analysis and 
      accept the conclusion.
    

      Importantly, because under the proposal Hunter’s options are so far out 
      of the money relative to the pre-Hunter price, it is important that we 
      never lose sight of the fact that his package is worth very little 
      unless he performs spectacularly.
    

      As with the governance proposal, we are looking for your guidance in 
      shaping a deal that works for all.
    

Process


      Ned, a lot of the points you raised in the press release could easily 
      have been addressed through continued back and forth, but the back and 
      forth stopped. Hunter and I (and our counsel) repeatedly asked for a 
      counter on the compensation and governance terms, but we never received 
      one. Instead, we have a special meeting that will distract current 
      management and – more importantly – will delay roll out of PSR and 
      disrupt the Company’s operations. When you compare this cost with the 
      cost of the questions at issue, it becomes clear that the Board should 
      redouble its effort to get a settlement. Again, you are clearly the best 
      party to get us there, and we continue to look to you for guidance on 
      proposals that would work.
    

      With that in mind, as you and I gear up for the special meeting, I 
      remain open to engaging constructively with you in a way that could 
      bring this to a more rapid and satisfactory close for the shareholders.
    

Proposal


      Over the last 24 hours, I have spoken to many shareholders of the 
      Company. Without exception, they share our eagerness to get Hunter into 
      the seat as quickly as possible under conditions for success that would 
      enable him replicate the CP transformation. They agree that the cost to 
      the Company of delaying this outcome until a Special Meeting gets 
      scheduled in April, or possibly later, is dear. None of us wants to wait.
    

      I would ask the Board to consider the clarification of the underlying 
      economics of Hunter’s compensation package we provide above and to 
      reconsider whether they can consider accepting it, or at least providing 
      a counter proposal.
    

      Concerning the governance proposal, this is a soft and tricky exercise 
      in judgment that balances additions, roll-offs, and roles/committees. If 
      the Board can commit to a process that promptly gets us to a four-year 
      deal with Hunter, that will in my mind be a sufficient gesture of 
      commitment that we can go forward with the addition of me and Hunter and 
      three of the independent directors (rather than the four in our last 
      proposal), with continued discussion concerning roll-offs, committee 
      composition, and roles.
    

      Ned, we have come a long way. We are close. We owe it to the 
      shareholders to get a deal done promptly. Let’s do it. If you are 
      willing, we are glad to meet in person and hammer this out this weekend, 
      hopefully delivering good news to the shareholders early next week.
    

      As before, I've taken the liberty of copying the other members of the 
      Board as well as Ms. Fitzsimmons. Ms. Fitzsimmons, please pass on copies 
      of this letter to every other Board member.
    

      Very truly yours,
