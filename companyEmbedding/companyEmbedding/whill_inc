WHILL, Inc. Key Developments

National Seating & Mobility Partners with WHILL Inc. on Exclusive Distribution of Next Generation Power Wheelchair
Jul 24 17
National Seating & Mobility and WHILL, Inc. are partnering on a nationwide distribution agreement for WHILL’s next generation mobility device. NSM will be the exclusive national distributor of the new, FDA-cleared Model M power wheelchair. NSM’s national distribution channel and expert clinical field team vastly increase the Model M service area in the Complex Rehab Technology and Access industry. The Model M will be available through NSM and AccessNSM branches nationwide.


Whill Inc, Develops New Model Whill Model C
May 1 17
Whill Inc. announced that it has developed a new model, 'Whill Model C,' and will start shipment in June 2017 in Japan. The price of the Model C is ¥450,000 (approx USD 4,131, excluding tax), which is less than half the price of the "Model A" (existing product, ¥995,000). Unlike the Model A, the Model C can be separated into three parts without using a tool and carried in a passenger car, etc, and its rechargeable battery can be detached. Specifically, the Model C can be separated into the chair, driving part (rear wheels) and front wheels. For this feature, Whill employed a two wheeldrive (2WD) mechanism in place of the fourwheeldrive (4WD) mechanism used for the Model A. The company newly developed an inwheel motor in cooperation with Nidec Corp. However, the Model C can run over up to 5cmhigh bumps while the Model A can run over up to 7.5cmhigh bumps. And the length of the Model C is 985mm, which is about 10cm longer than that of the Model A (890mm). The length was increased to improve stability when the wheelchair is running down a hill, etc. On the other hand, the 2WD mechanism eliminates the need for the part that drives the front wheels, reducing the weight by 64kg (from 116kg to 52kg). The rechargeable battery of the Model C can be detached and charged in a room, etc. The battery of the Model A needs to be charged by connecting a charger to the main unit. Whill developed the new battery module in collaboration with Panasonic Corp.


WHILL and 5D Robotics Collaborate to Accelerate Autonomous Personal Mobility Development
Apr 11 16

The first public demonstration is scheduled to take place at the RoboUniverse Conference & Expo in New York, April 11-12, 2016.

He was a wheelchair user who did not like the negative attention he got while using his wheelchair in public. He was seen as weak or ill, someone who needed the help of a large, imposing, unsightly machine to help him get around. As a friend, we knew him to be amazingly independent, fun loving and very social. We wanted everyone to be able to see the true person, the person we knew. So we set out to create a mobility device that would empower our friend, enable him to be himself and to do the things he wanted to with confidence and enthusiasm. A mobility device that would change the way he felt in public and one that would change how the public felt about him!After a year of development, we not only gave our friend a revolutionary new vehicle, but we also exhibited our work at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. We were overwhelmed by the positive reaction from all over the world. We realized that many people desired this kind of innovation and new found freedom in the mobility industry. We saw how meaningful what we were creating could be for people with mobility issues.This is why we founded WHILL.Through ongoing development and production of Personal EVs, we will challenge today’s conventions and improve the personal mobility experience. As we do, we will redefine the perception of wheelchairs and their limitations through innovative design and advanced technology. Nobody should be limited because they don’t feel comfortable with how they move from point A to point B. We want every individual to be confident, comfortable and independent.

Awards & Recognition































All Directional 4WDTM
We’ve taken our deep expertise in the automobile industry and applied the technology to personal mobility, enabling faster, effortless maneuverability in tight spaces and varied terrain. The All Directional Wheel Technology enables you to rotate with a minimal turning radius, making WHILL the highest performance motorized mobility vehicle in the industry.










Thrive in Any Environment
High power torque and large front wheels conquer rough terrains ad steep hills. Maneuver over grass, dirt, gravel, and snow with ease.






Set Your Pace
Our Acceleration Management System enables you to customize the speed and movement of your WHILL to better fit your driving preferences: fast, highly responsive control navigation or more subtle and easy control response. Better yet, you can control turn forward and reverse speed acceleration using the intuitive and easy-to-use WHILL app.







Remote Control
Wireless Bluetooth connectivity gives you the ability to control WHILL Model A even when not riding. Park your WHILL away from you when sitting on the couch to save space in the living room. Or let your companion control the remote while walking beside you, and not behind you, when having a conversation.





Speed Setting
Adjust speed and acceleration preferences on the fly to accommodate any situation. This provides versatility for indoor and outdoor use. For example, you can choose between Comfort Mode for a gentle driving experience inside your house and Active Mode to move quickly for when you take your dog for a walk at the park.







Seat Slide
You can have easy table access and transfer pivot points at your fingertips. Control the seat slide feature on your screen to make it easy to operate for everyone including people who have difficulties reaching the physical buttons on the side of WHILL’s arm.





GPS Mapping
Track the location of WHILL through integrated GPS in case your loved ones get lost. This Map screen can also tell you how fast WHILL is moving as well as how much battery power is charged on your WHILL.







Move Freely
Gently lift the arms to put them in an up position and out of your way. Now you have more space to move.





Easy Access
WHILL Model A’s seat glides forward and back, allowing smooth transfers on and off the vehicle and flexible table seating.





Mouse Controller
An intuitive and minimalistic mouse control model. Controllers are highly accurate and interchangeable for right and left-handed users.





Ergonomical Controller
Designed to fit the contour between your thumb and index finger for effortless navigation. Controllers are highly accurate and interchangeable for right and left-handed users.





Leave Nothing Behind
A subtle hanger on WHILL’s backrest takes your backpack wherever you need to go, keeping your most important belongings safe and secure.





Accessories
Keep your path visible by adding a flashlight that fits perfectly on the sides. WHILL is compatible with other accessories such as cupholders and smartphone holders.

Our highly skilled engineers are committed to keeping your WHILL like the day you received it.
