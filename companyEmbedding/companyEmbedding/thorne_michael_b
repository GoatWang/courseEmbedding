Find out whether the supplements you’re taking are having the intended effects.
 

Taking dietary supplements can help improve our health in a variety of ways, particularly when our bodies aren’t otherwise getting everything they need to function optimally. To fully understand their effectiveness, it’s important to validate the intended effects. Measuring select biomarkers through blood tests is one of the best ways to confirm whether supplementation is having the effects you and your doctor intended.

WellnessFX offers a variety of blood tests crafted specifically for people working to better understand and improve their health.



Convenient
Once you purchase a WellnessFX test, you’ll then get a quick and easy blood draw at any nearby Quest Diagnostics lab. You can make an appointment at the lab or just walk in.



Meaningful Insights
Your test results are all visualized as easy-to-understand charts, and accompanied by  explanations. Stay on top of your health by watching trends and changes in your health over time.



Private & Secure
We adhere to strict HIPAA compliance standards so your health data is private and safe in your account.

Because Thorne Research can't possibly know the health-related conditions or circumstances of patients, it means we can't make any recommendations or offer any advice to them.
A patient or a consumer should always consult with his or her health-care professional before taking any nutritional dietary supplement. This is particularly true if you have liver or kidney problems, if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you are taking a prescription medication or other nutritional supplements.
The Suggested Use for every Thorne Research product is listed on individual product pages at the INGREDIENTS tab.
The presence of potential food allergens (such as soy, wheat, dairy, fish, etc.) for those Thorne Research products that contain them is listed on individual product pages at the STATEMENTS AND WARNINGS tab.

Product Description
Basic B Complex consists of a group of eight water-soluble compounds: thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), cobalamin (vitamin B12), folate, and biotin. Although each B vitamin is chemically distinct, they often work together in various biochemical functions throughout the body – from cellular energy production, to healthy red-blood-cell formation, to healthy neurological function.* Most B vitamins, with the exception of vitamin B12, are not stored in the body; consequently, they must be acquired daily from the diet in order to maintain optimal health.*Supplementing with active B vitamins is extremely important to everyone, especially individuals who may not be able to convert non-active vitamins to their active forms in the liver because of compromised liver function, poorly functioning enzymes, digestive disturbances, or age.* Dietary supplements containing these active cofactors have enhanced bioavailability, ensuring the body gets the nutrients it needs.*Thorne Research's Basic B Complex contains the entire B-complex, including the activated forms of vitamin B2 (riboflavin 5'-phosphate), vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate), folic acid (L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate), and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), as well as 80 mg choline citrate. Although choline is often grouped with the B vitamin family, it is not officially a B vitamin.


Ingredients
One Capsule Contains:
Thiamin (as Thiamin HCl) 110 mg.
Riboflavin (as Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate Sodium) 10 mg.
Niacin (130 mg as Niacinamide and 10 mg as Niacin) 140 mg.
Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate) 10 mg.
Folate (as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate from L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt) 400 mcg.
Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin) 400 mcg.
Biotin 400 mcg.
Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate) 110 mg.
Choline Citrate 80 mg. 
Other Ingredients: Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Silicon Dioxide, Leucine, Magnesium Citrate. 

V16


Suggested Use
Take 1 capsule one to three times daily or as recommended by a health-care practitioner.


Warnings
ALLERGY WARNINGThis product is contraindicated in an individual with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.PREGNANCY If pregnant, consult your health-care practitioner before using this product.INTERACTIONSFolinic  acid and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate supplementation is not recommended  concurrently with methotrexate cancer therapy, as they can interfere  with methotrexate's anti-neoplastic activity; however, these folate  sources have not been shown to interfere with the anti-inflammatory  activity of methotrexate. An individual taking methotrexate for  psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis can safely take a supplement  containing folate.
