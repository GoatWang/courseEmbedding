Ultimus Launches New Distribution Advantage Program | Business Wire
























































Ultimus Launches New Distribution Advantage Program




Leveraging Years of Experience






April 11, 2017 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ultimus 
      Fund Solutions®, LLC (Ultimus®), one of the largest independent 
      providers of mutual fund, pooled investment and middle office services, 
      today announces the launch of the Distribution Advantage Program. 
      Available exclusively to clients, the Distribution Advantage Program 
      focuses on providing accurate, valuable, and timely mutual fund 
      distribution information and insights to assist asset managers in 
      determining and executing on their distribution strategy. The program 
      concentrates on three main aspects of Ultimus distribution curriculum, 
      digitizing the Ultimus Distribution Playbook into the Ultimus 
      Distribution Advantage website, creating the Ultimus Distribution 
      webinar series, and continuing the Ultimus Distribution consultation 
      business.
    


      The new Distribution Advantage website site will provide familiar 
      information, as well as new features, and allows for quicker updating 
      which provides clients with more timely information. So like the 
      Distribution Playbook, the website contains pertinent distribution 
      information for a multitude of intermediaries, including the minimum 
      channel or platform requirements. Then, to assist clients in connecting 
      to industry business partners that can help ramp up their distribution 
      and growth efforts, the site also includes a recommended listing of 
      assorted distribution resources. For the convenience of Ultimus clients 
      and to assist them with pertinent industry networking opportunities, the 
      site also contains a current web event calendar with details regarding 
      various industry conferences suited for mutual fund firms, and upcoming 
      educational Ultimus webinars.
    

      Ultimus has introduced an interactive portion to the distribution 
      program this year with regularly scheduled distribution related webinars 
      available exclusively to Ultimus clients. Each webinar will be led by 
      Ultimus Director of Distribution Strategies, Kevin 
      Guerette, a nearly 20 year industry professional. Various industry 
      experts, serving as subject matter experts, will join Guerette in the 
      webinars. A schedule of monthly webinars is available at the new 
      website. These webinars will cover distribution related topics for the 
      benefit of client’s product and distribution efforts. Topics include the 
      impact of DOL, marketing and PR best practices for mutual funds, virtual 
      wholesaling, and third party marketing.
    

      The Distribution Advantage Program centers on the legacy aspect of 
      one-on-one consultations with Guerette, who joined Ultimus in 2013 and 
      engages clients in an effort to help grow their funds. He leads the 
      Ultimus distribution team, servicing clients by facilitating the 
      establishment of relationships and negotiating agreements with brokerage 
      firms and intermediaries. Kevin and team also offer product analysis and 
      fund development advice for clients, presenting professional guidance 
      related to the appropriate fund products, investment strategies, share 
      classes, target market, performance goals and distribution options.
    

      “Enhancing this distribution program not only adds value to our client 
      services, but ultimately helps our clients reach their goals,” said Bob 
      Dorsey, CEO and Managing Director of Ultimus. “With industry trends 
      constantly evolving the new Distribution Advantage program will provide 
      a much needed resource for clients wanting to grow assets and keeping 
      them up to date with critical distribution information.”
