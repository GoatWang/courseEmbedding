The Top 10 Promotional Products






















































































OUR STORY



From humble beginnings in the basement of his home in Kettering, Ohio 45 years ago, John Howe started selling custom ring binders. That evolved into filling those binders with index tabs and printing, opening a binder manufacturing facility, and in 1987 launching a print production facility in downtown Cincinnati.  As technology rapidly advanced, growing the business beyond binders and print became imperative and John added promotional products to his expanding business.  From there John’s kids, Steve and Nancy, joined the business and learned from the bottom up, from collating manuals to answering phones to sales and accounting. Today the company continues to thrive and transform as customers’ needs continue to change. With 45 years of knowledge and experience, The John K. Howe Company is a Cincinnati success story.  We look forward to many years to come in providing our customers with top notch service, expertise and promotional product solutions.

John H. Howe, Architect
From Taliesin Apprentice to Master of Organic Design

2015 •
                                
Authors:
Jane King Hession and Tim QuigleyForeword by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer






A richly illustrated biography of John H. Howe, “the pencil in Frank Lloyd Wright’s hand” and one of Minnesota’s premier architects

A charter member of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship, John H. Howe earned a reputation as “the pencil in Wright’s hand” before establishing his own architectural practice in Minnesota. This is the first book to tell Howe’s story and also the first full account of his place in the history of modern architecture—as chief draftsman and valued interpreter of Wright’s designs and as a prolific architect in his own right.



John Howe had a remarkable career in architecture. Joining Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship at age nineteen, Howe quickly became the great architect’s chief draftsman, and he was present at the creation of some of the most famous buildings of the twentieth century. After Wright's death, Howe established his own office in Minneapolis, designing scores of elegant homes and other works in the organic manner pioneered by Wright. John H. Howe, Architect offers a thorough, beautifully illustrated account of a quiet, gentle man who left behind one of the finest bodies of modern architecture in Minnesota.
—Larry Millett, author of Minnesota’s Own: Preserving our Grand Homes and Once There Were Castles: Lost Mansions and Estates of the Twin Cities

In 1932 nineteen-year-old John H. Howe arrived at Taliesin as a charter member of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship. There he would remain for the next thirty-two years, earning a reputation as “the pencil in Wright’s hand” before establishing his own architectural practice in Minnesota.  This is the first book to tell Howe’s story and also the first full account of his place in the history of modern architecture—as chief draftsman and valued interpreter of Wright’s designs and as a prolific architect in his own right. Illustrated throughout with Howe’s sublime drawings, this biography is a testament to the underappreciated architect’s extraordinary design and rendering skills. Influenced by Wright’s principles of organic architecture, Howe operated under the conviction that “the land is the beginning of architecture.” Architectural historians Jane King Hession and Tim Quigley show how this belief worked especially well for Howe in Minnesota, where his buildings appear to have grown naturally and organically from the landscape. Also remarkable are the visionary architectural schemes Howe created while serving time in prison during World War II as a conscientious objector—futuristic visions that anticipated Eero Saarinen’s later designs for airports and Victor Gruen’s plans for America’s first indoor shopping mall.  An enlightening look at an exemplary life in architecture, this book finally brings the accomplishment—and significance—of John Howe to the fore and at the same time illuminates a fascinating chapter in American architectural history.

—Larry Millett, author of Minnesota’s Own: Preserving our Grand Homes and Once There Were Castles: Lost Mansions and Estates of the Twin Cities 


Jane King Hession and Tim Quigley have told a first-rate and engaging story. This book not only brings attention to the legacy of organic architecture as embodied in John H. Howe’s work, but also reinvigorates the discussion of creating buildings in harmony with the nature of our planet.
—Louis Wiehle, co-founder of Wiehle-Carr Architects and apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin


The book is a revelation, tracing Howe’s rise from raw teenager to superbly accomplished designer. 
— Star Tribune 


 John H. Howe: From Taliesin Apprentice to Master of Organic Architecture will make a happy addition to the libraries of architects, Wright enthusiasts and those who favor mid-century architecture and design. 
— Friends of Fallingwater 


 John H. Howe, Architect is a compelling story of Howe’s daily collaboration with Wright.
— Architecture Minnesota 


In recounting Howe’s experiences, the authors give a very good sense of the inner workings of Wright’s studio, and indeed the personality and character of America’s greatest architect.

UMP blog: Did John H. Howe design any Frank Lloyd Wright houses?
At 19 years old, the architect John H. Howe became a founding member of Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship—a group of 23 apprentices that lived with the famed architect at his estate near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Howe earned a reputation as "the pencil in Wright's hand," and as such it's no surprise that speculation has spread over whether Howe designed any structures traditionally attributed to Wright.

In 1932 nineteen-year-old John H. Howe arrived at Taliesin as a charter member of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship. There he would remain for the next thirty-two years, earning a reputation as “the pencil in Wright’s hand” before establishing his own architectural practice in Minnesota.
This is the first book to tell Howe’s story, and also the first full account of his place in the history of modern architecture—as chief draftsman and valued interpreter of Wright’s designs and as a prolific architect in his own right. Illustrated throughout with Howe’s sublime drawings, this biography is a testament to the underappreciated architect’s extraordinary design and rendering skills.
Influenced by Wright’s principles of organic architecture, Howe operated under the conviction that “the land is the beginning of architecture.” Architectural historians Jane King Hession and Tim Quigley show how this belief worked especially well for Howe in Minnesota, where his buildings appear to have grown naturally and organically from the landscape. Also remarkable are the visionary architectural schemes Howe created while serving time in prison during World War II as a conscientious objector—futuristic visions that anticipated Eero Saarinen’s later designs for airports and Victor Gruen’s plans for America’s first indoor shopping mall.
An enlightening look at an exemplary life in architecture, this book finally brings the accomplishment—and significance—of John Howe to the fore and at the same time illuminates a fascinating chapter in American architectural history.
 


Authors: Jane King Hession and Tim Quigley. Foreword by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer
