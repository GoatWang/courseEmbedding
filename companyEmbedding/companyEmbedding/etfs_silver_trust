Important Information

 

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read it carefully before investing.


iShares Silver Trust (the “Silver Trust”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents the Silver Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iShares.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Silver Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-474-2737. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Because shares of the Trust are intended to reflect the price of the silver held by the Trust, the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting silver prices. Additionally, shares of the Trust are bought and sold at market price, not at net asset value ("NAV"). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Shares of the Trust are intended to reflect, at any given time, the market price of silver owned by the Trust at that time less the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The price received upon the sale of shares of the Trust, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the silver represented by such shares. If an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares. For a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the Trust, carefully read the prospectus. Following an investment in the Trust, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of silver and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares. Among them: (i) A change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of silver. Silver is used in a wide range of industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price and the price of the shares. (ii) A significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards silver. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards silver, a decline in world silver prices could occur, negatively impacting the price of the shares. (iii) A significant increase in silver price hedging activity by silver producers. Traditionally, silver producers have not hedged to the same extent as other producers of precious metals (gold, for example) do. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of silver producing companies, it could cause a decline in world silver prices, adversely affecting the price of the shares. Silver Spot Prices provided by The Bullion Desk. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades. Although shares of the Trust may be bought or sold on the secondary market through any brokerage account, shares are not redeemable except in large aggregated units called "Baskets". Only registered broker-dealers that become authorized participants by entering into a contract with the sponsor and the trustee of the Trust may purchase or redeem Baskets. The amount of silver represented by shares of the Trust will decrease over the life of the Trust due to sales of silver necessary to pay the sponsor's fee and Trust expenses. Without increases in the price of silver sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the shares will also decline, and investors will lose money on their investment in the shares. The Trust will have limited duration. The liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trust's silver will result in losses to investors. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of Trust shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. There is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares, which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares. The value of the shares of the Trust will be adversely affected if silver owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the Trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss. Shares of the Trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by BlackRock, Inc., and its affiliates. An investment in the Trust is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. When comparing commodities and the Trust, it should be remembered that the sponsor's fee associated with the Trust is not borne by investors in individual commodities. Buying and selling shares of the Trust will result in brokerage commissions. Because the expenses involved in an investment in physical silver will be dispersed among all holders of shares of the Trust, an investment in the Trust may represent a cost-efficient alternative to investments in silver for investors not otherwise able to participate directly in the market for physical silver. Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined as specified in the prospectus: the iShares Silver Trust's silver and other assets are valued on the basis of each day's announced LBMA Silver Price, the price of an ounce of silver based on electronic, auction-based platform from CME Group and Thomson Reuters, minus all accrued fees, expenses and liabilities.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

Silver exchange-traded product

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Silver exchange-traded products are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and closed-end funds (CEFs) that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges. The U.S Geological Survey cites the emergence of silver ETFs as a significant factor in the 2007-2011 price rise of silver. As of September 2011, the largest of these funds holds the equivalent of over one third of the world's total annual silver production.

Products[edit]
Physically backed funds[edit]

Central Fund of Canada (TSX: CEF.NV.A, NYSE MKT: CEF) and Silver Bullion Trust (TSX: SBT.UN, SBT.U) are closed-end funds created by the same Canadian founders and mandated to keep the bulk of their net assets in precious metals, with a small percentage of cash. The Central Fund of Canada holds a mix of gold and silver, while the Silver Bullion Trust holds only silver. The Central Fund of Canada and Silver Bullion Trust initial public offerings were completed in 1961 and 2009 respectively.[1][2]
iShares Silver Trust (NYSE Arca: SLV) was launched by iShares in April 2006. As of November 2010, iShares Silver Trust is the largest silver ETF on the market with over 335 million troy ounces of silver in storage.[3]
ETFS Physical Silver (LSE: PHAG, PHSP) was launched by ETF Securities in April 2007 and is backed by allocated silver bullion.[4] ETF Securities have since launched physical silver ETFs on multiple exchanges around the world including Paris (Euronext: PHAG), Australia (ASX: ETP), New York (NYSE Arca: SIVR) and Tokyo (TYO: 1673). ETFS Physical Silver is backed by allocated bullion in the form of LBMA bars held with a custodian, HSBC Bank USA, and audited twice a year by an independent third party, Inspectorate International Ltd.[5][6]
ZKB Silver ETF (SIX: ZSIL, ZSILEU, ZSILUS) was launched by Zürcher Kantonalbank in May 2007 and invests exclusively in physical silver.[7]
Claymore Silver Bullion Trust (TSX: SVR.UN) is a closed-end fund created by Claymore Investments. The initial public offering was completed on July 15, 2009.[8]
Julius Baer Physical Silver Fund (SIX: JBSICA, JBSIEA, JBSIUA, JBSIGA) was launched by Swiss & Global Asset Management (formerly Julius Baer Asset Management) in January 2010.[9]
Sprott Physical Silver Trust (NYSE Arca: PSLV, TSX: PHS.U) is a closed-end fund created by Sprott Asset Management. The initial public offering was completed on November 3, 2010.[10]

Other products[edit]

BOOST Silver 3X Leverage Daily (LSE: 3SIL) Boost Silver 3X Short Daily (LSE: 3SIS)

Boost provides a range of 3x commodity and equity short and leveraged ETFs. In Silver as well as Gold Boost offers 3x leveraged and short versions listed on the London Stock Exchange. The products are fully collateralized and have multiple market makers who will offer deep and liquid markets. GBP quoted versions also exist.

PureFunds ISE Junior Silver (Small Cap Miners/Explorers) (NYSE Arca: SILJ) was launched in November, 2012, and is designed to track the performance of the ISE Junior Silver Index, less investor fees.
ETFS Silver (LSE: SLVR) was launched by ETF Securities in September 2006 and tracks the DJ-UBS Silver Sub-Index
db Physical Silver ETC (SIX: XSIL, LSE: XSIL, FWB: XAD6) was launched by Deutsche Bank in July 2010.[11][12]
PowerShares DB Silver (NYSE Arca: DBS), an ETF which holds primarily futures contracts for physical delivery, which are later sold to silver consumers in order to roll over expiring contracts to contracts further from expiration. ProShares Ultra Silver (NYSE Arca: AGQ), seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to twice (200%) the daily performance of silver bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar fixing price for delivery in London. ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE Arca: ZSL) in the corresponding 2x inverse ETF.
UBS E-TRACS CMCI Silver Total Return (NYSE Arca: USV and LSE: SILG) is designed to track the performance of the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Silver Total Return, less investor fees.
Horizons BetaPro COMEX Silver ETF (TSX: HUZ) aims to correspond to the performance of the COMEX silver futures contract for a subsequent delivery month.

Risks[edit]
Each silver ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Such instruments do not necessarily hold physical silver. For example, silver ETNs generally track the price of silver using derivatives. All exchange-traded silver instruments, including those that hold physical silver for the benefit of the investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. The most popular silver ETF (iShares Silver Trust, symbol SLV) has been compared with mortgage-backed securities due to its complexity.[13]

UBS E-TRACS CMCI Silver Total Return (NYSE Arca: USV and LSE: SILG) is designed to track the performance of the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Silver Total Return, less investor fees.
Horizons BetaPro COMEX Silver ETF (TSX: HUZ) aims to correspond to the performance of the COMEX silver futures contract for a subsequent delivery month.

Risks[edit]
Each silver ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Such instruments do not necessarily hold physical silver. For example, silver ETNs generally track the price of silver using derivatives. All exchange-traded silver instruments, including those that hold physical silver for the benefit of the investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. The most popular silver ETF (iShares Silver Trust, symbol SLV) has been compared with mortgage-backed securities due to its complexity.[13]

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

iShares Silver Trust (ETF)(NYSE:SLV): Peak Silver Production Seen | ETF Daily News

































 






























































Peak Silver Production Could Be The Next Big Bullish Catalyst (SLV)


 July 10, 2017 6:24am  NYSE:SLV  



 




From Tyler Durden: Whilst a lot of precious metals investors are solely focusing on gold, we would almost forget about silver, also called ‘the poor man’s gold’ although things are changing fast on this market as well.




2016 was the first year in more than a decade wherein the primary silver production (coming from mines either as a main product or a by-product credit) decreased. After seeing a total silver production of approximately 668 million ounces in 2007 increasing to 891 million ounces in 2015, we saw a (first) decrease to 886 million ounces in 2016.

Source: The Silver Institute
As you can see on the previous image, the total recovery from scrap and the inflow from hedges decreased as well, causing the total silver supply to decrease by approximately 3% to 1.007 billion ounces, the lowest level since 2013.
Whilst the total demand for silver also decreased to 1.028 billion ounces, 2016 was the fourth consecutive year with a supply deficit. Sure, the deficit was just 21 million ounces, but that’s entirely due to the lower demanf for jewelry and investment purposes. As you can clearly see in the same table, the demand from those two end-uses was 519 million ounces in 2015, but fell to just 414 million ounces in 2016, a decrease of 105 million ounces.

Source: Ibidem
One of the arguments of bears is the decreasing use of the precious metal in the photographic sector. It’s absolutely impossible to deny that, but it’s also already clearly visible in the trend since 2007. In 2007 the silver demand for the photographic sector was 117 million ounces 12.32% of the total world demand, but last year, the sector needed just 45 million ounces of silver, which is now just over 4% of the total world demand.
This means that even if the demand for photographic uses would drop to zero (which isn’t impossible, although the sector demand has remained relatively stable since 2013), this would most definitely NOT cause a shift of the demand curve. One main contributor to the steady demand would be the increased use of the photovoltaic sector, where the silver demand reached its highest point éver.
So the supply side of silver isn’t really slowing down (yes, the total demand was lower due to lower demand for investment uses), but the silver demand from industrial sectors is still at an elevated level.

Source: Ibidem
This also means the supply side will have to (try to) keep up with the demand. According to the Silver Institute, only 30% of the mine supply is coming from mines which have the commodity as a primary product. 12% comes from primary gold mines, whilst an additional 23% is mined as part of primary copper deposit. With the current low gold and copper price, not a lot of new mines will be developed which will put pressure on the supply side of the equation.
Fortunately 35% of the mine supply came from lead-zinc mines, and as these two commodities are performing well, it’s not unlikely more lead and zinc mines will be brought into production, boosting the silver output in the process. That being said, several larger zinc mines have been shut down and are still shutting down, and it looks like the average grade of the precious metal as a by-product in the ‘advanced stage’ zinc mines is dropping, perhaps even to a level where smelters don’t deem the silver to be payable due to low recovery rates in the process.
Long story short: the demand for silver is there ‘to stay’, but will the supply side be able to keep up with the demand? Scrap supply seems to have peaked, whilst it won’t be easy to increase the mine supply.
The iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE:SLV) fell $0.29 (-1.97%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, SLV has declined -2.51%, versus a 8.31% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
SLV currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #9 of 35 ETFs in the Precious Metals ETFs category.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
