Product Description▼▲
Hermeneutical theory has been extensively expanded, refined, and rethought over the last three decades - leading to both confusion and conflict over how contemporary evangelicals should read, interpret, and apply Scripture.  Dr. Thomas compares, contrasts, and clarifies the basic characteristics of and developing conflicts between traditional evangelical hermeneutics and newer theories that place one's "preunderstanding" at the beginning of the interpretive process. This accomplished and acclaimed scholar evaluates how some newer methods may open the door to unorthodox - and potentially spurious - interpretations of Scripture's core teachings.

            Thomas picks off where the likes of Ramm left off in his Protestant Biblical Hermeneutics, continuing to shed light on other systems of Hermeneutics while further defining the grammatical-historical method (which these days can even mean the opposite of what is traditionally meant by this system of hermeneutics). Thomas points this out and more, beginning with the woes of a post Kantian 'Hermeneutic' so focused on preunderstanding, and then the actual results of interpreting through such a lens later in the book. I'm sure many will disagree with Thomas as he does expose the errors in many camps (dynamic equivalence, open theism, theonomy, and more), so if you do, be sure to heed the authors advice that he gives throughout much of the book and consider the grammatical-historical method and it's foundational principles!

            Great book; a must have for all who are teachers of the Scriptures. Mr. Thomas corrects many mistakes in the Hermeneutical process.

            Dr. Robert L. Thomas, professor of NT at The Master's Seminary in Sun Valley, California, has written a much needed work on biblical hermeneutics. He has done a great service to the evangelical community by drawing our attention to unwarranted (and perhaps hermeneutically poisonous) changes in evangelical hermeneutics. Overall, Dr. Thomas' cautions and concerns are legitimate, and the student/scholar should heed his warnings.  The only area of weakness in Dr. Thomas' treatment lies in his chapters on "Dynamic Equivalence" (Chapter 4) and "Modern Linquistics" (Chapter 8).  Here, Dr. Thomas relies too much on Milton S. Terry's tome on biblical interpretation (written in 1885) failing to (cautiously) appreciate the modern advances in linguistics, communications theory, lexicography, et al.  Despite these criticisms I hightly recommend Dr. Thomas' work, which should be seriously consulted by every student/scholar who desires to faithfully interpret the word of God.  Along with Dr. Thomas' work, the student/scholar should digest the works of M. S. Terry, B. Ramm, E. Johnson, and R. Zuck.

About us

by Robert Thomas



Here are a few snoring mouthpieces that I have personally tested
If you have been searching for anti-snoring mouthpieces, you probably figured out that the internet is fairly congested with sales pitches coming from various companies who all claim to have the best product on the market and “guarantee your satisfaction”. Sifting through all of this information can literally take hours, leaving you with more questions than answers.
Hello, my name is Bob, and snoring is a subject that is near and dear to me. Not only do I snore but so does my wife. It is often a race between us to fall asleep first so we are not kept up by each others snoring. Once asleep, we often wake one another with a suggestive nudge and a request to roll over. After years and countless hours of restlessness, I decided to take action.
With various products available on the market, the first decision was to choose which type of product was right for my wife and I. There were throat sprays, nasal strips, nasal cones, herbal supplements, snore pillows, chin straps, and even a ring that you wear on your finger! Then I discovered mouth guards. This seemed to be more of a viable long-term solution. Once this decision was made, I quickly became overwhelmed by the sheer number similar products that were available. I  literally spent weeks doing research, sifting through pages upon pages of information and finally analyzing the results that I found. From this information I created a snoring mouthpiece comparison chart. If your interested, you can read the full story of how I discovered these amazing devices here.
Snoring Mouthpiece Guide was designed with the end consumer in mind. It is my genuine interest to provide you with unbiased product information to assist you while making a decision. When appropriate, I use a multidimensional approach to create reviews. You will receive honest feedback and an unbiased recommendation formed from countless hours of my research.
It is my sincere hope that you take this information, learn from it and apply the information that you find to make an informed buying decision.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe New Worlds Of Thomas Robert Malthus: Rereading The Principle Of Populationby Bashford, Alison/ Chaplin, Joyce E.The New Worlds of Thomas Robert Malthus is a sweeping global and intellectual history that radically recasts our understanding of Malthus'sEssay on the Principle of Population, the most famous book on population ever written or ever likely to be. Malthus'sEssay is also persistently misunderstood. First published anonymously in 1798, theEssay systematically argues that population growth tends to outpace its means of subsistence unless kept in check by factors such as disease, famine, or war, or else by lowering the birth rate through such means as sexual abstinence.Challenging the widely held notion that Malthus's Essay was a product of the British and European context in which it was written, Alison Bashford and Joyce Chaplin demonstrate that it was the new world, as well as the old, that fundamentally shaped Malthus's ideas. They explore what the Atlantic and Pacific new worlds--from the Americas and the Caribbean to New Zealand and Tahiti--meant to Malthus, and how he treated them in hisEssay. Bashford and Chaplin reveal how Malthus, long vilified as the scourge of the English poor, drew from his principle of population to conclude that the extermination of native populations by European settlers was unjust.Elegantly written and forcefully argued, The New Worlds of Thomas Robert Malthus relocates Malthus'sEssay from the British economic and social context that has dominated its reputation to the colonial and global history that inspired its genesis.World, DemographyCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Description

Young Robert Jermain Thomas is a promising Welsh minister with a gift for new languages. For Robert, there is no doubt God wants him to use his abilities to bring the Gospel of Jesus to the Far East. But when he suffers tragedy in China, Robert loses direction and hope. That is, until he meets two Christian fishermen from the "Hermit Kingdom" of Korea who want to know more. Though Christianity is illegal and Westerners forbidden, Robert has a new mission: to bring the Word of God to the Korean people, no matter the cost. What will Robert have to sacrifice to share God's Word with Korea?
