About

Amethyst Corporation is a full-cycle solutions provider for tomorrow’s networked world.  With offerings across the brain – machine space, Amethyst both manufactures the wearables and engineers the software necessary to connect minds to matter.
Started with the challenge of redefining teamwork for the 21st century, CEO Murat Lehia began with a simple precept: that written and spoken language has been optimized, but that more effective technologies exist for communication.  Maximizing team productivity through neural networking defines the new competitive advantage.  Amethyst’s products literally offer it customers the ability to see and feel what each-other feel, promoting highly authentic communication that turns a team from a group of individuals into a single concerted unit.
With frontrunning expertise in understanding the human brain as a connectivity portal, Amethyst is the global leader in bringing the human element into the Internet of Things.  For team solutions, its removable headsets enable temporary and secure access to shared communication environments in which networked members have access to the cognitive abilities of others, essentially connecting all team member’s minds to a collective cognitive computing cloud.
In his TEDy talk, Murat proclaimed “The 20th century was about silicon and software.  The 21st is about the mind and body as networkable technology.  The horizon is boundless, and Amethyst is the first boat out of port.  I’m proud of what we’ve done so far, but our plans are much, much grander.”

Envision and AMSURG Announce Pricing of $550 Million Senior Notes Offering by New Amethyst Corp.
November 16, 2016
 


 

Greenwood Village, Colorado & Nashville, Tennessee (November 16, 2016) – In connection with the proposed merger of Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EVHC, “Envision”) and AMSURG Corp. (NASDAQ: AMSG, “AMSURG”) (the “Merger”), Envision and AMSURG today announced that New Amethyst Corp., to be renamed Envision Healthcare Corporation (the “Company”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMSURG that will survive the Merger, has priced the private offering of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The offering is expected to close on December 1, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. If the closing of the Notes occurs prior to the date of the completion of the Merger, the proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be deposited into an escrow account pending the consummation of the Merger.
 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings of $3.495 billion expected to be made under a new term loan facility to be entered into by Envision Healthcare Corporation (“EHC”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Envision, (i) to repay EHC’s existing indebtedness under its term loan and asset-based facilities, (ii) to purchase or redeem AMSURG’s 5.625% senior notes due 2020, (iii) to repay AMSURG’s existing indebtedness under its term loan and revolving loan facilities, (iv) to pay transaction fees and expenses and (v) for working capital. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company will assume the obligations of EHC under the new term loan facility, and the Notes will be guaranteed by the Company’s domestic subsidiaries that will guarantee the new term loan facility.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes (and the guarantees) or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Notes (or any guarantees) or any other securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The Notes (and the guarantees) will be offered and sold in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  None of the Notes and such guarantees have been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and the Notes (and such guarantees) may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable state or other jurisdiction. There can be no assurance that the proposed offering of Notes will be completed. This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to the offering of the Notes and the related refinancing transactions, and the completion of the Merger, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” or “predicts,” or the negative of these words or phrases or similar words or phrases, which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. While forward-looking statements reflect Envision’s and AMSURG’s good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance. Furthermore, Envision and AMSURG disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. These forward-looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that may not be realized and that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties as well as risks and uncertainties referenced from time to time in Envision’s and AMSURG’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

About Us
Ereada Corp is an American company based in Avon, Connecticut.
Our company is the designer and creator of Ereada™ Far-Infrared Amethyst Mats and other luxury health enhancing products from Amethyst crystals.
 We carry three exclusive product lines of Ereada™ Far Infrared Amethyst Mats: 

Multifunctional Purple Mats with extra VLF PEMF ( Magnetic Therapy modules ) and 660 nm Red Light ( Bio Photon function )


Classic Brown Mats with two windows design and extra silver fiber layer for N.P. ( Negative Potential Therapy )

Ereada™ Gemstone Mats coming in July 2017 with a blend of natural gems and bio ceramic sphere, PEMF in bigger mats and for the fist time N.P. function is installed into the mini mat.
Here you can download Ereada™ newest Catalog in pdf format.
What distinguishes us and makes unique?

Unlike other companies we are experts especially in the Amethyst products.
Besides electric infrared mats and heating pads we carry also a full line of more natural, green or non powered infrared Amethyst pads available only from our company.
Our prices of course. We offer FIR Amethyst mats directly to the customers at our Ereada.com, Amazon and Ebay stores, not through MLM or distribution channels to avoid middleman margins.
Ereada Mats include the free waterproof protector covers with 3-D pads to protect your mat and make your sessions or sleeping more comfortable
You have always fast and direct email access to CEO level customer service to resolve all issues in short and no hassle way.

What makes us same or better then other companies offering infrared heating pads with natural stones?

Our mats come from FDA registered factories in Korea. Their cost is much more expensive then that of the other brands. Different U.S. companies generally outsource manufacturers for their brands within the Chinese factories abroad. We chose our contract manufacturers in Korea comparing qualities, not prices.
Our products are traceable. You always know the manufacturer and each item has the serial number. We do not hide anything from our customers. 
The high price of Infrared Amethyst mats and other products from this wonderful gem was the main challenge. We created our business to make Amethyst products affordable to more people.
Family owned business structure, own brand manufacturing and direct online sales to customers allow us to keep low operation expenses and provide our clients with the highest quality long life products at the best prices in the market.

Our history is simple. We started as users ourselves and highly appreciated the benefits of healing power of precious natural stones and heating therapy.
We also noted some design shortage, technical faults and especially the excessive prices for Amethyst mats available in the market as well as some shady selling practices.
The strong wish to make these products more convenient and affordable to share our positive experience with our relatives, friends and all other people of the same holistic beliefs encouraged us to start this business.
We treat us and our customers as members of the same society and have strong ethical principles of honest dealing and open business model. We share all our knowledge and information for the benefit of all people with health needs.
Ereada electric-powered amethyst mats and heating pads are marketed as Purple and Brown Ereada™ FIR Amethyst Mats, Ereada™ FIR Amethyst Belts and non-powered Ereada™ FIR Amethyst Pillows.
Our old collections of artisan hand made by BEAM POWER Korea traditional non-powered Amethyst Beam Power™ mats, carpets, waist belts, pet mats, seat cushions, pillow cases, shoe insoles are ultra thin and ultra light non-powered amethyst pads of different size and usage are not available at the moment, but we still hope to have them back soon same as MediCrystal brand FIR Amethyst Mats manufactured in China.
Ereada™ Amethyst Mats are made in Korea by GMP, ISO, CE, FDA and Korean Food and Drug Administration registered medical device manufacturing facility of Hyundai Medical Co., Ltd with more then 15 years of manufacturing experience exclusively for Ereada Corp.
The products are covered with easy refund policy, usually we refund you the full purchase price but you will be responsible for the return shipping. If you got a wrong or effective item by our error, we will cover return shipping as well.
We also provide one year warranty from the date of purchase. It is transferable if you get a gift or buy our products from the original owner.
Replacement parts for standard wear and tear are always available for prompt delivery.
All urgent and important questions regarding the Ereada™ Amethyst Mat use or maintenance, warranty issues or return authorisation should be directed to Ereada Corp CEO by email ereada@ereada.com
We are willing to help you and will reply within 24 hours. You may also contact our customer service by the toll free phone: (800) 688-7780.

Welcome to Ereada Far Infrared Amethyst Mat store

Amethyst Mini Pillow ( non-powered )


Both our products lines combine the healing benefits of the major natural elements of the Earth and Sun: Light, Crystal, Mountains, Air and Water.  
SUN LIGHT AND CRYSTAL HEALING POWER
The most important parts of the Sun Light spectrum are the deep penetrating into the body far and medium infrared rays amplified and geometrically structured in the Ereada mat through release of Amethyst Crystal healing power absorbed during millions of years from the Earth and minerals. This bio-resonance characteristic can be explained by an example of touching a large bell with a single finger. A bell has an inherent number of vibrations when it is touched or struck. When the bell is struck at a regular interval, it causes vibrations and it begins to move. When the energy used to activate the bell is increased, the vibrations between molecules strengthens and the electronic energy increases.
MOUNTAIN AIR AND WATER HEALING POWER
The healthy elements of Mountain Air and Water are Negative Ions delivered by the bio-mat and amethyst beam products directly to the body through the skin surface. Anion emission which is called airborne vitamin not only harmonizes the physical regulatory ability but also strengthens the immune system  and protects from the electronic and environmental positive ions pollution.
Ereada amethyst products:


are ideal for beautification, weight loss, relaxation and health care
help to fight sickness and disease*
protect from bed mites, mold and bacteria growth
have luxury pattern and high-end elegance embroidery design
are built from the highest quality materials with great attention to details, they are pieces of art


Ereada products may revitalize your cells to increase blood circulation, relieve neuralgia*, backaches*, arthritis*, pains* as well as promote perspiration, eliminate toxins and improve general wellbeing and workout results.
They may be effective for fat loss, anti-aging, improving metabolism, protecting people from various kinds of adult disease* such as chronic fatigue*.
Amethyst health enhancement products are also helpful in promoting deep sleep. They are good for natural relaxation, perform an antibacterial function and purify the air. 
You can read more about the health benefits of amethyst products here.
Amethyst products are also believed to block the harmful effects of evil water vein electromagnetic waves causing insomnia, dreaminess, difficulty in waking up, weakness in the body, frequently encountered neuralgia and rheumatism as well as a lack of mental concentration for both human and pets.
Risk Free Trial, Warranty and Return policy
The products are covered with easy refund policy, usually we refund you the full purchase price but you will be responsible for the return shipping.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Amethyst
Amethyst is a variety of crystalline quartz in colors ranging from pale lilac to deep reddish purple and ranging from transparent to translucent is known as amethyst. Green amethyst is known as prasiolite, and is produced by heat treatment. Value per carat in violet purple amethyst, unlike many gems, doesn't rise exponentially with weight as it is readily available in large sizes; but depends almost entirely on color. "Siberian" deep purple amethyst with red and blue flashes commands the highest prices. Purple amethyst is indeed one of the most classic gemstone types frequently used in gemstone rings. Amethyst is also very well suited for all other types of gemstone jewelry too, including gemstone earrings, pins and brooches, as well as in necklaces and fashionable gemstone pendants.
