Company IntroServicesKey ContactsAbout CompanyWe develop and license proprietary technologies focused primarily on recycling precious metals ("PM") from scrap materials and industrial by-products. Our technologies are cheaper, faster, and greener than the conventional PM recovery methods we seek to replace. Our goal is to build a robust portfolio of royalty-generating licenses by providing superior PM recycling technologies for a wide range of materials across multiple industries. We are headquartered in Amesbury, Massachusetts with a state-of-the-art laboratory in Laval, Quebec.We currently market developed, patent pending technologies: (i) "PM1" and "PM2" to recycle precious metals from a wide range of base metal substrates, (ii) "TF1" to recover integrated circuits ("chips") from populated circuit boards, and (iii) "PbL1/PbL2" to recycle lead and glass from cathode ray tubes ("CRT"s) found in old TVs and computer monitors.Greene Lyon’s LaboratoryOur laboratory in Laval, Quebec (Montreal) has 2,800 square feet of research and office space and is located in a building devoted exclusively to R&D on the campus of INRS-IAF Research Institute. INRS is one of Canada's top universities in terms of research intensity. Our neighbors include R&D facilities of some of the world's most significant pharmaceutical and chemical companies, e.g., GSK, Sanofi, Merck, Roche, and Novartis. Our lab is currently equipped with advanced research and analytical equipment, including a Spectroscout XRF analyzer and a Spectro ARCOS EOP ICP (inductively coupled plasma) analyzer that we use for measuring the precious metal content of solids and liquids. We also have available to us a Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope TM3000, a Retsch planetary ball mill, and a Retsch SM300 grinder. We are planning to acquire additional specialized equipment and lab technicians in 2015 to expand and accelerate our R&D activities.Greene Lyon Canada, Inc.500 boul.

Basel Action Network 
BAN is the world's only organization focused on confronting the global environmental injustice and economic inefficiency of toxic trade (toxic wastes, products and technologies) and its devastating impacts. Working at the nexus of human rights and environment, we confront the issues of environmental justice at a macro level, preventing disproportionate and unsustainable dumping of the world's toxic waste and pollution on our global village's poorest residents. At the same time we actively promote the sustainable and just solutions to our consumption and waste crises — banning waste trade, while promoting green, toxic free and democratic design of consumer products. 



Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries 
ISRI, a Washington, DC, based trade association, represents more than 1,600 for-profit companies – ranging from small, family-owned businesses to large, multi-national corporations -- operating at more than 6,000 facilities in the United States and 30 countries worldwide. Our members are manufacturers and processors, brokers and industrial consumers of scrap commodities, including ferrous and nonferrous metals, paper, electronics, rubber, plastics, glass and textiles. ISRI's associate members include equipment and service providers to the scrap recycling industry. Manufacturers and sellers of equipment and services—such as shredders, balers, cranes, cargo transporters, computer systems and more—find value in promoting the scrap recycling industry through their membership in ISRI. 



No Dirty Gold 
A wedding band, or some other piece of gold jewelry-for many people, these things are almost too valuable to put a price on. Perhaps you own such a ring yourself. But while the ring as a symbol may indeed be priceless, the gold certainly is not. Gold comes with a price-a heavy one. Gold is costing the planet and its peoples far more than the metal itself is worth.
The production of one gold ring generates 20 tons of wastes. 



E-Scrap News 
E-Scrap News has provided both newcomers and veterans in the electronics recycling industry independent and experienced coverage electronics recycling issues for the past decade. Each issue of the quarterly magazine features the latest industry, market, and legislative news, directories of responsible e-scrap operators and in-depth features written by the leaders of the industry. E-Scrap News is the definitive source for marketing new equipment and services, contacting buyers and sellers, and keeping up to speed on the latest developments in this fast-paced environment. The fall issue of the magazine is also distributed at the annual E-Scrap Conference, North America's premier electronics recycling conference and tradeshow. 



Recycling Today 
The recycling of obsolete and discarded materials is nearly as old as humankind itself. While the Recycling Today Media Group (RTMG) does not go back quite that far, our commitment to the recycling industry dates back to 1963 when Recycling Today was founded as Secondary Raw Materials magazine. Since that time, we have been publishing an increasingly comprehensive trade magazine and have branched out to become much more than just one magazine.

						Dr. Svitlana Moskovchenko Speaks at International Environmental Forum					



Dr. Svitlana MoskovchenkoDr. Svitlana Moskovchenko, Greene Lyon Group CTO, spoke March 21 at Americana 2013 in Montreal, a biannual global conference of environmental experts. Lana's topic was "Recovery of Precious Metals from Waste Printed Circuit Boards – History and Recent Developments".






						Unwanted Electronic Waste is on The Rise					


In this age of exploding consumer demand for the best and newest electronic everything, it should be no surprise that we are generating outdated and unwanted electronic devices in unprecedented numbers. The electronics recycling industry has compiled data showing that the volume of e-waste has more than doubled in the past five years and that e-waste is the fastest growing waste stream.
Some e-waste offers an opportunity to recover raw materials to make new products. But some is simply a problem, which, if not managed properly, poses an environmental hazard. Case in point – leaded glass in the cathode ray tubes (CRTs) found in old TVs and computer monitors. Because CRTs have been replaced by new flat panel displays, the legitimate uses for CRT glass are rapidly diminishing. As a result, as noted in a recent New York Times article "roughly 660 million pounds of the glass is being stored in warehouses across the country, and it will cost $85 million to $360 million to responsibly recycle it...".

				Greene Lyon’s Laboratory			


Our laboratory in Laval, Quebec (Montreal) has 2,800 square feet of research and office space and is located in a building devoted exclusively to R&D on the campus of INRS-IAF Research Institute. INRS is one of Canada's top universities in terms of research intensity. Our neighbors include R&D facilities of some of the world's most significant pharmaceutical and chemical companies, e.g., GSK, Sanofi, Merck, Roche, and Novartis. Our lab is currently equipped with advanced research and analytical equipment, including a Spectroscout XRF analyzer and a Spectro ARCOS EOP ICP (inductively coupled plasma) analyzer that we use for measuring the precious metal content of solids and liquids. We also have available to us a Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope TM3000, a Retsch planetary ball mill, and a Retsch SM300 grinder. We are planning to acquire additional specialized equipment and lab technicians in 2015 to expand and accelerate our R&D activities.

HomeAbout Us















						Greene Lyon Group					


We develop and commercialize proprietary technologies focused primarily on recycling gold, silver, and other precious metals ("PM") from scrap materials and industrial by-products. Our technologies are cheaper, faster, and more sustainable than the conventional PM recovery methods they replace. Our goal is to build a robust portfolio of superior PM recycling technologies for a wide range of materials across multiple industries. We are headquartered in Beverly, Massachusetts with an R&D laboratory in Laval, Quebec.
We currently market a suite of patent pending technologies to recycle PM plated on base metal substrates. These technologies, which we refer to collectively as “PM-STRIP™”, are chemical or electrochemical in various applications and include “S-PURE™“ for the recovery of pure silver metal from solution.
We also offer two technologies not directed to PM recovery (i) "TF1" to recover integrated circuits ("chips") from populated circuit boards, and (ii) "PbL2" to recycle lead and glass from cathode ray tubes ("CRT"s) found in old TVs and computer monitors.
