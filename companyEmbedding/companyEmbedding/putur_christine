NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH, SEHK: 6388), a leading marketer of modern 
      classic American accessories, today announced the appointment of 
      Christine Putur as Executive Vice President and Chief Information 
      Officer, effective January 22, 2013.
    


      Ms. Putur joins Coach from Staples, Inc., where she was Senior Vice 
      President and Chief Information Officer. In her role, Ms. Putur was 
      responsible for IT strategy and implementation globally for the company. 
      Over a 12-year period, Ms. Putur held successively senior IT roles 
      within the Staples organization covering ecommerce, strategy, retail, 
      supply chain and global corporate functions. Before Staples, she was 
      with Compaq Computer Corporation. She has a BA in Administrative 
      Science/Math from Colby College and an MS in Management Information 
      Systems from Boston University.
    

      “Chris brings 25 years of broad-based and relevant IT experience to 
      Coach. Her expertise and strong operational track record make her a 
      valuable addition to the Coach management team,” said Jerry Stritzke, 
      President and Chief Operating Officer of Coach, Inc. “At Coach, she will 
      set our IS strategy and oversee the operation details of service 
      delivery, addressing the needs of our rapidly growing global business.”
    

      “I am excited to join Coach as it positions for continued growth. Coach 
      is an exceptional company and brand with a keen focus on leveraging the 
      power of the digital world. I look forward to joining the organization 
      and contributing to its continued strength and momentum,” said Ms. Putur.
    

      Ms. Putur succeeds Tom Britt, who announced his departure from Coach 
      last year. “Tom has played an important role in building critical IS 
      capabilities and developing the talent to support our growth during his 
      tenure with the company,” added Mr. Stritzke. “We wish him every success 
      in the future and look forward to welcoming Chris.”

Mar 19, 2014, 16:30 ET
		  		  								
						 from   Information Services Group 











 
















































 

 




















 


STAMFORD, Conn., March 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Information Services Group (ISG) (NASDAQ:   III), a leading technology insights, market intelligence and advisory services company, today named Christine Putur, executive vice president and chief information officer of Coach, Inc. (NYSE:   COH, SEHK: 6388), to its board of directors.
In addition to naming Putur to its board, ISG also announced that Robert E. Weissman, lead independent director and an original member of the company's board, will retire as of March 19, 2014, and Gerald S. Hobbs, a current board member, will replace Weissman as the board's lead independent director. 
Putur has been CIO at Coach, a leading New York design house of modern luxury accessories, since January 2013.  She joined the company from Staples, Inc., where she was senior vice president and chief information officer after serving in other senior IT roles over a 13-year career with the office supply retailer.  Prior to Staples, she was with Compaq Computer Corporation.  She has a BA in Administrative Science/Math from Colby College and an MS in Management Information Systems from Boston University.
"We are delighted to welcome Chris to the ISG board of directors," said Michael P. Connors, chairman and chief executive officer of ISG.  "She is an outstanding business leader who brings to our board deep experience in information technology and a fresh perspective on our business from a client's point of view.  Her expertise and insights will be extremely valuable as we enter our next stage of growth as a leading information-based services company.
"At the same time, I want to pay a special tribute to Bob Weissman, an original member of the ISG board who has been a guiding hand and a tremendous inspiration to all of us since the earliest days of ISG," said Connors.  "We are indebted to Bob for his many contributions and years of dedicated service to the board and company.  His leadership, experience and wise counsel have been invaluable in helping make ISG the success it is today."
An executive with extensive experience in the information services sector, Weissman joined the ISG board in August 2006, prior to the company's initial public offering in February 2007.  He is the former chairman and CEO of IMS Health Inc., Cognizant Corporation and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.  In addition to ISG, he has served on the boards of State Street Corporation and Pitney Bowes, Inc.  He is a current member of the board of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation.
"Even though we will miss Bob's personal involvement with ISG, we are very fortunate to have, in Jerry Hobbs, an equally talented and experienced board member to assume the role of lead independent director," said Connors.  "We look forward to Jerry's continued contributions and sage advice in helping us build an even stronger and larger company in the years ahead."
Hobbs is a managing director and operating partner at Boston Ventures, a leading private-equity firm.  He joined the ISG board in 2008.
The ISG board of directors consists of six members, and with the exception of Connors, all are independent directors.  In addition to Connors, Hobbs and Putur, the other members of the ISG board are Neil G. Budnick, Kalpana Raina, and Donald C. Waite III.  To view detailed biographies of each board member, visit http://www.isg-one.com/web/about/governance.
