San Felasco Nurseries, Inc. was founded in 1974 on a parcel of land adjacent to the San Felasco Hammock State Wildlife Preserve. Over the years we have expanded our operation to meet the needs of the industry and have grown into a one-stop source for retail nurseries, landscapers, and other wholesale buyers.

				In 2004 we registered the fictitious name Grandiflora and began doing business under our new name. The nursery is now branding its flowering plant line as "Grandiflora Grown...long-lasting southern blooms".

				Grandiflora  carries all the outdoor landscaping plants needed to garden in zones 7 through 10, from annuals and herbs in 4 inch pots - to shrubs, perennials, groundcovers, and flowering vines - to larger trees, palms and topiaries in 15 gallon containers. With 106 acres, we have become one of the largest wholesale nurseries in North Central Florida and are recognized as experts in the growing of herbaceous perennials.
				With our commitment to customer satisfaction and personalized service, Grandiflora welcomes the challenge of providing the Southeast with unusual and top quality plant material delivered weekly to your business.

Wintergreen Show  in Atlanta GA January 27-29, 2016

This winter show, organized by the Georgia Green Industry Association (GGIA), moved from humble origins in Athens GA to the Atlanta area in 2010.

This is an area with many affordable hotels and excellent restaurants, so consider making the trip to Georgia for an early peak at spring bloomers, evergreen shrubs, and deciduous trees.
Although the thermometer may be hovering around freezing outside, the action will be hot inside with attractive exhibits and challenging educational programs presented by horticultural experts from the University of Georgia and elsewhere around the country. Keep an eye out for former football Coach Vince Dooley who has become an ardent plant enthusiast since auditing one of Dr. Dirr's classes.
Picture - Grandiflora exhibited at Wintergreen for the first time in 2008, bringing lots of cool season color like Dianthus, Achillea, Diascia, Nemesia and Shasta Daisies.

In 2004, our Plantnik booth won best large exhibit! In 2006, our Painters booth also won best large exhibit.  In 2008 we constructed a bowling alley complete with a wooden lane, balls and pins, and salesmen in Grandiflora bowling shirts.

Grandiflora Displays at Gulf States Trade Show in Mobile Alabama
Alan was surrounded by Southern Belles at the opening night reception for the Gulf States Horticultural Expo in Mobile in February of 2015. The food, as always, was delicious, with an emphasis on fresh caught seafood from the Gulf. Best of all, no freezing weather and iced up roads this year!
The Grandiflora booth was one of the few with lots of winter/spring blooming perennials, and garnered much attention. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Grandiflora Wins Award at Landscape Show in Orlando

Grandiflora helps with Extreme Makeover House in December 2009

When the call went out for donations of plant material for the Extreme Makeover House being built in Gainesville, Grandiflora offered to supply many of the shrubs and all the annual color, with one stipulation - we would have to be involved in the planting. Heather, Alan, and Ellen showed up for work at 6 a.m. on the last day before the "reveal" to plant, and then returned the next day as the lucky family got to see its new house for the first time.
Ty Pennington and the other designers were all on hand  to "move that bus" as well as Gator cheerleaders, Albert and Alberta (the UF  mascots), and hundreds of volunteers who had worked 106 hours straight on the re-build. Be watching ABC Sunday nights in February to get a glimpse of our Grandiflora Grown plants installed at the Extreme Makeover 
house.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Alan Shapiro Represents Grandiflora at OFA Perennial Short Course in Buffalo NY September 2009

Grandiflora owner, Alan Shapiro, was flown to Buffalo NY in September to speak at the OFA Perennial Production Conference on the topic of adopting sustainable practices in a perennial growing operation. 
Besides sampling authentic Buffalo hot wings, Alan was able to hear presentations by experts from around the world, dine with John Friel and Allan Armitage, and visit the trial gardens at Cornell University.
 
 

 
Grandiflora Featured in Grower Talks Magazine April 2008

Grandiflora was featured as the cover story in the April 2008 issue of Grower Talks Magazine in an article entitled "Call it Thrifty, Call it Cheap - we call it Smart Business". The story focused on the nursery's efforts at sustainability including catching and re-using irrigation water, buying back customer's used plastic containers, and recycling aluminum cans, pallets, and old vehicles.


Alan Shapiro, owner of Grandiflora, speaks at Educational Events around the South

In 2006 and 2007, Alan Shapiro was asked to speak at Maclay Botanical Gardens in Tallahassee, the Jacksonville Zoo, the South Carolina Nursery Association Trade Show in Myrtle Beach, and the Charleston Winter Symposium.
				Most of these powerpoint presentations focused on the topic "Surprisingly Hardy Tropical-looking Perennials for Southern Gardens".

Alan and Ellen Shapiro go on Amazon Adventure
In February 2007, Alan and Ellen took a once in a lifetime plant exploration trip to the wilds of Brazil, starting from Manaus, a city 1000 miles up the Amazon River. Living and traveling in a boat that accommodated 24 passengers, the Shapiro's and their traveling companions (mostly aquatic plant enthusiasts), were in search of a rumored Dwarf Victoria Water Lily.
  Besides seeing exotic birds like caracaras, macaws, green parrots, and toucans, the Shapiro's also saw (and sometimes handled) monkeys, boa constrictors, sloths, iguanas, and caymans. They also found many exotic plants in the rain forest that unfortunately they could not bring back seeds or cuttings of, only pictures.
  Alan caught a black piranha while fishing for Peacock Bass, and it was delicious.
  


Grandiflora Hosts International Plant Propagators Society               
  

The Southern Region of the International Plant Propagators Society of North America
                 (IPPS) convened in Gainesville FL in October 2005 for their annual educational symposium, with members representing almost all of the 16 southeastern states in attendance. Alan Shapiro was site chairman and helped in the planning of the 4-day seminar which included three partial days of touring regional nurseries as well as classroom sessions at the Hilton/University Conference Center and time visiting the University of Florida Horticulture greenhouses.
Among the highlights of the event were dinner and a ramble at Kanapaha Botanical Gardens, a "Road-kill Soiree" party at Glen St. Mary Nursery, a stop at the McGuire Butterfly House, and a tour of Grandiflora. At the nursery, guests were shown the entire operation, from propagation to potting to shipping.
 
 
 

Grandiflora takes first prize at FNATS 2006

We won First Place Large Exhibit for our trade show booth at FNATS on September 28, 2006. The theme was color in the landscape, so we dressed as painters, complete with paint-splattered pants. Our signage declared "Grandiflora - it's all about color!" If we had brought extra pants, we could have sold them all.

Cingular Wireless Tower Constructed
Being so close to Interstate 75, Grandiflora was chosen as an ideal location for a Cingular Wireless Tower. Construction of the 200-foot tower was completed in May 2005.

2005 Trade Show Theme - A New Idea is Born
Announcing the Birth of Grandiflora
				  
In the winter of 2005, we dressed in scrubs in Myrtle Beach SC and Mobile AL to promote the birth of our new marketing program, winning booth awards at both shows. Pictured are sales manager Pat Stevens and salesman Mark Gruver.


New Loading Dock
In 2005, we completed construction on an impressive 115' X 40' covered loading dock with plans to double its size in the future. Now our truck loaders don't have to work in the dark, rain, lightning, hail, or blazing hot sun.				


San Felasco Nurseries, Inc. Becomes Grandiflora
A new name, logo and branding program will position the nursery to reach the next level of professionalism and become a major supplier of color for the entire southeast.
				  After 3 decades of customers and suppliers wrestling with the spelling and pronunciation of San Felasco, owners Alan and Ellen Shapiro announced plans to change the name of their 106-acre Florida nursery to Grandiflora. Coordinated with the name change will be the debut of a new whimsical logo and a branding program for the nursery's products. In the future, flowering plants will be marketed as "Grandiflora Grown" with the tag line "long-lasting Southern blooms". The Shapiro's hope that in time, retail nursery customers will request "Grandiflora Grown" plants just as they currently seek out products from Monrovia, Blooms of Bressingham and Proven Winners.


Let's Get Tropical!
Our Fall 2004 Trade Show theme promoted our hardy tropical line. 
The boys sported tropical shirts and Panama hats, and the booth was brimming with big leafy tropical-looking (but surprisingly cold hardy) plant material including canna lilies, crinums, palms, gingers, bananas, elephant ears, and philodendrons.

San Felasco wins Operation of the Year Award
 
At FNATS 2003, it was announced that San Felasco Nurseries had won Ornamental Outlook Magazine's Operation of the Year Award.			 This is the highest honor a nursery can win in the state of Florida, and part of the prize is to appear on the cover of the magazine.				

 
 
 
New Cold Frames
In early 2003, we finished construction of 8 new Jaderloon greenhouses sited just north of the office building to protect our perennials during the winter.

History

Tommy Feiber and Riley Blitch founded San Felasco Nurseries, Inc. in 1974 on a parcel of land adjacent to the San Felasco Hammock State Wildlife Preserve. Riley's father, Loonis Blitch, a former County Extension Agent, originally purchased the 100 acres that the nursery was developed on. San Felasco Nursery was established to propagate, grow and supply plants for Riley's retail nursery, the Garden Gate, and for Tommy's landscape company, Gainesville Landscape Contractors.
				

 
 
In 1975, Alan Shapiro was working at the Garden Gate Nursery when he learned of an opportunity to transfer to the "farm" and work at Riley and Tommy's growing operation. He agreed to take over management of San Felasco if he could earn ownership through sweat equity. The agreement was made, and Alan became part-owner.
				

 
 
For four years, Alan grew the business, producing more plants than the retail nursery and landscape company could use. With an ever-increasing inventory of plants, it was agreed that San Felasco should start marketing its excess to other wholesale buyers.
				

 
 
In the next few years, more land was cleared and more fields were installed as the business expanded. San Felasco developed a loyal customer base that included garden centers in Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa. Plants were delivered in an old bread van fitted with shelves.
				

 
 
Then in 1981, Riley Blitch and Tommy Feiber decided that they were no longer interested in wholesaling. Rather than dissolving the corporation, Alan bought San Felasco Nurseries, Inc. and moved his share of plants six miles down the road to a 15-acre parcel of land off Farnsworth Road that had been owned by the Penrods. 
				

 
 
During the first years after the move, a University of Florida Environmental Horticulture graduate named Mark Stewart was the only other San Felasco employee. They had one old 1966 Ford pickup truck, an old farm wagon, and a Myers sprayer. Mark lived on the property in a trailer. One field was developed and filled up and then another, and before long, the first 15 acres was full. Ten more acres were bought from Mrs. Romeis next door, and within a couple of years, they were filled too. 
				

 
 
With no neighbors willing to sell their property, in 1985 Alan was forced to look elsewhere for additional land. Luckily, he was able to buy an existing nursery with 16 acres that specialized in annual, vegetable and herb production just 5 miles away on Millhopper Road. He inherited from Gary and Janet Stein a fully staffed business, inventory and all, which complemented San Felasco's product line of woody shrubs and trees. That same year, the Shapiro's established a high-end retail nursery on Newberry Road near I-75 called the Plant Shoppe in Greenery Square.
				

 
 
In 1987, Shapiro purchased the 15 acres to the north, a fruit nursery that had belonged to Stan Michelini. Stan's shed and tree plantings form the backbone of San Felasco’s old display garden. 
				

 
 
The largest expansion of the nursery occurred in 1997 when 40 heavily wooded acres to the east were purchased from Mrs. Frase. Up until then, the main office was always at the 32nd Avenue location, but since the Millhopper Road location had grown to be three times as big, it seemed only logical to build the new office there.
				

 
 
The next three years saw the rapid expansion of the nursery with the installation of a state-of-the-art chemical mixing facility, construction of 18 cold frames, a potting barn, and 4 acres of shade, and the digging of a two million gallon pond for water re-use.
				

 
 
In 2001, 35 more acres were purchased to the northeast. This enlargement took us right to the fence line of I75, so the nursery became visible from the road.
				  Soon afterward, we sold the 25 acres on 32nd Avenue and consolidated all operations to the north location on Millhopper Road.
				

 
 
From 2003 to 2005, we added 15 new fields, a new potting barn, 8 cold frames, and a 2-acre retractable roof Cravo greenhouse. We also started pumping water from our recycling pond to irrigate over half the nursery. 
				

 
 
San Felasco Nurseries became Grandiflora in the summer of 2004 as we rolled out our new branding program and logo. Since the trade show in Atlanta, our flowering plant line has been promoted as “Grandiflora Grown ... long-lasting southern blooms” on large portrait tags designed by the John Henry Corporation.
				

 
 
In the fall of 2004, we were in the path of two of the four hurricanes that hit Florida. In both storms, trees fell on power lines in the nursery, cutting off our electricity for several days. The area around our recycling pond became full of runoff and flooded back into adjacent fields. Through the efforts of dedicated nursery employees, we were able to make repairs and get back to business quickly with only minor losses of plant material.
				

Since the hurricanes of 2005, we have built 6 new greenhouses for propagation of liners incorporating the latest, most up-to-date time clocks, chlorine injectors, hanging mist heads and colored shade cloth. We have also constructed a new barn/head house for the propagators to work in.  
				     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the recession which began in 2008, Grandiflora did little expansion, instead concentrating on improving efficiency, eliminating wastefulness, streamlining the infrastructure, upgrading its marketing efforts with a better web site, and positioning the nursery to come out strongly when the economy turns around. Like a well-trained athlete, Grandiflora is leaner, meaner and hungrier for success. The entire staff is hopeful that 2014 will be an exciting and profitable year.

From 2003 to 2005, we added 15 new fields, a new potting barn, 8 cold frames, and a 2-acre retractable roof Cravo greenhouse. We also started pumping water from our recycling pond to irrigate over half the nursery. 
				

 
 
San Felasco Nurseries became Grandiflora in the summer of 2004 as we rolled out our new branding program and logo. Since the trade show in Atlanta, our flowering plant line has been promoted as “Grandiflora Grown ... long-lasting southern blooms” on large portrait tags designed by the John Henry Corporation.
				

 
 
In the fall of 2004, we were in the path of two of the four hurricanes that hit Florida. In both storms, trees fell on power lines in the nursery, cutting off our electricity for several days. The area around our recycling pond became full of runoff and flooded back into adjacent fields. Through the efforts of dedicated nursery employees, we were able to make repairs and get back to business quickly with only minor losses of plant material.
				

Since the hurricanes of 2005, we have built 6 new greenhouses for propagation of liners incorporating the latest, most up-to-date time clocks, chlorine injectors, hanging mist heads and colored shade cloth. We have also constructed a new barn/head house for the propagators to work in.  
				     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the recession which began in 2008, Grandiflora did little expansion, instead concentrating on improving efficiency, eliminating wastefulness, streamlining the infrastructure, upgrading its marketing efforts with a better web site, and positioning the nursery to come out strongly when the economy turns around. Like a well-trained athlete, Grandiflora is leaner, meaner and hungrier for success. The entire staff is hopeful that 2014 will be an exciting and profitable year.

HEAT AND HARDINESS ZONE MAPS

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    	Plant Hardiness Zone Map of the US Dept. of Agriculture 
Hardiness is most commonly understood as the ability of a plant to endure low temperatures. More appropriately, it should be considered as the ability of a plant to thrive in a variety of physical conditions.
				The U. S. Department of Agriculture's Plant Hardiness Zone Map provides a recommended range in which a plant will grow well. The map identifies eleven zones according to climate: the colder the winter temperature, the lower the zone number. Zone ratings are designed to indicate that a plant will not merely survive in a zone, but thrive. The zones are approximate, however, so some gardeners experiment with growing plants rated hardy for one zone north or one zone south of their location. Other factors â such as high temperatures, rainfall, altitude, soil and drainage, available light, and air quality â should also be considered when choosing plants for your area.

     	Plant Heat Zone Map of the American Hort. Society
In 1997, Dr. H. Marc Cathey, President Emeritus of the American Horticultural Society (AHS), working with the Meteorological Evaluation Service Co. Inc., produced the AHS Plant Heat Zone Map, thus completing the circle of information available to establish a plant's likelihood of survival from extremes in temperature. The 12-zone map indicates the average number of days each year that a particular region experiences "heat days" - those days with temperatures over 86 degrees and the point at which plants experience damage to cellular proteins. The zones range from Zone 1 (with no heat days) to Zone 12 (210 or more heat days).
