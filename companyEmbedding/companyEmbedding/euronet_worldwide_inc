S&P 500 hesitates near record territory, Dow industrials nail the bottom of the gap
U.S. stocks are mixed early Monday, treading water amid a light economic calendar, and generally positive global equity markets.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has pulled in from an early-session high (2,450.4) not too distant from record territory (2,453.8).  Meanwhile, the Dow industrials continue to find support matching the bottom of the June gap (21,384), notching an early-session low within three points.

The Company offers various value added services, including ATM and POS dynamic currency conversion, advertising, customer relationship management (CRM), prepaid mobile top-up, bill payment, fraud management and foreign remittance payout. The Company provides the services either through its Euronet-owned ATMs and POS terminals, through contracts under which it operates ATMs and POS terminals on behalf of its customers as stand-alone products. Through this segment, the Company also offers a suite of integrated EFT software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems.Euronet offers outsourced management services to financial institutions, merchants, mobile phone operators and other organizations using the Company's processing centers' electronic financial transaction processing software. The Company's outsourced management services include management of existing ATM networks, development of new ATM networks, management of POS networks, management of automated deposit terminals, management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services. The services include around the clock monitoring of each ATM's status and cash condition, managing the cash levels in each ATM, coordinating the cash delivery and providing automatic dispatches for necessary service calls. The Company also provides real-time transaction authorization, monitoring, network gateway access, network switching, customer service, maintenance, cash settlement and reconciliation, forecasting and reporting.Euronet-branded ATM networks, also known as IAD networks, are managed by a processing center that uses the Company's internally developed software solution. The ATMs in the Company's independent ATM deployed (IAD) networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of financial institutions and international card organizations, such as American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club International, Discover and China Union Pay, as well as international ATM networks such as PULSE. The Company receives fees from its customers for six types of ATM transactions: cash withdrawals, cash deposits, balance inquiries, transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization, dynamic currency conversion, and prepaid telecommunication recharges.The Company's network of owned or operated ATMs allows for the sale of financial and other products or services.

Euronet offers multinational merchants a Single European Payments Area (SEPA)-compliant cross-border transaction processing solution. The Company also offers a suite of integrated software solutions for electronic payments and transaction delivery systems. The Company's ITM software is used by processing centers.epay SegmentAs of December 31, 2016, the Company offered prepaid mobile airtime top-up services and other prepaid and payment products on a network of approximately 661,000 POS terminals across approximately 305,000 retailer locations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, the United States and South America. The Company's processing centers for the epay Segment are located in London, the United Kingdom; Martinsried, Germany; Milan, Italy, and Kansas City, Missouri. In addition to prepaid mobile airtime, the Company offers a range of products across its retail networks, including prepaid debit cards, gift cards, prepaid vouchers, transport payments, lottery payments, prepaid digital content, such as music, games and software, prepaid long distance and bill payment.The Company distributes personal identification numbers (PINs) in two ways. First, it establishes an electronic connection to the mobile operator and the retailer. When the sale to a customer is initiated, the terminal requests the PIN from the mobile operator through its transaction processing platform. These transactions obtain the PIN directly from the mobile operator and, therefore, Euronet does not carry PIN inventory. The customer pays. The Company maintains systems, which know the amount of mobile top-up sold by the retailer. Second, the Company purchases PINs from the mobile operator, which are electronically sent to its processing platform.The Company processes prepaid mobile airtime top-up transactions on its POS network across Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, North America and South America for two types of clients: distributors and retailers. Both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a retail store. The retailer uses a programmed POS terminal in the store, the retailer's electronic cash register (ECR) system, or Web-based POS device that is connected to its network to buy prepaid mobile airtime. The customer selects a predefined amount of mobile airtime from the carrier of choice, and the retailer enters the selection into the POS terminal. The consumer pays that amount to the retailer (in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer). The POS device then transmits the selected transaction to the Company's processing center. Using the electronic connection, the Company maintains with the mobile phone operator or drawing from its inventory of PINs, the purchased amount of mobile airtime will be either credited to the consumer's account or delivered through a PIN printed by the terminal and given to the consumer. In the case of PINs printed by the terminal, the consumer must then call the mobile phone operator's toll-free number to activate the purchased airtime to the consumer's mobile account.The Company's POS network is used for the distribution of other products and services. Its additional products include long distance calling card plans, prepaid Internet plans, debit cards, gift cards, prepaid vouchers, transport payments, lottery payments, bill payment and digital content, such as music, games and software. Through the Company's cadooz subsidiary, it also distributes vouchers and physical gifts. In certain locations, the terminals used for prepaid services are used for electronic funds transfer to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise.The Company provides its prepaid services through POS terminals or Web-based POS devices installed in retail outlets or retailers, through direct connections between their efficient consumer response (ECR) systems and its processing centers. In markets where the Company operates technology (the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Poland, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, Greece, India, Italy, Brazil and the United States), the Company owns and maintains the POS terminals. In certain countries in Europe, the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer.Money Transfer SegmentThe Company provides global money transfer services under the brand names Ria and HiFX. Ria provides consumer-to-consumer money transfer services through a network of more than 243,000 locations and its Website riamoneytransfer.com.

Through its TeleRia service, customers connect to its call center from a telephone available at an agent location and a representative collects the information over the telephone and enters it directly into the Company's system.
