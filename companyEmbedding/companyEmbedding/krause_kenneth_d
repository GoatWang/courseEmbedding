PITTSBURGH, Dec. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of MSA (NYSE:   MSA) has elected Kenneth D. Krause, 40, to the position of Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.  In this new role, Mr. Krause, a 10-year veteran of MSA, succeeds interim CFO Kerry Bove, who will resume his normal responsibilities as Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.  Mr. Bove was appointed to the interim CFO role in August following the departure of Stacy McMahan, who resigned from the company to accept a CFO position at a medical device and life-sciences company.   
Mr. Krause began his career with MSA in 2006 as Director of Internal Audit.  In 2009 he was promoted to Director of Decision Support, a controllership function responsible for accounting, financial reporting and planning, forecasting, and analysis across all of MSA's global regions.   From 2013 to August of this year, Mr. Krause served as Executive Director of Global Finance and Assistant Treasurer, responsible for financial planning and analysis, tax compliance and planning, treasury management, investor relations, and portfolio management of MSA's defined benefit pension plan.   In August he was elected an officer of the company and promoted to the position of Vice President, Strategic Finance and Treasurer.
"Ken has done an excellent job in guiding virtually every aspect of MSA's financial management and planning processes over the past several years, and particularly so during this transitional period," said William M. Lambert, MSA Chairman and CEO.  "In particular, Ken has played an integral role in executing the financial aspects of MSA's corporate strategy. This includes modernizing our capital structure and renegotiating a number of our credit facilities to provide access to almost $600 million of capital at historically low rates, developing a more effective forecasting process that allows us to respond faster to changing business conditions, and driving finance initiatives to support MSA's inorganic growth priorities, including our recent acquisition of UK-based Latchways," Mr. Lambert said.
Most recently, Mr. Krause, working with MSA's executive leadership team, led efforts to create a global cost reduction roadmap that is expected to deliver $10 million in cost savings in 2016.  "In addition to these contributions, it should be noted that Ken also has done a great job in strengthening and expanding the scope of our investor relations program," Mr. Lambert said. "Through that process, I know he has earned a great deal of trust and respect among those in the investment community who follow MSA."  
"Ken's election to CFO represents the confidence the Board of Directors, our officers and I have in his ability to lead and protect the financial health of MSA," Mr. Lambert said. "On this occasion I also would like to express my appreciation for the fine contributions Kerry Bove made as our interim CFO during this transitional period."
A native of Saxonburg, Pa., Mr. Krause earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from Slippery Rock University, and also has an MBA from the University of Pittsburgh.  He is a Certified Public Accountant and spent more than seven years in Public Accounting, including serving as Senior Manager of Assurance Advisory Services for KPMG, LLP of Pittsburgh, Pa.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

    At first I was a little weary, being sent to a psychiatrist to help out with my anxiety from my primary Doctor. Mostly because I was just used to seeing her, and idk I guess admitting to myself...

ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Krause's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Krause saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Depression (75% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Depression:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costModerate

Depression is a disorder of the brain that goes beyond feeling sad or fatigued for a few days. Depression is a persistent condition that lasts for weeks or months at a time and interferes with a person’s ability to function in daily life. It has a number of causes, including genetics and neurochemical imbalances as well as environmental, psychological, and social factors.

Full Description


Depression (also called major depression or clinical depression) is a disorder where a person experiences negative feelings such as sadness, apathy, fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. It can interfere with sleep, appetite, and sex drive. In severe cases it can lead to psychosis or thoughts of suicide. Depression is best understood as a disorder that is caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. It is not a matter of simply feeling sad or blue, and is not a condition that a person can overcome by force of will. In other words, depression is not something that a person can beat simply because he or she wants to or because someone told him or her to “get over it.” Treating depression is typically done through a combination of medication and therapy in order to address the neurochemical, psychological, sociocultural, and behavioral aspects of the condition. Eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, avoiding alcohol, and joining a support group are other ways to help treat depression. Depression affects people of all ages and walks of life. Most individuals begin to experience symptoms between the ages of 15 – 30, though depression in children is not uncommon.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
