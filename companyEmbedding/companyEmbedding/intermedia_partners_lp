    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Michael Gold
Chief Executive Officer

Michael Gold leads Intermedia, a company that offers a broad and tightly integrated suite of highly-supported cloud business applications. Gold joined Intermedia in 2011, when he and former SAVVIS CEO Phil Koen partnered with private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners, to acquire the company from its founder. In February 2017, Intermedia closed the sale of the company to current private equity sponsor, Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP), and management.
Since 2011, Intermedia has more than tripled revenues, operating profits, users and product offerings. Intermedia has transformed from a business email and web hosting company to a leading provider of over 30 integrated cloud applications. Furthermore, Intermedia has transformed from a mostly direct to business provider to a leading provider of a cloud management platform to the channel with approximately 70% of Intermedia’s new sales now coming from its partners. As part of the MDP family, Gold and Intermedia management will accelerate growth and Intermedia's leadership position, while identifying opportunities to best support businesses and the channel partners that serve them.
Gold has 20+ years of senior management experience in cloud services and channel development. Before joining Intermedia, Gold was CEO of Zlago, a cloud services company he founded and grew via a nationwide network of managed service providers, VARs, and other channel partners. Intermedia acquired Zlago in 2011. Previously, Gold was a Senior Vice President at cloud automation provider, Parallels. Gold came to Parallels through its acquisition of Sphera, a cloud services company where he served as CEO.
Gold has held a variety of other executive roles in the industry, including CEO of software company, Vicorp, and Senior Vice President of Qwest Communications, where he had P&L responsibility for the internet Products business and launched Qwest's CyberCenter datacenter and hosting business. Gold holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois and an MBA from Stanford University.

Through integrated portals, partners can educate themselves, generate leads, drive sales and support their customers from a single source throughout the customer lifecycle. These efforts have resulted in Shamkova being named as a CRN Women of the Channel several years running.
