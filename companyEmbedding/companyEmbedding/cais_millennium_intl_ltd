CAIS Expands Hedge Fund Menu

June 14, 2010




CAIS Continues to Expand Offering of Top-Tier Investment Funds
NEW YORK, NY – June 14, 2010 – CAIS, a New York based financial technology company providing an independent, alternative investments platform to the wealth management industry, announced the ongoing expansion of its funds menu with access to product managed by Paulson & Co., Millennium International Management LP, D.E. Shaw & Co., and Highbridge Capital Management LLC.
“CAIS is committed to offering a wide selection of top-tier alternative investment funds that represent a diversity of strategies,” said Rafay Farooqui, Managing Principal of CAIS. “Our platform has grown to approximately 20 funds that range in strategies from Multi-Strategy, CTA, Global Macro, Long-Short Equity, Event Driven, Distressed and Credit.”
CAIS is continuously evaluating new managers to add to the platform while Mercer Investment Consulting is conducting due diligence prior to their acceptance. Through the CAIS platform, investment minimums are lowered, in most cases, to $100K per subscription.
“We believe our growing menu of industry leading investment managers coupled with lower minimums will enable wealth advisors to better meet their clients’ alternative investment needs,” said Rafay Farooqui.
