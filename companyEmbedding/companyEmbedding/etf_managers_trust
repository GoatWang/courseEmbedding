(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report (the "Report"). The discussion and analysis which follows may contain trend analysis and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial results. Words such as "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "outlook" and "estimate," as well as similar words and phrases, signify forward-looking statements. ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I's forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions, and important factors, risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the Federal securities laws, ETF Managers Capital, LLC undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report.  Overview  ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the "Trust") is a Delaware statutory trust formed on July 23, 2014, and it is a series trust consisting of one series: Sit Rising Rate ETF (the "Fund" and any future series will be a "Fund"). The Fund issues common units, called the "Shares," representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in the Fund. The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement").  ETF Managers Capital, LLC (the "Sponsor") shall have the power and authority to establish and designate one or more series ("Funds") and to issue shares thereof, from time to time as it deems necessary or desirable. The Sponsor shall have exclusive power to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences as between the shares of any series as to the right of redemption, special and relative rights as to dividends and other distributions and on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the series shall have separate voting rights or no voting rights. The term for which the Trust is to exist commenced on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Trust, and the Trust and any Fund shall exist in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each Fund and the assets associated with a Fund shall be held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the assets of any other Fund. Each Fund shall be separate from all other Funds created as series of the Trust in respect of the assets and liabilities allocated to that Fund and shall represent a separate investment portfolio of the Trust.  The sole Trustee of the Trust is Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the "Trustee"), and the Trustee serves as the Trust's corporate trustee as required under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act ("DSTA"). The Trustee's principal offices are located at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890. The Trustee is unaffiliated with the Sponsor. The rights and duties of the Trustee and the Sponsor with respect to the offering of the Shares and Fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the DSTA and by the Trust Agreement.  On January 29, 2015, the initial Form S-1 for the Fund was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On January 8, 2015, 4 Creation Baskets for the Fund were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. The Fund began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Arca on February 19, 2015.  The Fund is designed and managed to track the performance of a portfolio (the "Benchmark Portfolio") consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities ("Treasury Instruments") weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration (the "Benchmark Component Instruments").  - 20 -  The Investment Objective of the Fund  The Fund's investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the Benchmark Portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio.  The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC ("Sit") and will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month and on the next business day if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio as of March 31, 2015 include:  Name Ticker Market Value USD US 5YR FUTR OPTN MAY15C FVK5C1190 (60,586) US 5YR NOTE (CBT) JUN15 FVM5 (3,125,484 ) US 2 YR NOTE (CBT) JUN15 TUM5 (13,587,688 ) US 10YR FUT OPTN MAY15P TYK5P1275 4,813  The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available on the Fund's website at www.risingrateetf.com.  The weighting of the Treasury Instruments constituting the Benchmark Component Instruments will be based on each maturity's duration contribution. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings of the Benchmark Component Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In such an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting in the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly, on the 15th, except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution.  The Sponsor anticipates that approximately 5% to 15% of the Fund's assets will be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to collateralize its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets, from which it will post margin to its FCM, in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM. On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund's administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below.  - 21 -  The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested in Benchmark Component Instruments and rebalanced, as noted above, to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant, and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors being constant. Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number of limitations. Duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and long-term securities. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.  The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund's NAV and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.  The Sponsor  ETF Managers Capital, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust and the Fund. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company, formed on June 12, 2014. The principal office is located at 35 Beechwood Road, Suite 2B, Summit, NJ 07901. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator ("CPO") with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and became a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA") on September 23, 2014. The Trust and the Fund operates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.  The Sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC ("ETFMG"), a limited liability company domiciled and headquartered in New Jersey. The Sponsor maintains its main business office at 35 Beechwood Road, Suite 2B, Summit, NJ 07901.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has exclusive management and control of all aspects of the Trust's business. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise the performance of the Sponsor, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The shareholders have no voice in the day to day management of the business and operations of the Fund and the Trust, other than certain limited voting rights as set forth in the Trust Agreement. In the course of its management of the business and affairs of the Fund and the Trust, the Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, appoint an affiliate or affiliates of the Sponsor as additional sponsors and retain such persons, including affiliates of the Sponsor, as it deems necessary to effectuate and carry out the purposes, business and objectives of the Trust.  Results of Operations  COMPARISON OF PER SHARE RISE NAV TO RISE MARKET VALUE  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  [[Image Removed]]  NEITHER THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND NOR THE PRIOR INDEX LEVELS AND CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE FUND'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  The per Share market value of RISE and its NAV tracked closely for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015.  -22-  COMPARISON OF PER SHARE RISE NAV TO BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  [[Image Removed]]  NEITHER THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND NOR THE PRIOR BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO LEVELS AND CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE FUND'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  The graph above compares the return of RISE with the benchmark portfolio returns for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015. The difference in the NAV price and the benchmark value often results in the appearance of a NAV discount to the benchmark. The difference is related to the cumulative impact on NAV of the Fund's expenses.  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  Fund Share Price Performance  During the period from February 19, 2015 (commencement of Shares trading on the NYSE Arca) to March 31, 2015, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share decreased (-2.56%) from $24.96 per Share, representing the initial trade on February 20, 2015, to $24.32 per Share, representing the closing price on March 31, 2015. The Share price high and low for the period from February 20, 2015 to March 31, 2015 and related change from the initial Share price on February 20, 2015 was as follows: Shares traded from a high of $25.17 per Share (+0.84%) on March 6, 2015 to a low of $24.50 per Share (-1.84%) on March 20, 2015.  Fund Share Net Asset Performance  For the period from February 19, 2015 (commencement of investment operations) to March 31, 2015, the net asset value of each Share decreased (-2.92%) from $25.00 per Share to $24.27 per Share. For the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015 losses in the futures and options contracts and fund expenses resulted in the overall decrease in the NAV per Share during the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015.  Net loss for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015, was $178,267, resulting from net realized losses on futures and options contracts of $11,396, net unrealized losses on futures and options contracts of $156,031, and the net operating loss of $10,840.  Calculating NAV  The Fund's NAV is calculated by:  � Taking the current market value of its total assets;  - 23 -  The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Fund once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the CME closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the CME) for the contracts traded on the CME, but calculates or determines the value of all other Fund investments using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor. "Other information" customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the Fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.  In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day's closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the Fund traded on the CME. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the Fund's investments.  The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the CME are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the Fund's shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time CME trading prices for contracts traded on the CME are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the CME's immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other investments and U.S. Treasuries held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.  The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca's website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.  Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value. If the market price of the Fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Treasury Instruments. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Fund's critical accounting policies are as follows:  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Fund's application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates. Actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material. The Fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund, which are held at fair value.  The Fund calculates its net asset value as of the NAV Calculation Time as described above.  - 24 -  The values which are used by the Fund for its Treasury Instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available. In addition, the Fund estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.  Credit Risk  When the Fund enters into Benchmark Component Instruments, it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit risk, the counterparty for the Benchmark Component Instruments traded on the CME and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the Fund.  The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally:  � executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;  � limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Fund;  � not posting margin directly with a counterparty;  � limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and  � ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for.  The Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA") requires all FCMs, such as the Fund's clearing broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers' funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.  On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash, cash equivalents and/or the collateralizing Treasury Securities that it holds. The Fund's liquidity needs include: redeeming its shares, providing margin deposits for existing Benchmark Component Instruments, the purchase of additional Benchmark Component Instruments, and paying expenses.  The Fund generates cash primarily from (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing Treasury Securities. Generally, all of the net assets of the Fund are allocated to trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. Most of the assets of the Fund are held in Treasury Instruments, cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Benchmark Component Instruments change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the Fund is paid to the Fund.  - 25 -  The investments of the Fund in Benchmark Component Instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. Such conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating a position in Benchmark Component Instruments.  Market Risk  Trading in Benchmark Component Instruments such as futures contracts will involve the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the Fund as the Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, the Fund's market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make delivery under the contracts. The Fund considers the "fair value" of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the commitment by the Fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held.  The exposure of the Fund to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the instrument-specific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the Fund.  Regulatory Environment  The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts, and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.  The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in the Fund, or the ability of the Fund to continue to implement its investment strategy. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse.  The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC describing its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records . . .  May 15, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

ETF Industry to Get a Product on Marijuana?HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 4 hrs 41 minsS&P 5002,469.00-6.42 (-0.26%)Dow 3021,796.60+0.05 (+0.00%)Nasdaq6,363.33-18.86 (-0.30%)Stocks to WatchIntel impresses with strong quarter, Starbucks and Mattel shares are tankingETF Industry to Get a Product on Marijuana?Sanghamitra SahaZacksFebruary 23, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareAny industry that is growing by leaps and bounds does not skip ETF issuers’ eyes. The marijuana industry is on a tear lately. As per the source, cannabis-related stocks added about 236% in 2016. Plus, marijuana sales are likely to boost government’s treasury.As a result, usage of medical marijuana has now been approved in 18 U.S. states. Over half of the 50 states now have laws legalizing marijuana for recreational or medicinal uses, as per the source. This makes it clear why ETF Managers Trust has filed for a fund targeting the industry (read: 6 ETF Ideas Most Favored by Issuers in 2016).Inside the Proposed FundThe fund – Emerging AgroSphere ETF – looks to track the total return performance of the Emerging AgroSphere Index. The index looks to track the performance of the exchange-listed common stock of companies across the globe that are into legalized medical research on natural or synthetic cannabidiol CBD, which can result in government-approved prescription drugs.The companies need to qualify the size and liquidity requirements before the inclusion into the index. The index provider will look at publicly available sources to decide which companies to add to the index.The proposed fund will not invest in any company that belongs to the non-medical marijuana market, as of now. The expense ratio and the ticker code of the fund is yet to be disclosed.How Does It Fit in the Portfolio?While medical usage of marijuana is legalized in many areas, lately there has been a surge in legalization in the recreational usage of marijuana in some U.S. states.In an election held in 2016, marijuana was declared legal for recreational and medical purposes in seven additional states. Maine, California, Massachusetts, and Nevada all approved the legalization of recreational marijuana use, while Arizona’s highly opposed Proposition 205 recreational marijuana measure failed. Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas too went in favor of legalizes medical marijuana use and Montana expanded the state’s medical marijuana laws.Legal marijuana sales surged 34% to $6.9 billion in 2016 according to cannabis research firm ArcView. The firm expects the sales figure to skyrocket by about 213% by 2021. Investment firm Cowen & Co. is also bullish on the space and expects legal marijuana sales to hit $50 billion by 2026. So, clearly it is a high growth industry and is an intriguing tool for money making (read: 6 Best Commodity ETFs of 2016).ETF CompetitionThe road ahead for the product is almost clear. It will not face any direct competition, if at all it gets an approval, as the space is void of similar products. However, some biopharmaceutical companies may pose threats to the product as the fund mainly targets companies involved in marijuana dealings for medical purpose.If you consider that as a risk, keep a track on the likes of iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF SBIO or SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI. All these funds charge 47 bps, 50 bps and 35 bps in fees. As a result, the proposed fund needs to be priced competitively (read: Big Changes to BioShares Biotech ETFs: Who's In, Who's Out?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

The Sponsor causes the Fund to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation
Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities. The Sponsor
will invest the proceeds in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or less,
cash and/or cash equivalents and in futures contracts and options on futures
contracts on U.S. Treasuries. When the Fund purchases a futures contract, the
Fund is required to deposit with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a
portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure
payment for the obligation at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin.
The Fund will receive or pay, depending on market movement, variation margin as
the value of the futures position increase or decreases. The Fund will pay
premiums on the options contracts that it purchases. The Sponsor will invest the
assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in U.S. Treasuries,
cash and/or cash equivalents Subject to these margin and collateral
requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of
assets that are:

· held on deposit with the FCM or other custodian,

· used for other investments, and

· held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 10% of the Fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed as
margin for futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for
exchange-traded contracts based on changes in their value. In light of the
differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded contracts and
the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not
possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin
or collateral at any given time. The U.S. Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents
held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing
margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be used for the
Fund’s benefit. The Sponsor invests the balance of the Fund’s assets not
invested in futures or options on U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or
less, cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for
changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase
margin or collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading
positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no
bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in
segregation pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

Company Description
The ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory
trust formed on July 23, 2014. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant to
the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, of which the Fund is currently the sole
series. The Fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common


 shares of
beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca stock
exchange (“NYSE Arca”). The Fund is managed and controlled by ETF Managers
Capital LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor
is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) and is a member of the National Futures
Association (“NFA”). Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC (“Sit”) is registered as
a “commodity trading advisor” (“CTA”) and will act as such for the Fund.

The Fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by
tracking the performance of a portfolio (the “Benchmark Portfolio”) consisting
of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year
U.S. Treasury securities (“Treasury Instruments”) weighted to achieve a targeted
negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration (the “Benchmark Component
Instruments”). The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing
in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark
Portfolio. The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit and will be rebalanced,
reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month and on the
next business day if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the
national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective
duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short
position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or
options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Benchmark Component
Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated
rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available on
the Fund’s website at www.risingrateetf.com.

The weighting of the Treasury Instruments constituting the Benchmark Component
Instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution. The expected
range for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity
Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected range for the
duration weighted percentage of the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments will
be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings of the Benchmark Component
Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes
in the shape of the yield curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began
raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In 
such an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will 
increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting in the 
10 year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite
if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more than 
short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur 
monthly, on the 15th, except for as noted above or if there are radical 
changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of 
a range from negative nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, 
in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments 
before the next expected monthly reconstitution.

The Sponsor anticipates that approximately 5% to 15% of the Fund’s assets will
be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to
collateralize its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets,
from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant (“FCM”), in an
amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to
its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When
establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to
deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of
each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin
requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM.
On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive,
variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level
of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as
margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund’s administrator in cash or cash
equivalents as discussed below.

The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested in Benchmark Component Instruments and
rebalanced, as noted above, to maintain a negative average effective portfolio
duration of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price
sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios with longer
durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For
example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an
effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being
constant, and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration
of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors being constant.
Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number
of limitations. Duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity
provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and
long-term securities. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value
when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt
securities.

The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund
will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit
quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or
as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other liquidity purposes and
to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses
and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect
correlation between changes in the Fund’s NAV and changes in the Benchmark
Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.
