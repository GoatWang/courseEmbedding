New York-based Assurant, Inc., a provider of specialty insurance products and services, announced the appointment of Alan B. Colberg, as president, effective immediately, and as chief executive officer and director of the company’s board, effective Jan. 1, 2015.
He succeeds Robert B. Pollock who announced his plan to retire earlier this year after 33 years with the company.
Since joining Assurant in March 2011, Colberg has served as executive vice president, marketing and business development where he was responsible for fully integrating Assurant’s strategy with enterprise-wide and business-level innovation and growth plans.
Colberg joined Assurant following a 22-year career with Bain & Company, Inc. During his tenure there, he held numerous operational and leadership roles. He served as Bain’s global practice leader for Financial Services and advised leading global companies such as Assurant.
Pollock, 60, will work closely with Colberg during his remaining time at the company to ensure a smooth transition.
