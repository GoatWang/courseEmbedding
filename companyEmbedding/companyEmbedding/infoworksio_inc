Infoworks.io - Dynamic Data Warehouse

















































































Infoworks


            The Hadoop Data Warehouse

Infoworks is the only solution providing complete functionality in a single platform from data ingestion, data synchronization and the building of data models and cubes
Scale your data warehousing and analytics on Hadoop, not by adding armies of people but instead by using advanced machine intelligence












THE CHALLENGE

                Most enterprise companies have invested in Hadoop to lower their Enterprise Data Warehouse costs. Unfortunately, moving data and workloads from the EDW to Hadoop is going too slowly, because the migration of workloads from the EDW to Hadoop is too complex, is manually intensive and does not provide the timely access to data and the performance required by business users.
