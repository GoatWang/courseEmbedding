Orion Bus Industries and Ontario Bus Industries in Canada and Bus Industries of America in the United States, was a privately owned bus manufacturer based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada since 1975. The company had a manufacturing plant in Mississauga and sent bus body shells to their plant in Oriskany, New York, for final assembly and testing of vehicles destined for US markets.[citation needed]

5.1 Hybrid buses





Corporate history[edit]
Taken over by the Ontario Government in 1994 for loan arrears, was sold in 1995 to Western Star Truck Holdings, Kelowna B.C., which in turn was acquired by Daimler Chrysler (now Daimler AG) in July 2000, and became part of the group Daimler Buses North America.[1]
On April 25, 2012, Orion International ceased taking orders for new buses, and the Missisauga plant was scheduled to close once outstanding orders were fulfilled.[2]
The Oriskany plant was initially retained for aftermarket support only.[3] Following the sale of that business to New Flyer (which also acquired some of Orion's outstanding orders at the time of shutdown), the fate of the New York location remains unclear although it is still currently[when?] performing repairs, including a retrofit program with BAE Systems for recalled hybrid-electric buses using BAE's HybriDrive system.
The sales and closures are part of the closure of Daimler Buses North America; only Daimler's imported Setra buses will continue to be marketed although North American distribution will be taken over by Motor Coach Industries (MCI). Production of Daimler Buses North America's Sprinter shuttle buses will be moved to other facilities. It was announced that more than 530 workers will be laid off in the Mississauga and Oriskany plants. The Mississauga workers staged a wildcat work stoppage to protest in employee frustration at the slow pace of winding-down talks.[4][5]
Oriskany was the head office for part department to support Orion bus operators until New Flyer acquired the after market business from Daimler Buses. MCI, which acquired the distribution rights for Setra buses, has also since been purchased by New Flyer.

Orion Bus Industries and Ontario Bus Industries in Canada and Bus Industries of America in the United States, was a privately owned bus manufacturer based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada since 1975. The company had a manufacturing plant in Mississauga and sent bus body shells to their plant in Oriskany, New York, for final assembly and testing of vehicles destined for US markets.[citation needed]

5.1 Hybrid buses





Corporate history[edit]
Taken over by the Ontario Government in 1994 for loan arrears, was sold in 1995 to Western Star Truck Holdings, Kelowna B.C., which in turn was acquired by Daimler Chrysler (now Daimler AG) in July 2000, and became part of the group Daimler Buses North America.[1]
On April 25, 2012, Orion International ceased taking orders for new buses, and the Missisauga plant was scheduled to close once outstanding orders were fulfilled.[2]
The Oriskany plant was initially retained for aftermarket support only.[3] Following the sale of that business to New Flyer (which also acquired some of Orion's outstanding orders at the time of shutdown), the fate of the New York location remains unclear although it is still currently[when?] performing repairs, including a retrofit program with BAE Systems for recalled hybrid-electric buses using BAE's HybriDrive system.
The sales and closures are part of the closure of Daimler Buses North America; only Daimler's imported Setra buses will continue to be marketed although North American distribution will be taken over by Motor Coach Industries (MCI). Production of Daimler Buses North America's Sprinter shuttle buses will be moved to other facilities. It was announced that more than 530 workers will be laid off in the Mississauga and Oriskany plants. The Mississauga workers staged a wildcat work stoppage to protest in employee frustration at the slow pace of winding-down talks.[4][5]
Oriskany was the head office for part department to support Orion bus operators until New Flyer acquired the after market business from Daimler Buses. MCI, which acquired the distribution rights for Setra buses, has also since been purchased by New Flyer.

Orion Bus Industries and Ontario Bus Industries in Canada and Bus Industries of America in the United States, was a privately owned bus manufacturer based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada since 1975. The company had a manufacturing plant in Mississauga and sent bus body shells to their plant in Oriskany, New York, for final assembly and testing of vehicles destined for US markets.[citation needed]

5.1 Hybrid buses





Corporate history[edit]
Taken over by the Ontario Government in 1994 for loan arrears, was sold in 1995 to Western Star Truck Holdings, Kelowna B.C., which in turn was acquired by Daimler Chrysler (now Daimler AG) in July 2000, and became part of the group Daimler Buses North America.[1]
On April 25, 2012, Orion International ceased taking orders for new buses, and the Missisauga plant was scheduled to close once outstanding orders were fulfilled.[2]
The Oriskany plant was initially retained for aftermarket support only.[3] Following the sale of that business to New Flyer (which also acquired some of Orion's outstanding orders at the time of shutdown), the fate of the New York location remains unclear although it is still currently[when?] performing repairs, including a retrofit program with BAE Systems for recalled hybrid-electric buses using BAE's HybriDrive system.
The sales and closures are part of the closure of Daimler Buses North America; only Daimler's imported Setra buses will continue to be marketed although North American distribution will be taken over by Motor Coach Industries (MCI). Production of Daimler Buses North America's Sprinter shuttle buses will be moved to other facilities. It was announced that more than 530 workers will be laid off in the Mississauga and Oriskany plants. The Mississauga workers staged a wildcat work stoppage to protest in employee frustration at the slow pace of winding-down talks.[4][5]
Oriskany was the head office for part department to support Orion bus operators until New Flyer acquired the after market business from Daimler Buses. MCI, which acquired the distribution rights for Setra buses, has also since been purchased by New Flyer.

(more...)(1) Anyone who receives something. Usually, the term refers to someone who inherits a deceased person's property. If the deceased person dies without a will (called intestate), state law determines what each distributee will receive. Also called a beneficiary.

MARITAL LIFE ESTATE TRUSTSee AB trust.

LAPSEUnder a will, the failure of a gift of property. A gift lapses when the beneficiary dies before the person who made the will, and no alternate has been named. S... (more...)Under a will, the failure of a gift of property. A gift lapses when the beneficiary dies before the person who made the will, and no alternate has been named. Some states have anti-lapse statutes, which prevent gifts to relatives of the deceased person from lapsing unless the relative has no heirs of his or her own. A lapsed gift becomes part of the residuary estate.

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA)A federal law passed to protect pension rights.

ERISA: sets minimum standards for pension plans, guaranteeing that pension rights cannot be unfairly denied to or taken from a worker provides some protection for workers in the event certain types of pension plans cannot pay the benefits to which workers are entitled, and requires that employers provide full and clear information about employees' pension rights, including the way pension benefits accumulate, how the company invests pension funds, and when and how pension benefits can be collected.

FAMILY POT TRUSTSee pot trust.

ADMINISTRATORA person appointed by a probate court to handle the distribution of property of someone who has died without a will, or with a will that fails to name someone t... (more...)A person appointed by a probate court to handle the distribution of property of someone who has died without a will, or with a will that fails to name someone to carry out this task. administrator ad litem A person appointed by a probate court to represent an estate during a lawsuit. (Ad litem is Latin for 'during the litigation.') An administrator ad litem is appointed only if there is no existing executor or administrator of the estate, or if the executor or administrator has conflicting interests. For example, Jerry's will leaves most of his property to his brother, Jeff, and also names Jeff as executor of the will. But Jerry's sister, Janine, feels that Jerry made the will under improper pressure from Jeff, and brings a lawsuit to challenge it. The court appoints an administrator ad litem to represent Jerry's estate while the lawsuit is in progress. Also known as administrator ad prosequendum, meaning administrator 'during the prosecution.' administrator ad prosequendum See administrator ad litem.administrator cum testamento annexo See administrator with will annexed. administrator de bonis non (DBN) Latin for 'administrator of goods not administered.' This term refers to the person appointed by a probate court to finish probate proceedings when the executor or previous administrator can't finish the job.administrator de bonis non cum testamento annexo (DBNCTA) A baffling title for an administrator appointed by a probate court to take over probate proceedings when the named executor dies, leaving the job unfinished.administrator pendente lite Latin for 'administrator pending litigation.' This term refers to the person appointed by a court to begin probate proceedings during a lawsuit that challenges the will. The administrator pendente lite takes an inventory of the deceased person's property and handles the business affairs of the estate until the dispute is settled. Also called a special administrator.administrator with will annexed An administrator who takes the place of an executor under a will. The administrator steps in either when a will fails to nominate an executor or the named executor is unable to serve. Also called administrator cum testamento annexo or CTA, the Latin version of 'with the will annexed.'

(more...)Latin meaning 'in fear.' This phrase is used to describe provisions in contracts or wills meant to scare a person into complying with the terms of the agreement. For example, a will might state that an heir will forfeit her inheritance if she challenges the validity of the will. Of course, if the will is challenged and found to be invalid, then the clause itself is also invalid and the heir takes whatever she would have inherited if there were no will.

PER STIRPESUnder a will, a method of determining who inherits property when a joint beneficiary has died before the willmaker, leaving living children of his or her own. F... (more...)Under a will, a method of determining who inherits property when a joint beneficiary has died before the willmaker, leaving living children of his or her own. For example, Fred leaves his house jointly to his son Alan and his daughter Julie. But Alan dies before Fred, leaving two young children. If Fred's will states that heirs of a deceased beneficiary are to receive the property 'per stirpes,' Julie will receive one-half of the property, and Alan's two children will share his half in equal shares (through Alan by right of representation). If, on the other hand, Fred's will states that the property is to be divided per capita, Julie and the two grandchildren will each take a third.

GENERATION-SKIPPING TRUSTA trust designed to save on estate tax. The trust principal is preserved for the trust maker's grandchildren, with his or her children receiving only income fro... (more...)A trust designed to save on estate tax. The trust principal is preserved for the trust maker's grandchildren, with his or her children receiving only income from the trust. Because the children (the middle generation) never legally own the property, it isn't subject to estate tax at their death. See generation-skipping transfer tax.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Property ManagementORION Commercial Partners (ORION) provides professional property management services and consulting to all levels of investment groups and owners of commercial real estate. ORION currently manages a significant portfolio of office, retail, industrial and medical office space in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with capacity for new assignments. ORION specializes in personalized management services by providing a customized management plan to fit the specific needs of investors and creates value in real estate for owners and investors through a broad spectrum of property management capabilities, resources and expertise. In every assignment, ORION designs and delivers a scope of services designed to meet each client’s unique investment objectives.Leasing ServicesTenants are the lifeblood of commercial real estate. Without space companies don’t function. Without demand there is no income. Successful leasing support is about creating partnership. ORION Commercial Partners works with your people, or can bring all the pieces of leasing together through our strong network of critical providers including property managers, architects, engineers, and construction contractors.Tenant RepresentationClick here to learn more about our team and for links to our podcast seriesAcquisition/DispositionAre you looking to sell existing assets or acquire your next project? Do you have other investments and seek diversification into real estate? Is ownership of real estate for the operation of your company and for the benefit of your investment portfolio a possibility? We ask many questions, listen carefully, and create a strategy tailored to your needs and circumstances.InvestTailored investment partnerships
Options to invest over the coming years will be plentiful. For many private investors a “blind syndication” or a publicly traded fund with no operational control is not appealing. On the other hand, investing directly can be effective if this is the investor’s core business, the client wants real estate to be a full time occupation, and they have all the local resources required at hand. If you are not one of these veterans or commercial real estate holding companies then you will need an advocate and a partner inside the industry.
