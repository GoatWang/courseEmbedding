Hilary Swank








The ever-growing cast of the NASCAR-set title includes Daniel Craig, Michael Shannon and Katherine Heigl.

Hilary Swank is the latest addition to Steven Soderbergh’s Logan Lucky.
She joins a cast that includes Daniel Craig, Channing Tatum, Michael Shannon, Katherine Heigl and Adam Driver. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and The Girlfriend Experience's Riley Keough will also star.
The heist film stars Tatum and Shannon as brothers who plan a robbery during a high-profile NASCAR race. 
Mark Johnson, Gregory Jacobs and Reid Carolin are producing the film, which is scheduled to begin production in the fall. 
Swank, a two-time Oscar winner, is currently filming the mental illness drama 55 Steps, where she stars opposite Helena Bonham Carter. 
Swank is repped by WME and Jackoway Tyerman.
