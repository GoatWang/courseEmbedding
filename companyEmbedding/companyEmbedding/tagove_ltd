Live chat platform Tagove helps businesses answer customer queries in real time

Tagove is a live chat software that provides video chat, voice calling, and text chat with co-browsing and screen sharing with the customer. Consumers today are not just looking for a seamless experience, but expect a proactive response and a relationship with brands, products or services. There is a need for urgency in terms of response time that consumers look at.It was something that Laduram Vishnoi, Amritpal Dhangal and Sawaram Suthar realised when they started their software and app development companies, Just Total Tech. While working at these companies, they encountered several problems in terms of customer communication.The Tagove team






Solving the response lag timeThey realised that the lead time to response needed to be shorter and there was a need for instant communication. “We came across many ideas that could remove instant communication gap between customers and companies. Though basic chat software was present for a long time, the time taken to solve small customer queries was long,” says Laduram.That’s when the trio felt the need for a product that integrated chat, video, text and voice calling with co-browsing and screen sharing with the customer. They then went on to develop live chat software Tagove in 2015.The idea behind Tagove is to ensure the resolution of customer queries as quickly as possible. This can happen when a customer agent can talk over phone or video and, if need be, even take over a customer’s screen for co-browsing so as to help him instantly rather than downloading all the remote access software.
The team and productAfter running the trial and beta version of the software, the team was able to bring on board a few clients with whom they could partner and launch the software. The platform is sector agnostic and works on e-commerce, SaaS business, financial institutions or any possible marketplace.“At present, we are total 18 people including the development and the sales team. We have four offices worldwide. The headquarters is in San Francisco; the sales office is in London; development, marketing, and support offices are in Ahmedabad,” says Laduram.Speaking of the challenges the team faced, Laduram says the biggest one pertained to how to manage live chat, especially without downloading any third-party software or plugins.
The system provides multi-channel support including text chat, video calling, co-browsing, and screen sharing. It also has VOIP call facility for those who want to call the customers directly. Says Laduram,“After going through intense research work, we have designed our live chat software with the latest technologies. Having seven years of long-term experience in software development, we have learned a lot of new technologies like WebRTC, Node.js which ultimately helped me to set up a product company.”The chat spaceCurrently, the startup ecosystem is witnessing the growth of chat-based customer services. For instance, in the financial services there are robo advisory services that are looking at chat bots, especially for customer care. In China, one of the biggest players is WeChat.
Smartphone users spend a chunk of their time on chat applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook  Messenger, Hike, and WeChat. WhatsApp has one billion monthly active users, Messenger has 800 million, and WeChat 697 million. The limitations with human-based chat is that all agents cannot perform up to the level of best agents.Tagove, however, is different. Compared to the others who provide only basic chat features, Tagove offers video chat, voice calling, co-browsing, and screen sharing all at once. It’s a full-stack customer support software.The team follows a license-based business model and now claims to have over 300 paid customers like Citibank, Citibank, Penske, ICICI pro-life Insurance (India), Amagi (India), Hyundai, Aster Pharmacy (India and UAE), etc. “We are growing at a high rate of 45 percent more paid customers every month,” says Laduram.
Apart from the initial investment from family and friends, Tagove has received funding from 500 Startups, an early-stage venture fund and seed accelerator. The team now claims to be working with artificial intelligence (AI) and Chatbot systems where customers can get help automatically. If AI can’t figure out what customers are asking, then they have the video chat or voice calling options.Website

The next generation co-browsing software – Improving online customer experience.
Today, a major problem for the customer support and assistance teams are facing is to provide seamless customer service which can improve online buying experience. Buyers already know the basics, but they expect some more information during their buying journey. They are looking for such support help which can make them happy.
After years of analysis, Tagove understand the need of customers and introduced the next level co-browsing software. This platform allows you to give a product demo, solve customer query, guide and help customers, and more through same web browser. And most important is the whole process would be encrypted and secured.
This fantastic co-browsing technology allows a support agent to connect to a customer’s browser window, see the customer’s web page and mouse cursor, and interact with the web page in real-time.
From our users, we have seen that they have dramatically reduced online frustration, increases positive customer experience, and lifetime customer loyalty. This all leads customers to attain their satisfaction level in the decided time frame.






Sounds good? Sign-up with Tagove co-browsing today and lead in the direction of offering live solutions to your customer.







With the co-browsing feature, the customer assistant will be able to reach the browsing window of the customer, can interact with them and solve their query at the real time. This sends a positive message to the customer and increases the credibility factor. Now that they don't have to wait on the phone to get an answer, they are more inclined to your company and the ratings for your company ultimately come up.






Some of great co-browsing feature that streamline customer engagement









1. Complete view of agent’s and customer’s screen - Co-browsing is like screen sharing, but it’s limited to the customer browser and is lightning fast. With our co-browsing, you can connect to a customer’s browser instantly and show them the website by highlighting the different elements of a page.
2. Two way interaction – Agent can chat with customers while viewing their screen
3. Run on any devices – Whether you’re on desk or not, it support all devices iPhone, Android,iPad, laptop, PC or Mac.
