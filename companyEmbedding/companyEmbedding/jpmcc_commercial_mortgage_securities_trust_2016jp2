to or for the Underwriters and $4,188,682.96 were other expenses. All of the foregoing expense


 
 
 amounts are the Depositor’s reasonable estimates of such
expenses. No underwriting discounts and commissions or finder’s fees were paid by the Registrant; the Public Certificates
were offered by the Underwriters for sale to the public in negotiated transactions or otherwise at varying prices determined at
the time of sale. The related registration statement (file no. 333-206361) was originally declared effective on November 20, 2015.
On July 29, 2016, the
Registrant sold the Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class NR and Class R Certificates (collectively, the “Private
Certificates”), having an aggregate initial principal amount of $115,051,708 to JPMS and DBSI, as initial purchasers,
pursuant to a Certificate Purchase Agreement, dated July 8, 2016, by and among the Depositor, JPMS and DBSI (the “Certificate
Purchase Agreement”). The Private Certificates were sold in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act.
The Certificates represent,
in the aggregate, the entire beneficial ownership in JPMCC Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP2 (the “Issuing
Entity”), a common law trust fund formed under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. The assets of the Issuing Entity consist primarily of 47 fixed-rate mortgage loans (the “Mortgage Loans”)
secured by first liens on 78 commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing properties. The Mortgage Loans were acquired by the
Registrant (i) from JPMCB pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2016 and as to which an executed
version is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, between the Registrant and JPMCB, (ii) from Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance
LLC (“BSP”) pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2016 and as to which an executed
version is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2, between the Registrant, BSP and Benefit Street Partners CRE Conduit Company,
L.P., (iii) from German American Capital Corporation (“GACC”) pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement,
dated as of July 29, 2016 and as to which an executed version is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3, between the Registrant
and GACC and (iv) from Starwood Mortgage Funding VI LLC (“SMF VI”) pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement,
dated as of July 29, 2016 and as to which an executed version is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.4, between the Registrant,
SMF VI and Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC.
The funds used by
the Registrant to pay the purchase price for the Mortgage Loans were derived in part from the proceeds from the sale of Certificates
by the Registrant to the Underwriters, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to the Certificate
Purchase Agreement.
The Public Certificates
and the Mortgage Loans are more particularly described in the Prospectus dated July 11, 2016 and as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on July 29, 2016. In connection with such Prospectus, the Chief Executive Officer of the Registrant has provided
the certification attached hereto as Exhibit 36.1.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
