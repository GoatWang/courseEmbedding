RIDGEWOOD ENERGY O FUND LLC - 10-K - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONSOverview of the Fund's Business The Fund was organized primarily to acquire interests in oil and gas properties located in
the United States
offshore waters of
Texas
,
Louisiana
and
Alabama
in the Gulf of Mexico. The Fund's primary investment objective is to generate cash flow for distribution to its shareholders by generating returns across a portfolio of exploratory or development oil and natural gas projects. However, the Fund is not required to make distributions to shareholders except as provided in the LLC Agreement.
The Manager performs, or arranges for the performance of, the management, advisory and administrative services required for Fund operations. The Fund does not currently, nor is there any plan to, operate any project in which the Fund participates. The Manager enters into operating agreements with third-party operators for the management of all exploration, development and producing operations, as appropriate. See Item 1. "Business" of this Annual Report under the headings "Project Information" and "Properties" for more information regarding the projects of the Fund.
Commodity Price Changes Changes in commodity prices may significantly affect liquidity and expected operating results. Reductions in oil and gas prices not only reduce revenues and profits, but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Significant declines in prices could result in non-cash charges to earnings due to impairment.
Since fourth quarter 2014, there has been a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices. See "Results of Operations" under this Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report for more information on the average oil and natural gas prices received by the Fund during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the effect of such decreased average prices on the Fund's results of operations. If oil and natural gas prices continue to decline, even if only for a short period of time, the Fund's results of operations and liquidity will continue to be adversely impacted.
Market pricing for oil and natural gas is volatile, and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. This volatility is caused by numerous factors and market conditions that the Fund cannot control or influence. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the future price of oil and natural gas with any certainty. Factors affecting market pricing for oil and natural gas include:

                               · weather conditions;


       · economic conditions, including demand for petroleum-based products;


       · actions by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;


  · political instability in the 

Middle East

 and other major oil and gas producing
    regions;

Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the Fund's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Fund's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America
("GAAP"). In preparing these financial statements, the Fund is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the Fund's assets and liabilities, including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of its revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The Fund evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The Fund bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that the Fund believes to be reasonable at the time the estimates and assumptions are made. However, future events and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions and such differences may have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See Note 1 of "Notes to Financial Statements" - "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" contained in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" within this Annual Report for a discussion of the Fund's significant accounting policies. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most significant.
Accounting for Exploration, Development and Acquisition Costs Exploration, development and acquisition costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and natural gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers' fees and other related costs are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells and related production facilities are capitalized. Annual lease rentals and exploration expenses are expensed as incurred.
Proved Reserves Estimates of proved reserves are key components of the Fund's most significant financial estimates involving its rate for recording depletion and amortization. Annually, the Fund engages an independent petroleum engineer to perform a comprehensive study of the Fund's proved properties to determine the quantities of reserves and the period over which such reserves will be recoverable. The Fund's estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. However, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues, rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the Fund's control. The estimation process is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. In addition, as a result of volatility and changing market conditions, commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period, causing estimates of proved reserves and future net revenues to change.
Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations include costs to plug and abandon the Fund's wells and to dismantle and relocate or dispose of the Fund's production platforms and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. The Fund develops estimates of these costs based upon the type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, ongoing discussions with the wells' operators and, at times, with information provided by third-party abandonment consultants specializing in the oil and gas industry. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires significant judgment that is subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. Estimates are reviewed on a bi-annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs that would dictate a change in assumptions or estimates.

Table of Contents
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Fund reviews the value of its oil and gas properties annually and when management determines that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable. Impairments of proved properties are determined by comparing estimated future net undiscounted cash flows from the property to the carrying value at the time of the review. If the carrying value exceeds estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the property is written down to fair value, which is determined using estimated future net discounted cash flows from the property. The fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. Different pricing assumptions, reserve estimates or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment. Given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Fund's estimate of net discounted future cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term. Significant declines in oil and natural gas prices since fourth quarter 2014 have resulted in impairments of oil and gas properties. If oil and natural gas prices continue to decline, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional impairments of oil and gas properties will occur.

Overview. The following table provides information related to the Fund's oil and gas production and oil and gas revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. NGL sales are included within gas sales.

                                                  Year ended December 31,
                                                  2015               2014

        Total number of production days              1,785              1,659
        Oil sales (in thousands of barrels)             69                 36
        Average oil price per barrel          $         47       $         93
        Gas sales (in thousands of mcfs)               275                266
        Average gas price per mcf             $       2.47       $       4.71



During the year ended December 31, 2015, production days and sales volumes were impacted by the commencement of production of four wells in the Marmalard Project and one well in the Diller Project, partially offset by the Liberty and South Pelto 9 projects, which were shut-in during fourth quarter 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Alpha Project reached the end of its productive life. See Item 1. "Business" of this Annual Report under the heading "Properties" for more information.

Oil and Gas Revenue. The Fund generally sells oil, gas and NGLs under two types of agreements, which are common in the oil and gas industry. Both types of agreements may include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which the Fund sells oil and gas at the wellhead and receives a price, net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser. In this case, the Fund records revenue at the net price received from the purchaser. The second type of agreement is one whereby the Fund pays transportation expense directly. In that case, transportation expense is included within operating expense in the statements of operations.
Oil and gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4.0 million, a decrease of $0.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to decreased oil and gas prices totaling $3.7 million, partially offset by increased sales volume totaling $3.0 million. See "Overview" above for factors that impact the oil and gas revenue sales volume and rate variances.
Depletion and Amortization. Depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million, an increase of $0.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was attributable to increases in production volumes totaling $0.4 million and the average depletion rate of $0.2 million, coupled with adjustments to asset retirement obligations of $0.2 million, related to the Alpha Project, a fully depleted property. The increase in the average depletion rate was primarily attributable to the onset of production of the Diller and Marmalard projects, which have higher cost reserves. See "Overview" above for certain factors that impact the depletion and amortization volume and rate variances. Depletion and amortization rates are also impacted by changes in reserve estimates provided annually by the Fund's independent petroleum engineers.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund recorded impairments of oil and gas properties of $0.3 million, related to Eugene Island 346/347 and the Cobalt Project, which were attributable to both declines in future oil and gas prices and revisions to reserve estimates as provided by the Fund's independent petroleum engineers. The Fund did not record any impairments of oil and gas properties during the year ended December 31, 2014.
Management Fees to Affiliate. An annual management fee, totaling 2.5% of total capital contributions, net of cumulative dry-hole and related well costs incurred by the Fund, is paid monthly to the Manager.
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses represent costs specifically identifiable or allocable to the Fund's wells, as detailed in the following table.

                                             Year ended December 31,
                                             2015               2014

              Transportation expense              153                  -
              Accretion expense                    94                 41
              Dry-hole costs and other             54                135
                                         $      2,506       $      1,022



Lease operating expense and transportation expense relates to the Fund's producing properties. Insurance expense represents premiums related to producing well and control of well insurance, which varies depending upon the number of wells producing or drilling. Insurance expense related to operating wells has been reclassified from "General and administrative expenses" in prior year to "Operating expenses" to correct prior period presentation. The average production cost, which includes lease operating expense, transportation expense and insurance expense, was $20.59 per barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE") during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $9.69 per BOE during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is principally attributable to the impact of costs associated with the commencement of production for the Marmalard and Diller projects. Accretion expense relates to the asset retirement obligations established for the Fund's proved properties. Dry-hole costs are those costs incurred to drill and develop a well that is ultimately found to be incapable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion of the well. At times, the Fund receives adjustments to certain wells from their respective operators upon review and audit of the wells' costs.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses represent costs specifically identifiable or allocable to the Fund, such as accounting and professional fees and directors' and officers' liability insurance expense.

Dividend Income. Dividend income is related to the Fund's investment in Delta House. See Note 1 of "Notes to Financial Statements" - "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" contained in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" within this Annual Report for more information regarding the Investment in Delta House.
Interest Income. Interest income is comprised of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and salvage fund.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Operating Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.2 million, related to revenue received of $3.8 million and dividend income received of $0.1 million, partially offset by operating expenses of $2.2 million, management fees of $1.4 million and general and administrative expenses of $0.1 million.
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.4 million, related to revenue received of $4.9 million, partially offset by management fees of $1.5 million, operating expenses of $0.9 million and general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million.
Investing Cash Flows Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.3 million related to capital expenditures for oil and gas properties and investment in Delta House of $14.0 million, and investments in the salvage fund of $0.3 million. See Note 1 of "Notes to Financial Statements" - "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" contained in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" within this Annual Report for more information regarding the Investment in Delta House.
Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $12.2 million, related to capital expenditures for oil and gas properties and investment in Delta House of $11.7 million, inclusive of advances, coupled with investments in the salvage fund of $0.5 million.
Financing Cash Flows Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $16.0 million, related to proceeds from long-term borrowings of $16.2 million, partially offset by manager and shareholder distributions totaling $0.2 million.
Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $5.1 million, related to proceeds from long-term borrowings of $6.6 million, partially offset by manager and shareholder distributions totaling $1.5 million.
Estimated Capital Expenditures
The Fund has entered into multiple agreements for the acquisition, drilling and development of its oil and gas properties. The estimated capital expenditures associated with these agreements vary depending on the stage of development on a property-by-property basis. As of December 31, 2015, the Fund had three properties, the Beta, Diller and Marmalard projects, for which additional development costs must be incurred. The Fund currently expects to spend an additional $19.4 million (which includes asset retirement obligations) related to the development of these projects, which the Fund anticipates will include the development of twelve wells, four in the Beta Project, two in the Diller Project and six in the Marmalard Project, with related platform and pipeline infrastructure. During 2015, one well in the Diller Project and four wells in the Marmalard Project commenced production. See Item 1. "Business" of this Annual Report under the heading "Properties" for additional information. See "Liquidity Needs" below for additional information.
Capital expenditures for oil and gas properties have been funded with the capital raised by the Fund in its private placement offering, and in certain circumstances, through debt financing. The number of projects in which the Fund could invest was limited, and each unsuccessful project the Fund experienced exhausted its capital and reduced its ability to generate revenue.
Liquidity Needs
The Fund's primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund its operations and capital expenditures for its oil and gas properties. Such needs are funded utilizing operating income, existing cash on-hand and borrowings.



                                       16

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2015, the Fund's estimated capital commitments related to its oil and gas properties were $21.8 million (which include asset retirement obligations for the Fund's projects of $5.9 million and projected interest costs of $1.0 million for the Beta Project), of which $9.7 million is expected to be spent during the year ending December 31, 2016. These expected capital commitments exceed available working capital and salvage fund by $15.8 million at December 31, 2015. The Fund has entered into a credit agreement to provide capital for the Beta Project. See "Credit Agreement" below for additional information.
Based upon its current cash position, its current reserve estimates and its current development plan of the Beta Project, the Fund expects cash flow from operations and borrowings to be sufficient to cover its commitments, as well as ongoing operations. Reserve estimates are projections based on engineering data that cannot be measured with precision, require substantial judgment, and are subject to frequent revision. However, if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet the Fund's capital requirements, the Manager will take action, which may include adjusting its management fee temporarily to accommodate the Fund's short-term capital requirements.
The Manager is entitled to receive an annual management fee from the Fund regardless of the Fund's profitability in that year.
Distributions, if any, are funded from available cash from operations, as defined in the LLC Agreement, and the frequency and amount are within the Manager's discretion. Due to the significant capital required to develop the Beta, Diller and Marmalard projects, distributions have been impacted, and will be impacted in the future, by amounts reserved to provide for their ongoing development costs, debt service costs, and funding their estimated asset retirement obligations.
Credit Agreement In November 2012, the Fund entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Rahr Energy Investments LLC, as administrative agent and lender (and any other banks or financial institutions that may in the future become a party thereto), that provides for an aggregate loan commitment to the Fund of approximately $24.1 million to provide capital toward the funding of the Fund's share of development costs on the Beta Project. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Fund had borrowed $22.8 million and $6.6 million, respectively, under the Credit Agreement. Principal and interest amounts are contracted to be repaid upon the onset of production of the Beta Project, which is expected in third quarter 2016, over a period not to extend beyond December 31, 2020. The Fund expects operating income from the Beta Project will be sufficient to cover the principal and interest payments required under the Credit Agreement. See Note 3 of "Notes to Financial Statements" - "Credit Agreement - Beta Project Financing" contained in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" within this Annual Report for more information regarding the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants including covenants that limit the Fund's ability to, among other things, grant liens, change the nature of its business, or merge into or consolidate with other persons. The events which constitute events of default are also customary for credit facilities of this nature and include payment defaults, breaches of representations, warrants and covenants, insolvency and change of control. Upon the occurrence of a default, in some cases following a notice and cure period, the Lenders under the Credit Agreement may accelerate the maturity of the Loan and require full and immediate repayment of all borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Fund believes it is in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Fund had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and does not anticipate the use of such arrangements in the future.
Contractual Obligations
The Fund enters into participation and joint operating agreements with operators. On behalf of the Fund, an operator enters into various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. The Fund does not negotiate such contracts. No contractual obligations exist at December 31, 2015 and 2014, other than those discussed in "Estimated Capital Expenditures" and "Liquidity Needs - Credit Agreement" above.

Ridgewood Energy Closes Latest Fund At $1.1 Billion

		  Fund Focused on Deepwater Oil Exploration and Production
		

Jan 13, 2014, 09:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Ridgewood Energy Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


MONTVALE, N.J. and HOUSTON, Jan. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corp. ("Ridgewood Energy" or "Ridgewood"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Montvale, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas, has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil and Gas Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II"), with total commitments of $1.1 billion, reaching its hard cap.  The Fund, which had an original target amount of $750 million, has been formed by Ridgewood to invest in exploration and production of oil projects in the U.S. deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
Fund II is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on generating superior risk adjusted returns for investors by drilling and developing high-potential new oil fields.
The Fund's commitments were sourced from 39 institutional investors, including a number of leading state and union pension plans, well-known university endowments and foundations, and a number of Fund of Funds, private wealth managers and family offices.
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President, said, "Our focused investment strategy, coupled with disciplined execution, has demonstrated the potential to generate enormous value for our funds' limited partners.  We aim to continue delivering on that strategy for our Fund II LPs."
Fund II has already invested in two oil wells, one of which, the Dantzler Project, was drilled in partnership with Noble Energy Inc. (NYSE:   NBL) and resulted in an oil discovery (see Noble Energy Press Release).
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood's Founder and Chairman said, "We are extremely pleased with the strong reception to our latest private equity fund, which we believe reflects the growing importance sophisticated investors place on focused, value-added investment strategies executed by a specialized team of professionals with deep, industry-specific knowledge."   
Robert Gold, Senior Managing Director of Ridgewood, said, "We particularly appreciated receiving strong support from a diverse set of institutional investors with significant expertise in energy.  Fund II provided these investors with targeted asset-class exposure, along with the potential to deliver true alpha."
Ridgewood's $1.1 billion in commitments secured by Fund II comes in addition to $700 million in capital and commitments Ridgewood currently manages on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, ("Riverstone") the energy-focused private equity firm, through entities known as ILX Holdings I, LLC and ILX Holdings II, LLC (which are affiliates of Riverstone's two most recent private equity funds).  
Eaton Partners, LLC, based in Rowayton, CT, acted as placement agent for the fund.  Vinson & Elkins LLP, served as fund counsel.
About Ridgewood Energy
Ridgewood Energy Corporation manages private investment funds that drill and develop oil and gas projects in the U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  With its strategic focus in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Ridgewood Energy and its partners seek to develop and produce new oil and gas reserves with multi-billion dollar revenue potential.  Ridgewood's team of energy-industry professionals brings extensive operating, technical, and geological expertise to all stages of the investment process, from project evaluation and selection through drilling, development, and production.
