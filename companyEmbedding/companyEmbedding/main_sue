What is Product Liability? 






 Download article as a PDF










Defective or dangerous products are the cause of thousands of injuries every year in the U.S. "Product liability law," the legal rules concerning who is responsible for defective or dangerous products, is different from ordinary injury law, and this set of rules sometimes makes it easier for an injured person to recover damages.
Product liability refers to a manufacturer or seller being held liable for placing a defective product into the hands of a consumer. Responsibility for a product defect that causes injury lies with all sellers of the product who are in the distribution chain. In general terms, the law requires that a product meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer. When a product has an unexpected defect or danger, the product cannot be said to meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer.
There is no federal product liability law. Typically, product liability claims are based on state laws, and brought under the theories of negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty. In addition, a set of commercial statutes in each state, modeled on the Uniform Commercial Code, will contain warranty rules affecting product liability.
Responsible Parties
For product liability to arise, at some point the product must have been sold in the marketplace. Historically, a contractual relationship, known as "privity of contract," had to exist between the person injured by a product and the supplier of the product in order for the injured person to recover. In most states today, however, that requirement no longer exists, and the injured person does not have to be the purchaser of the product in order to recover. Any person who foreseeably could have been injured by a defective product can recover for his or her injuries, as long as the product was sold to someone.
Liability for a product defect could rest with any party in the product's chain of distribution, such as:

The product manufacturer;

A manufacturer of component parts;
A party that assembles or installs the product;

The wholesaler; and

The retail store that sold the product to the consumer.

For strict liability to apply, the sale of a product must be made in the regular course of the supplier's business. Thus, someone who sells a product at a garage sale would probably not be liable in a product liability action.
Types of Product Defects
Under any theory of liability, a plaintiff in a product liability case must prove that the product that caused injury was defective, and that the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous. There are three types of defects that might cause injury and give rise to manufacturer or supplier liability:

Design Defects - Present in a product from the beginning, even before it is manufactured, in that something in the design of the product is inherently unsafe.
Manufacturing Defects - Those that occur in the course of a product's manufacture or assembly.
Marketing Defects - Flaws in the way a product is marketed, such as improper labeling, insufficient instructions, or inadequate safety warnings.

Who's Responsible?

The doctrine known as "res ipsa loquitur" shifts the burden of proof in some product liability cases to the defendant(s). Translated, this Latin term means "the thing speaks for itself," and indicates that the defect at issue would not exist unless someone was negligent. If the doctrine is successfully invoked, the plaintiff is no longer required to prove how the defendant was negligent; rather, the defendant is required to prove that it was not negligent.
The second rule that helps plaintiffs in product liability cases is that of strict liability. If strict liability applies, the plaintiff does not need to prove that a manufacturer was negligent, but only that the product was defective. By eliminating the issue of manufacturer fault, the concept of no-fault, or "strict" liability allows plaintiffs to recover where they otherwise might not.
See Proving Fault in a Product Liability Case to learn more.
Unavoidably Unsafe Products
By their nature, some products simply cannot be made safer without losing their usefulness. For example, an electric knife that is too dull to injure anyone would also be useless for its intended purpose. It is generally believed that, as to such products, users and consumers are the best equipped to minimize risk. Thus, while a product might not be deemed unreasonably dangerous, manufacturers and suppliers of unavoidably unsafe products must give proper warnings of the dangers and risks of their products so that consumers can make informed decisions regarding
Common Defenses to Product Liability Claims
A defense often raised in product liability cases is that the plaintiff has not sufficiently identified the supplier of the product that allegedly caused the injury. A plaintiff must be able to connect the product with the party(ies) responsible for manufacturing or supplying it. There is an exception to this rule, known as the "market share liability" exception, which applies in cases involving defective medications. Where a plaintiff cannot identify which of the pharmaceutical companies that supply a particular drug supplied the drug he/she took, each manufacturer will be held liable according to its percentage of sales in the area where the injury occurred.
Another defense a manufacturer might raise is that the plaintiff substantially altered the product after it left the manufacturer's control, and this alteration caused the plaintiff's injury. A related defense is that the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable way, and that his/her misuse of the product cause the injuries alleged.

Product Liability 
Dangerous and defective products cause thousands of injuries every year in the U.S. These products include all sorts of consumer goods, running the gamut from children's products to consumer electronics and vehicles. Product liability laws are based on the the premise that companies generally have a duty to protect consumers from potential hazards. Courts have held that manufacturers generally have more insight and knowledge about their products, so it falls to them to assume financial responsibility for any injuries or damage they cause. An Ordinary Consumer's Expectations Product liability laws vary from state to state and they differ from ordinary personal injury laws, with their own set of rules and procedures. These laws provide the victims of dangerous products with legal recourse for injuries suffered. A product is typically required to meet the ordinary expectations of a consumer. When a product has an unexpected defect or danger, the product cannot be said to meet those expectations. Depending on the type of defect, any number of different parties may be held liable for the injuries caused by a defective product. Types of Product Defects There are three types of defects that might cause injury and give rise to manufacturer or supplier liability: design defects, manufacturing defects, and marketing defects. Design defects are present in a product from the beginning, even before it is manufactured. Here, something in the design of the product is inherently unsafe. Manufacturing defects occur in the course of a product's manufacture or assembly. Finally, marketing defects are flaws in the way a product is marketed, such as improper labeling, insufficient instructions, or inadequate safety warnings. Defenses to Product Liability Claims One defense often raised in product liability cases is that the plaintiff has not sufficiently identified the supplier of the identified product. A plaintiff must be able to connect the product with the party or parties responsible for manufacturing or supplying it. Another defense is that the plaintiff substantially altered the product after it left the manufacturer's control, and this alteration caused the plaintiff's injury. A related defense is that the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable way, and that his/her misuse of the product cause the injuries. Product Liability Lawyers Product liability actions are often quite complex, and establishing legal fault can require the assistance and testimony of experts. There are several theories under which a plaintiff might bring a claim, as well as defenses that might defeat such a claim.  In addition, every state has its own laws and specific statutes that will affect a product liability action. Accordingly, it is important to consult an experienced attorney if you or a loved one suffers injury caused by a potentially defective product.

Cosmetic Product Injury Lawsuits


by Coulter Boeschen 



Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook





















Injuries from cosmetic products can come in a wide variety of forms -- from allergic reactions to infections and other complications. There are two main legal theories that a person injured by a cosmetic product (the plaintiff) could sue under: product liability and breach of warranty. This article discusses what a plaintiff in a cosmetic injury suit must prove under either theory, cases specifically related to allergic reactions, and the possibility of class action lawsuits.
Product Liability: The Basics
The most likely theory to be used in a lawsuit involving cosmetic product injuries is product liability. An injured plaintiff can sue both the manufacturer and/or the seller (the defendant) of the cosmetic product if his or her injury was caused by a defect, a defective design or improper labeling. Most states follow what is called the “strict product liability” rule, although a few still use traditional negligence rules.
A plaintiff suing under a strict liability theory simply needs to prove:

that he or she was the kind of consumer that the defendant intended to use the product
that the defect did not occur after the product was sold, and
that the plaintiff was injured.

This kind of theory is called "strict liability" because many of the requirements in a standard negligence case, like proof of a specific duty of care owed to the plaintiff, are not included. Most states adopted strict liability for mass-marketed consumer products because, among other things, the manufacturers needed to be financially responsible for their products, and not be allowed to escape liability simply because of the difficulty plaintiffs faced trying to prove negligence claims.
In a negligence case (in those few states that still use this theory for consumer products), the plaintiff will need to prove:

that he or she bought the product from the defendant
that the defendant should have known that the product could be dangerous if unaccompanied by proper warnings, or that the product had a defect
that the failure to warn the plaintiff, or the defect or defective design, injured the plaintiff, and
that the plaintiff didn’t do anything to cause the injury.

Breach of Warranty
A cosmetic product injury case based on a breach of warranty theory will be the same as other standardbreach of warranty cases.
An injured plaintiff could sue for breach of an express warranty if the seller or manufacturer made specific guarantees that a product would have specific effects that the product did not have (note that this theory might not fit with most cases involving an actual injury).
The plaintiff could also sue for breach of an implied warranty that the cosmetic product was fit for normal use, i.e. the implied guarantee that no normal cosmetic product would cause an injury if used properly.
Finally, the plaintiff could sue for breach of an implied warranty that the product was fit for a specific purpose, i.e. that the defendant knew the plaintiff wanted to use the product for a specific purpose, but the product caused an injury when the plaintiff tried use it.
There are many state and federal laws controlling breach of warranty claims. Some breach of warranty claims may not be appropriate when the plaintiff is suing for physical injuries, if the law only allows compensation for the money lost on the product (what is called “economic damages”).
Some warranty laws, however, do allow a plaintiff to sue for physical injuries. Perhaps more importantly, proving a breach of warranty can help prove a strict liability or negligence claim. A plaintiff is not limited to suing under one theory, so including a breach of warranty claim in a cosmetic injury lawsuit will generally help a plaintiff's case overall.
Injuries Caused by Allergies
If a manufacturer knows, or should know, that a product might cause an allergic reaction in some people, injured plaintiffs could potentially sue the manufacturer for failing to warn about the allergic reaction under a strict liability or negligence theory. A breach of warranty theory might also be possible if the allergic reaction is not extremely rare, i.e. the product was not fit for cosmetic use because some percentage of the population was allergic.
Class Actions for Cosmetic Product Injuries
If a cosmetic product causes many or all of its users the same kind of injury, then a class action may be possible. In a class action case, multiple plaintiffs with the same kind of injury from the same source sue the defendant in one lawsuit.
If someone is injured by a cosmetic product, they or their attorney should research whether there is already a class action case or a settlement fund for people injured by the product. Often, even though the case has settled, there will be a fund to pay those who were not a part of the original case.

QUORA: Why is having biological children usually a couple's first choice, rather than adopting a newborn?


My answer to a question about adoption on Quora: Q: Why is having biological children usually a couple's first choice, rather than adopting a newborn? My Answer: Because the adoption process is: Potentially very long & uncertain. You might not get matched to a child for years, or maybe you'll »





Yes, Product Manager, you too can (help) acquire companies


Let's say that you're a junior-ish Product Manager.  Your product is NOT killing it (not yet, anyway). You have stiff competition.  Your product is missing key capabilities that the market demands  -- perhaps because this technology looks to fundamentally disrupt your product's market or because a competitor already (or imminently) »





The (ahem) "Art" of Pricing


Originally published in 2010.  Updated and republished in May, 2015. A reader asks: "Can you please enlighten me on the art of pricing?" At the risk of misinterpreting, I believe the reader is asking specifically about enterprise software, where price lists are usually secret, transaction volumes are relatively low, and »





A Dangerous Combination: Sales People and the External Product Roadmap


This is my youngest son.  He's 4 years old and is a total goober.  Let's call him "J". J is probably going to be a sales person when he grows up.  He is extroverted, charming, funny, naturally positive, and when he wants something he goes after it  with dogged persistence »





How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Sinister Sales Engineer


Ah, the Sinister Sales Engineer. Many companies have one. Early in my career, when I was not even a "Senior" Product Manager yet, this guy scared the bejeezus out of me. Let's just say that this guy was from the Bronx and had an, ahem, "way with words." Especially four-letter »





Lessons I Learned from Co-Founding a Tech Startup


Once upon a time, when I was a wee lass (25 years old, to be precise), and not yet a product manager but a code warrior-ess (or whatever it is that you call female warriors), I did that clichéd, hackneyed Silicon Valley stunt: co-founding a tech startup with three other »





Quora: Options for adopting from abroad as a single woman


I answered the following question on international adoption on Quora:  Q: I'm a single female in my 40s, and would like to adopt a child internationally. Which countries should I be considering? I'm based in UK, but for various reasons I'd like to considering international options. Russia has recently blocked »





Quora: Is it fair for men & women to have different criteria for Y-Combinator, MIT & Caltech?


Summarized from a discussion I had in the comments on Quora. Original Question: How could Y Combinator be more female-friendly? This isn't so much about how YC treats women once they get in, but about ways to balance the gender ratio. The Discussion One answerer suggested setting up processes that »





Why Product Management is so misunderstood


I've encountered lots of software startups that want to start up a Product Management function, even though they don't really understand what the Product Management role is or its activities. (I guess that's why they ask for my help).  I've learned this is really common. Software is full of people »





What is Product Management? (the core, the over-extended, and the totally dysfunctional)


Sometimes I help companies (usually startups) kickstart their Product Management function. These companies often know they WANT Product Management, even though they often don't have a clear idea of what Product Managers actually do. In another post, I speculate about why this widespread ignorance of Product Management exists.  But for »





Quora: A parent's love for adoptive children vs biological children


Originally posted to Quora. The original question was "Do parents love biological children more than adopted children?"  Someone who was a biological father without adopted children, who was therefore speculating, posted:   ...I think that we derive a certain fulfillment and gratification from natural children that we don't get from adopted »





Quora: How should paternity leave be arranged for a gay man with an adopted child?


Orignally posted to Quora. Q: How should paternity leave be arranged for a gay man with an adopted child? Should he get paternity leave, which is usually shorter, or maternity leave? If he gets maternity leave, doesn't this suggest he is the 'mother' in the relationship, which is offensive to »





Battlecards - Cheat Sheets on Your Competition.  (A Template)


Sales people are known for having a short-attention span -- they are always focused on the needs of their in-progress deals. Many won't put in the time to learn all about the competition until they absolutely need to. So, you need a way to get them up-to-speed on the competition »





Quora:  What do MIT admissions interviewers look for?


My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: What do MIT admissions interviewers look for?   My Answer I used to interview applicants to MIT, and the biggest things I looked for were: Deep intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning that goes far beyond the norm. This was best demonstrated by »





Escalations: What to do when product issues are critically affecting a customer


What do you do when you have an important customer who is experiencing serious issues with your software -- issues so serious that they can't successfully use the product?   I'm not talking about customers who need a little hand-holding and training. Customer Support can handle them.  I'm talking about situations »





Presenting Your Product Strategy: Tell A Story.

Many PMs also use product strategy templates and checklists.(See footnote »





Quora:  If you are an adoptive parent, do you celebrate your child's 'gotcha day'?


My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: If you are an adoptive parent, do you celebrate your child's 'gotcha day'or 'homecoming day'? If yes, how do you do it? My Answer: We don't.  The main reason is that, for both of my kids, this day would either be really close »





Quora: What illnesses may disqualify someone from adopting a child internationally?


My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: What illnesses may disqualify someone from adopting a child internationally? If one of parents has a history of cancer and doctors said < 1% of its coming back, may the family apply to adopt a child? My Answer: This varies according to the »





Cartoon: Product Roadmap Fail


A new, original cartoon for your enjoyment.  Inspired by countless product roadmap presentations that I have slept through  over the years. (TIP: Telling customers & prospects about features that are not for them or that they don't care about undermines their confidence in your product.  They'll think you're not focused »





Quora: Is a product manager responsible for product documentation?


My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: Is a product manager responsible for product documentation?      My Answer: Product managers are typically responsible for the "whole product" -- which means the product itself, documentation, packaging, pricing, positioning and sometimes also the promotion of those products.  But being responsible for documentation does »





How Los Gatos elementary schools feed into middle and high schools

Quora: Why should I remove features that are not popular?

My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: From a purely financial standpoint is it more expensive to have twins? Or two single pregnancies 1-2 years apart?

My answer, originally published on Quora. Q:  What level of coding experience should a good product manager have?   My Answer Caveat: I'm assuming we are talking about software products.

My answer, originally published on Quora. Q: Infertility: Do you think that using IVF, IUI, or other artificial forms of reproduction is selfish?

To James: You're becoming a very sweet boy


Dear James (age 3.5), You are a very sweet young boy, and I am so touched by how much well you care for others and help them when they need you. Over the weekend, you and Kian were playing in the sprinklers while I tried to test them out »





The day after the last day of 2nd grade (Kian)


Dear Kian, Thursday was the last day of 2nd grade for you, so we spent Friday together doing "special time." First, you played with James a little bit in the morning. Then we took him to daycare so he wouldn't miss "water play day."  You and I came home and »





Quora: What are your feelings towards your adopted child?

Growing Pains (for Mom)

The Value of an MBA in Product Management


A question from a reader: Q: Is an MBA necessary to advance in Product Management to the Senior level, Director level, or beyond? Or can one compensate for the lack of a Masters with strong analytics and high-level strategy and presentation skills? A: I'm originally from Boston, a city known »





Why you need a Product Strategy (even if your boss doesn't care)


I read too many blogs that say "ALL product managers should do X". Having worked with so many companies, I can usually think of plenty of cases where it makes sense to break the  "rule." But despite my distaste for such posts, I'm just gonna do it.  I'm going to »





Quora: Can you push out a founder before stock is issued?

Quora: Why aren't there more female programmers?

Common Product Management Screw-ups That Strike Even the Experienced

Market interviews GONE BAD (ooh, with comics!)

The Economics: NoSQL vs "New SQL" vs Relational Databases


Economics are a big deal when deciding whether to go with a NoSQL, NewSQL, MPP DBMS, or traditional RDBMS.

	Products Liability is a field of tort law which concerns the responsibility of the manufacturer or vendor of a product to ensure that products are safe and do not cause injury.

	Products subjected to liability include all consumer goods, medical devices, commercial/personal vehicles, aircraft and consumable goods such as food and prescription drugs. As it is the duty of a product vendor or manufacturer to produce/supply a product which will not cause harm during normal use, manufacturer/vendors of unsafe products are subject to recovery for damages. Contact a product liability lawyer to consult your case.

Theories of Recovery: 

	Theories of Recovery are the principals upon which a customer may seek compensation for injuries or inconveniences resulting from their use of an unsafe product.  When seeking recovery, the buyer must present cause of action for tort, which may be from bodily injury, property damage, or pain and suffering resulting from the intended use of an unsafe or defective product.  Three theories of legal recovery under product liability law are Recovery under Manufacturer's Defect, Recovery under Insufficient/Unclear warnings or instructions, and Recovery under Design Defect.

Types of Losses: 

	Product liability losses resulting from defect may net economic loss compensation for the buyer or victim of harm.  While physical injuries resulting from contact or use of a defective product usually are filed as negligence tort, the pain and suffering incurred in the aftermath of those injuries may also be filed for as Intangible Economic Losses.  Products with defects also may be held in breach of warranty if normal uses reveals a manufacturing defect, or if the product cannot be used to fulfill its intended purpose.

Negligence & Liability for Physical Harm:

	The proof of negligence in tort law requires that the plaintiff assert error or neglect on behalf of the seller to render safe, usable products to the market. Sellers engaged in business of product sale must deliver a functioning product that is not "unreasonably dangerous" during normal use.  Product buyers who are harmed physically or suffer property damage from defects may sue for product negligence.

Meaning of Dangerously Defective or Unsafe Products:

	In product liability tort, a vendor may be liable for prosecution if the product is Dangerously Defective or Unsafe. A defective product is defined as a product which is unreasonably dangerous to the user when used for its intended purpose without any interference. Victims of injury resulting from the use of unsafe products with defects may be entitled to sue as tort for damages.  If the product can be proven as defective or unsafe, the plaintiff may claim damages from physical injuries, property damage, and pain and suffering from the like.

Contributory Negligence, Misuse, and other Intervening Misconduct: 

	Contributory Negligence, Misuse and Intervening Misconduct are forms of defense to torts of negligence.  When a plaintiff claims product liability in tort, the vendor may allege that there was fault on behalf of the buyer which negates the original claim.

	If a defendant successfully raises a contributory negligence, misuse or intervening misconduct, he or she is not liable for the original tort. Contributory Negligence is negligent behavior on behalf of the plaintiff which contributes or is the cause of the damages claimed in tort. Misuse is use of the product in question for anything other than its intended purpose.  Intervening Misconduct is any interference by a third party which may be to blame for the damages in tort. 

Proof:

	In product liability tort, the burden of proof can vary case by case.  This is generally due to the fact that there are many claims and counter-claims available for the plaintiff and defendant of a product liability lawsuit, each with their respective burden of proof.
	In such torts, the plaintiff is tasked normally tasked with finding fault with the defendant's product, while the defense is tasked with attributing blame for the injury to the plaintiff's negligence or misuse.  Generally, for every theory of recovery in products liability, there is an appropriate standard defense.  Product liability is a well-rehearsed field of tort, and is more tightly-constructed than other fields of personal injury and tort.
