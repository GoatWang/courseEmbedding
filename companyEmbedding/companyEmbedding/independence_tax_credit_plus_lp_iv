TestimonialsHunt Mortgage Group was a tremendous partner. They clearly demonstrated their expertise in financing multifamily properties by allowing us to factor capital improvements into the loan. The result was significantly more funds available for property improvements, with an LTV over 80%.Erik DowlingPartnerThe SilverBrick GroupTestimonialsThe dedication and expertise I found with the Hunt team has once again proven instrumental for a smooth and timely closing during our recent multifamily acquisition. In fact, we were so pleased we followed that deal with three refinancings!Gina WilliamsChief Financial OfficerSouthstar Capital Group, LLCTestimonialsWe consider Hunt Mortgage Group a strategic business partner.
