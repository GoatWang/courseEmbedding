Stanley Black & Decker Plans to Build on Iconic Craftsman Brand



by Chris Marshall • May 9, 2017 


Print



Print




 


On March 9, Stanley Black & Decker successfully completed its purchase of the Craftsman Brand from Sears Holdings Corporation for a net present value of approximately $900 million in cash. This acquisition gives Stanley Black & Decker the right to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman-branded products outside the Sears Holdings and Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores distribution channels.
“We are pleased to complete the purchase of the Craftsman Brand, a legendary American brand with tremendous consumer awareness built on a legacy of providing reliable products at a good value and standing behind them,” says James M. Loree, Stanley Black & Decker’s president and chief executive officer.

Immediately upon acquisition, Stanley Black & Decker intended to begin broadening Craftsman’s product availability to its customers but announced that the process “would take some time.” To that end, “our efforts are now focused on supply chain activities to initially support sales into non-Sears Holding channels,” Loree says. “We are developing commercial strategies for the brand and remain very excited about the potential growth opportunities. We continue to see a clear path towards annual growth of approximately $100 million a year for the next decade.”
For loyal and long-time Craftsman customers, this change of ownership surely brings questions to mind. To that end, a March 9 news release from Stanley Black & Decker has provided a number of answers that eZine readers might find helpful to know. For your convenience, we offer a sampling of them here:
Will Sears continue to sell Craftsman products, and will the Craftsman warranty remain the same?
Stanley reports that Sears will continue sourcing, marketing and selling Craftsman-branded products in their stores, independently from Stanley Black & Decker. Further, Craftsman branded products will continue to be covered under their existing warranties.
Why did Stanley Black & Decker purchase Craftsman?
 Stanley Black & Decker believes Craftsman’s rich history, high consumer awareness and loyal following adds to Stanley Black & Decker’s breadth of brands and can provide even more solutions to customers. The company also intends to “bring innovation and investment back to Craftsman, making it stronger than ever before.”

Will Craftsman’s product line remain the same?
Stanley Black & Decker reports that while it will remain focused on cost, quality and delivery of solutions to customers at the highest standards, “we are confident that there is an opportunity to build upon Craftsman’s heritage as an iconic American brand that stands for high quality, value-oriented products.”
Will Craftsman products be manufactured in the United States?
Stanley Black & Decker intends to localize as much manufacturing as possible, focusing on U.S. manufacturing with global materials, with the confidence that this will help to grow the Craftsman brand. “There’s a lot of excitement and positive energy around our stated intention of bringing manufacturing for the Craftsman Brand back to the United States,” Loree stated recently to investors. “Our plans for a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility are starting to take shape.”

Whether or not Sears continues to carry Craftsman may be a moot as so many Sears locations are closing.
Ace Hardware currently carries Craftsman as well. Didn’t see that mentioned. Will it continue?
What other retailers is Stanley/B&D considering? The Big Box stores have their own labels (like Kobalt at Lowe’s) but carry Stanley and B&D; would Craftsman be a conflict?






Paul



So good to see.  I’ve never had a problem with a Craftsman tool.  Or a Black & Decker one either.






oldcardinal



hope they will be Made in U.S.A. if not they will go the way of other pieces of junk from china






bob817



Stanley, Craftsman and Black & Decker’s  quality has undoubtedly gone down hill with new ownerships in the past, lets hope they get back to the Quality and Pride that was intended by the men that started these industries, Time will tell.






Vorant



So what are they going to do, rebrand  “harbor freight” quality tools and  sell as Craftsman? Lets face it, Stanley Black and Decker’s own quality has slipped into chinese manufactured junk.






Vorant



More U.S. manufacturing?  Don’t hold your breath….






ChrisB



I would think that if they brought the manufacturing back to the US (or wherever), that it would be pretty much automated. That would leave the jobs to be had, in support of those operations.
More important; are they going to stand behind those products like the original Craftsman brand? Even that warranty has been slipping as time goes on.
One of the things I have liked about the Craftsman tool brand is that they are accessible.
The tools aren’t the absolute best but, If you had a problem, you could go to a local Sears store and negotiate a replacement.
Hopefully, the new owners will stand up to that reputation.
Chris






DAH20



If I’m not mistaken Stanley Black and Decker also purchased Delta Tool line a few years back and that brand has almost disappeared off the market ! Hopefully they’ll do a better job with the Craftsman line ! Come to think of it I haven’t purchased a Black and Decker power tool in many many years. Do they even make power tools under that name anymore?
