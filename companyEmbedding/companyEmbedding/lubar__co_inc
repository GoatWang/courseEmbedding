For over 50 years, in collaboration with dozens of vibrant, vital businesses, Lubar & Co. has been helping companies, their communities and their legacies thrive.
                    

                        Lubar & Co. traces its history back to the early 1960s, when founder  Sheldon Lubar developed a business investment strategy he called Professional Ownership®.
                    

                        The concept was to serve as a knowledgeable, sophisticated private investor bringing together the large pools of institutional capital and the many buy-out opportunities that existed. At that time, institutional investors had neither the staff nor the
                        resources to identify acquisition candidates or to select, motivate, monitor and hold management accountable for executing the business plan, Lubar reasoned.
                    

                        Professional Ownership® was put to the test when Lubar acquired Sorgel Electric Corp. in collaboration with Massachusetts Mutual Life, State Mutual Life and First National Bank of Boston. Five years later, Sorgel had increased revenues 3 times and was
                        merged into Square D Corp. for a record return on investment.
                    

                        Over the years, Lubar & Co. has applied Professional Ownership® to many companies. Today, our investments are permanent unless compelling events arise that would cause management and ourselves to be sellers.
                    

                        Five decades and dozens of successful businesses later, with David Lubar now in charge of daily operations as president and CEO, Lubar & Co. continues to partner with management teams to pursue new
                        investment opportunities.

Resilience Capital Partners Completes Sale of ChemDesign Products to Lubar & Co.

									 from   Resilience Capital Partners 











 
















































 

 




















 


CLEVELAND, Nov. 27, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Resilience Capital Partners ("Resilience") is pleased to announce that ChemDesign Products, Inc. ("ChemDesign" or the "Company"), a portfolio company of The Resilience Fund II, L.P., has been acquired by Lubar & Co. ("Lubar"), a Milwaukee-based private investment firm.  ChemDesign is one of the leading providers of custom toll manufacturing services to the global chemical industry. The company has developed a strong reputation for partnering with its blue-chip customers, utilizing its technical personnel, flexible manufacturing facilities and process optimization capabilities to produce highly complex chemicals.
The sale of ChemDesign generated a great result for Resilience, its investors, and the management team of the Company with a 3.8x net return on invested capital and a 25.9% net internal rate of return. "Our investment in ChemDesign is a great case study in corporate renewal.  Through hard work, vision, and an operations oriented approach real value was created for the benefit of all the Company's various stakeholders," said Bassem Mansour, Co-CEO of Resilience.  Resilience acquired ChemDesign in October 2006 in a chapter 11 363 Sale. The original investment thesis was focused on the Company's unique and flexible processing capabilities selling into attractive end markets.  
"I am proud of our many accomplishments," said David Mielke, ChemDesign's CEO. "Resilience, as a partner, has been critical to our success by providing the capital structure at the onset and supporting the management team through a dynamic transition in an unpredictable economic climate.  I have found the working relationship and support between the management team and Resilience unique and refreshing. They balance high standards of performance with a true understanding of the business and its capabilities." Early on Resilience recognized that capital investment trends in the specialty chemical industry presented an opportunity for a domestic contract manufacturer that focused on flexibilty.  "While the economy certainly created some unpredicted challenges, it is a credit to the strong management team led by David that we were able to maintain focus on our investment thesis that an independently owned chemical manufacturer with investment in the right asset mix would be an attractive investment," said Ki Mixon, a Partner of Resilience.
Jones Day served as legal counsel and Dresner Partners acted as exclusive financial advisor to ChemDesign, Resilience and its affiliates.
About Resilience Capital Partners Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, Resilience Capital Partners is a leading private equity firm with a team of in-house operating experts that bring large company resources to the lower middle market. Founded in 2001 by Bassem Mansour and Steve Rosen, Resilience Capital Partners' value-oriented investment strategy focuses on acquiring companies experiencing a variety of special situations within a broad range of industries.  Since its inception, Resilience Capital Partners has invested in 27 companies under 19 platforms, together representing over $2.5 billion in revenues and over 5,000 employees. Resilience Capital Partners manages multiple private equity funds with capital under management in excess of $320 million. For more information, please visit www.resiliencecapital.com.
