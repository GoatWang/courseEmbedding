From 1 April 2009, Mithras Capital Partners LLP became the Investment Manager of 
Mithras Investment Trust plc, a private equity investment trust listed on 
the London Stock Exchange. Mithras Investment Trust plc is the majority owner of Mithras Capital Partners 
LLP and this effectively makes Mithras Investment Trust self-managed. Further information on Mithras 
Investment Trust can be found under the relevant section of the website.
