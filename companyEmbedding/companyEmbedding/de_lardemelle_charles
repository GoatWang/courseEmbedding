Title: Portfolio Manager, Founding Partner
               Company: International Value Advisers LLC
Job Details
               We manage our clients assets with a dual attempt that is unusual: in the short-term (12-18 months), our attempt is to try to preserve capital, while in the longer-term (5-10 years, i.e., over a full economic cycle), we attempt to perform better than equity indices (the MSCI All Country World Index in the case of our global strategy and the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index in the case of our international strategy). The global strategy is typically used by investors who are looking for an "all weather fund" where we are given the latitude to decide how much we should have invested in the U.S. versus outside the U.S. The international strategy is typically used by investors who practice asset allocation and want to decide for themselves how much should be allocated to a domestic manager and how much should be allocated to a pure "international" (i.e., non-U.S.) manager yet at the same time are looking for a lower risk - and lower volatility - exposure to international markets than may be obtained from a more traditional international fund. We believe our investment approach is very different from the traditional approach of most investment managers. We are trying to deliver returns that are as absolute as possible, i.e. returns that try to be as resilient as possible in down markets, while many of our competitors try to deliver good relative performance, i.e., try to beat a benchmark, and thus would be fine with being down 15% if their benchmark is down 20%. Why do we have such an unusual strategy (which, incidentally, is not easy to carry out)? Because we believe this strategy makes sense for many investors. We are fond of the quote by Mark Twain: "There are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: the first time is when he cannot afford to; the second time is when he can. We realize that many investors cannot tolerate high volatility and appreciate that "life's bills do not always come at market tops. This strategy also appeals to us at International Value Advisers since we "eat our own cooking" for a significant part of our savings (invested in IVA products) and we have an extreme aversion to losing money.

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

      8 star managers who flew the coop - Chuck de Lardemelle and Charles de Vaulx (4) - FORTUNE
    




























8 star managers who flew the coop







4 of 8






                  Chuck de Lardemelle and Charles de Vaulx
                






Previous gig: De Vaulx succeeded legendary French value investor Jean-Marie Eveillard as manager of First Eagle Global (SGENX). The fund, which invests across sectors and countries, has $20 billion in assets and is ranked in the top
                1% of its category over a 15-year period.
                
Why they split: When private equity firm TA Associates moved to take a minority stake in First Eagle, de Lardemelle and de Vaulx say they feared the company would reopen
                  their closed fund. Andy McLane, a partner at TA Associates, says the firm had no involvement in the decision, which was made by the fund's board, and that de Lardemelle and de Vaulx
                  left for other reasons.
                

Today: De Lardemelle and some of his former colleagues launched their own company, International Value Advisors, in October 2007. "I had a difficult decision to make -- stay
                  as a hired gun, or set up my own company," he says. De Vaulx joined a few months later. IVA now has $6 billion in assets. By the summer of 2009, its Worldwide (IVWAX) fund had already amassed $1.7 billion, surpassing the record for a new fund.NEXT: Don Yacktman
