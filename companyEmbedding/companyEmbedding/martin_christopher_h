About Christopher H. Martin








photographed by Robert Johnson



Bold yet meditative, dynamic and serene, the works of Christopher H. Martin harness the passions and intricate subtleties of nature.Â The success of Martinâs works is due in part to his signature practice of verre Ã©glomisÃ©. This âgilded glassâ, or reverse glass painting, is accomplished by working on the back plane of Lucite surfaces, beginning with the foreground and layering upwards of multiple compositions, one upon another, to achieve a depth and luminosity unattainable with traditional canvas.Martinâs radical reinterpretation of the art form allows for a freedom of expression reflecting contemporary dialogue. Martinâs artwork takes an interpretative view of natural patterns.Through his paintings, Christopher seeks to create an organic development of form, depth and color working together to create a unique expression.

Christopher H. Martin (born 1969) is an American artist working with paintings on acrylic and canvas mediums. A self-taught artist, he is known for his signature technique of painting in reverse, using acrylic paint on a clear sheet of acrylic.[1][2] Martin modernizes the 14th century technique of "Verre ÃglomisÃ©" to layer acrylic paint on the reverse side of his acrylic canvas in creating his original pieces. In 2006 Martin began working on his third medium, Metallic Prints. Martin has created twenty-two Metallic Print series, totaling two hundred and fifty-one photographs.
Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and raised in Orlando, Florida, Martin started his career in the financial retirement industry and quickly realized that his passion was art and creating art. Martin began painting in 1994 in Dallas, Texas where he worked and lived at his studio in Uptown. Over the years, as his career evolved, he has had five different studio/gallery locations in Dallas. Martin then partnered with another gallery owner in Los Angeles in opening The Martin Lozano Gallery and opened Christopher Martin Gallery in Aspen, Colorado in November 2010. Martin currently has his gallery in Dallas and Aspen, along with ongoing exhibitions in galleries in Houston and San Francisco.
In 2010 D Magazine considered Christopher Martin one of the 13 Most Admired Dozen People in Dallas.[3]
Christopher Martin currently resides and creates in Aspen, Colorado.

In April of 2009, Equinox of Dallas, Texas commissioned Martin to create a collection of 30 circular acrylic on acrylic pieces for their sixty-by-twenty-foot entry wall. In March of 2010 The Ritz Carlton of Dove Mountain commissioned Martin to create an array of 24 acrylic discs for their grand entry way. The discs are installed above the entrance.[7]
In October 2011, the Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas, Texas commissioned Martin to create two twelve-foot by eight-foot paintings. The pieces now hang on either side of the entrance to the Grand Ballroom on the third floor.

Projects[edit]
His ongoing twelve-year project, Kidz Creations benefits children across the Dallas area. This charity benefits children's schools and hospitals including the Texas March of Dimes, Scottish Rite Hospital, and Make a Wish. Martin has Painting Days at his studio and invites many of the children from these different charities to paint with him. After the painting is done, it is then offered at auction for their charity.[13][not in citation given]
Other charities include, Hearts for Hounds, which helps animals in need by contributing proceeds from the sale of original Heart paintings to animal shelters in Aspen, Colorado, and Dallas, Texas. Fifty per cent of proceeds benefit Friends of the Aspen Animal Shelter.[14]
Martin also created a series of paintings by adhering 9-11 newspaper headlines to canvas, then painting the U.S. flag over them. Proceeds from the sale of the series were donated to the American Red Cross. Former President George Bush Sr. was given one of Chris' 9-11 flags as the recipient of the Joseph Prize for Human Rights in 2002.[15]
Martin exhibits in eponymous galleries in Dallas, Texas and Aspen, Colorado. He is also represented in galleries across the country in Chicago, San Francisco, Sarasota, and Los Angeles.

				"I wanted to let you know the install went great. The 2 installers who came to do it were very professional and friendly. Everything was cleaned up after and not a spec of dust was anywhere to be seen, even in the driveway. I couldn't be happier with the job they did, and the room looks fantastic."
				




				"Bob and Mary, all I can say is WOW! Thank you so much for all you and the H.J. Martin and Son team did for our Parish. Even with the changes encountered in the process, you managed to get the project done on time. Everything looks great. Again, thank you for your dedication, professionalism and all the hard work put forth by your team."
				




				"My upstairs bathroom flooring was installed yesterday and once again....I love it! The installer did a great job and I am so happy with my choice. I can't wait to put up my new shower curtain and purchase new towels."
				




				"The carpet looks great!  Brian Valentine was a pleasure to work with.  His installation skills were obvious and appreciated.  He was so friendly about having to return the next day and make an adjustment to the lower step carpeting, because I had not understood how the last step should end.
Thanks for all your help!"
				




				"We are very pleased with the whole shower! The door really brings it all together, and we can just tell the level of craftsmanship is so much higher than what we previously had. Thank you again for helping us pick out the various colors and matching them together. No regrets!"
				




				"The carpet looks great!  Brian Valentine was a pleasure to work with.  His installation skills were obvious and appreciated.  He was so friendly about having to return the next day and make an adjustment to the lower step carpeting, because I had not understood how the last step should end.
Thanks for all your help!"
				




				"We want to thank Scott and Sabino for the beautiful installation they made of our tile and carpet replacements. We have been so proud to show off the new tile in the kitchen and halls. Our home looks better than it ever hasâ¦H.J. Martin and Son will be our first choice for future installations."
				




				"We are in the process of remodeling a smaller bathroom and worked with Breannaâ¦just to let you know it was a fantastic experience, very helpful, responsive and understood a vision. Work has begun and the installer is Patâ¦could not be happier, clean job site, very pleasant and also shared helpful ideas. Thought I would pass this along to you, always nice to get a positive note and feedback."
				




				"I am building a home and have been working with Amy on my flooring, backsplash, shower, etc. Amy is absolutely amazing. She is not only kind and caring, she is extremely customer focused! Her opinions are honest and she has lessened the fear of building a new home within me and my husband more than she will ever know. You have a gold mine in this employee. Amy is professional, considerate of my emotions and fears over making the right decisions. I would recommend Amy as an interior decorator to anyone who is building a new home."
				




				"Thank you Breanna, we are really excited for our project!  You deserve every kind word and it is all trueâ¦.you made or experience at HJ very positive.  You were professional, had excellent suggestions and helped us stay as close to our budget as we could.  HJ Martin is very lucky to have you on their team and we could not have been happier to work with you!"
				




				"Katie did a great job talking me into the floor and reassuring me it would look great. It sure does! The first words that come out of every visitor's mouth are "I love this floor!" Kudos to Katie!"
				




				"I like the tile and how it compliments the kitchen. Those who have seen it have said, "Wow"! Thank you for your talents and help. The two guys who installed were very good and such nice people!"
				




				"Thanks to Melissa and the installers, everything was done professionally, and timely. It's always very much appreciated when things are done the way they are promised!"
				




				"I wanted to thank you and your professionals for the great job they did at my house. Thanks to Randy, Melissa and the installers, everything was done professionally and timely.  It's always very much appreciated when things are done the way they are promised! Thank you again...great job!"
				




				"Thank you so much for being so patient, pleasant, respectful and helpful. Craig's recommendation gave us the confidence that we needed to not only choose our product but choose H.J. Martin and Son. Chris and Tomas were easy to have in our home and their work quality and work ethic was outstanding."
				




				"We did a complete renovation of our kitchen and are extremely grateful we chose to go with H.J. Martin and Son for our flooring. Andria did a super job helping us with tile selection and also just answering our questions throughout the process. The installers were great guys, very friendly and first rate craftsmen at that! Also, enough can't be said about setting a timeline and staying to schedule: H.J. Martin and Son was perfect and didn't miss a beat! Thank you H.J. Martin and Son for making our kitchen beautiful!"
				




				"The carpet installation went perfectly, and the two gentlemen that installed it couldn't have been more professional."
				




				"I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know what a wonderful employee/installer you have. Jesus installed tile in my kitchen last week. He was so impressive...he was so meticulous in his work. He wanted me to be happy with his work and I definitely was. I appreciated how he cleaned up after the job. He was so pleasant to work with and have work in my home. I will definitely go back to H.J. Martin and Son because of his quality work and the great job and follow up by Kurt."
				




				"The floor looks beautiful and your installers could not have been more professional and courteous. Thanks for helping us with this project."
				




				"Your guys did a great job! My wife is happy, and if your wife is happy, the world is happy. I appreciate the work H.J. Martin and Son did for me."
				




				"Just wanted to send a thank you for your excellent service. Companies and employees just don't take care of customers like they used to, with everyone in a hurry, but you really stood out! Whenever we need any additional flooring, I know where and who we will go to and I would recommend you to everyone!"
				




				"If I were to rate Grant (installer) on a scale from 1-10, he would be an 11.  Please pass my thanks on to him for a good job."
				




				"I wanted to thank you and your team for the quick response to the damage to our new floors. I truly appreciate how personable all of your team has been and the repair is outstanding. It looks absolutely perfect. Brian was outstanding! So nice, professional and precise. My compliments to him on his customer service skills and his attention to detail! We couldn't be happier!"
				




				"I need to say thank you for the talent/skill of Ben, your tile installer's talent that has worked at our home this week. He has done an awesome job. My wife is ecstatic!"
				




				"Stacy and I thank you for your great work at our house this summer. We love the steam shower, back hall tile and the heated floor is working great! We know you worked extra for us!"
				




				"I appreciate the outstanding customer service that you and HJ Martin have provided over the past many months. The employees we interacted with were very knowledgeable about your store's various product lines and seemed genuinely interested in helping us to find flooring that met our needs."
				




				"We stopped in your showroom, I would assume, on your busiest day of the year, the warehouse sale, and Amy took excellent care of us and followed through on every detail despite being overwhelmed with customers. We will definitely revisit HJ Martin for future purchases and recommend your company to our co-workers, relatives and friends."
				




				"They were neat, considerate, helpful and a pleasure to have in my home - I'm very pleased with the floors."
				




				"My tile installation looks wonderful and appears to be top quality. Then, this morning I had the cleaning division come out and had my carpets cleaned. Again, a very well done job."
				




				"The installer, Greg, was very courteous and professional. He answered all my questions and he did a superb job on the installation. I couldn't be happier."
				




				"This job was done with FIRST CLASS SERVICE. Chris took the time to explain the job, and how the job would be done; also helped moving my appliances."
				




				"To be honest, I never would have come there in the first place if not for my gift certificate. I guess I thought the place was too big, too expensive, and too commercial. But the whole experience turned out well. I was very pleased working with you, and your recommendations were right on."
				




				"We wanted to let you know our experience was nothing but positive. The staff in the showroom was easily accessible, we had someone come to our home to take measurements for the order and the installation team was great as well."
				




				"We choose HJ Martin because of your reputation and our relationship and we were not disappointed."
				




				"I thought it was time to let you know again that we appreciate the superb products and installation at our home.  We have had many friends and acquaintances comment on the beauty and craftsmanship of the all the flooring and tile your crews installed."
				




				"I can't tell you what it meant to me to have someone as helpful as Cindy working with me. I am very grateful."
				




				"They were very good at their jobs, polite and friendly."
				




				"Chris came to see the job that had been done. He was courteous and answered my questions with honesty. Each day I live with gratitude for your assistance and for his work ethic."
				




				"HJ Martin very pleasantly, willingly and professionally showed me options and we discussed what type of "green" products would have minimal off gases and toxicity for me, including supporting our research for purchase of Teregren bamboo flooring."
				




				"Thank you for your service, it made our purchase an easy one."
				




				"They were very careful and detailed in the installation of our hardwood and tile flooring. They are truly professionals in their trade."
				




				"The two gentlemen who cleaned our carpets were employees you should be very proud and grateful to employ."
				




				"Compliment on the quality of your carpet cleaning - your people did a superb job on carpets and furniture that gave the appearance of new material."
				




				"Compliments to your company on the professionalism that I've been experiencing. You guys have a great team and I'm looking forward to the install. Good job!"
				




				"Workmanship and care for our house is very impressive. Remodels are tough on homeowners but H.J. Martin is doing everything to keep clean up minimal and respect that we are living here."
				




				"All I can say is that you have some very special people working for your company and as a customer, this kind of service is rare and very much appreciated!"
				




				"Your unwavering commitment to satisfy customers was evident in your company's handling of the defective hardwood flooring in our home."
				




				"I was very impressed with how professional and courteous HJ Martin was and I compliment you on your attention to detail - fantastic job!"
				




				"Designer did a great job with ideas and samples. Installers were friendly and took pride in their work. We will tell others about your excellent service."

OUR FAVORITE VINTAGE PAINTINGS & THE BEST WAYS TO USE THEM
When it comes to vintage paintings, some rely on a soulmate factorâyou know, that gut feeling that a vintage painting was just made for you. But if youâre looking to fill an entire home with vintage paintings, you might need a game plan thatâs a little more, well, decisive. To help, weâre sharing a handful of our favorite vintage and used paintings along with tips on how to maximize them in your home. 
NAUTICAL LANDSCAPES
Question: who wouldnât love an ocean view? Thankfully, a nautical landscape makes one easier than ever to obtain. A category thatâs collectively composed of vintage paintings like seascapes and sailboat scenes, nautical paintings read like portals (portholes?) into the maritime world. 
Thanks to their blue-heavy palettes, these vintage paintings are easy to factor into virtually any space, but we personally love the tranquility they lend to a bedroom. While deciding on art for over the bed can be tricky, nautical paintings are practically fail-proof. Theyâre both serene and dramatic, perfect for anchoring a large piece of furniture like a bed. But the best part about nautical landscapes? Thereâs no need to stop at just one! Among the most successful (not to mention simplest) ways to create a gallery wall is by collecting several seascapes and arranging them over a credenza or fireplace mantle. While used paintings with no common theme would look messy, a collection of vintage seascapes speak the same language, making them a perfect match. 
ABSTRACTS
If youâre looking for a vintage or used painting that will make your room sing, try a vintage abstract painting. Although splashy and stylistically daring, an abstract isnât the kind of vintage panting that will box you into a single âlook.â In fact, these used paintings pair just as beautifully with traditional dÃ©cor as they do with modern. The trick to carrying off an abstract in a traditional space? Contrasting your colorful abstract with a neutral room, or vice versa. We also recommend swearing off abstracts with colors that detour too far from the primaries to maintain a feeling of refinement. 
While we love using vintage abstracts in main living spaces, thereâs really nothing like one in an office or study. Because abstracts tend to be simpler than landscapes and portraits, these used paintings will lend an office a major note of Namaste. Place one at eye level across from or next to your desk and not only will it look great, but it will also offer up a hypnotic resting spot for tired eyes. 
PORTRAITS

From proper nobles to playful Mid-Century housewives, vintage portraits possess room-making charisma. Although their intent is often serious, vintage portraits speak to our unabashed love of quirk. Happen upon a vintage portrait in a kitchen and itâs likely to draw out a smile, while bumping into one at the end of a hallway will no doubt inspire intrigue. 
But perhaps our favorite thing about vintage paintings is that theyâre pros at breaking the rules of art hanging. Think art must hang on either side of a window? Not so. Because a vintage portrait doesnât take itself too seriously, theyâre apt for hanging in unconventional spots like under a window or above a doorframe. We also love one used in a kitchen, adorning open shelving, or propped directly on a countertop. Conventional? Absolutely not. But thatâs why we love it! 
FRUIT STILL LIFE
You know how a kitchen just looks better with fresh fruit on the counter? If thatâs any indication to the power of produce, think about selecting a fruit sill life for your kitchen. Because of their well-edited subject matter, these used paintings are usually small in scale, typically only measuring a few inches in each direction. The miniature size; however, makes them perfect for kitchens, where nooks and crannies abound. 
Not sure you have nooks? Think again. What about those narrow spaces above your cabinets or behind the sink? Most likely, youâve ignored these spaces up until now, as nothingâs ever seemed quite suitable enough to fill them. But what about a fruit still life? To further embellish the look, try dressing the space with an unexpected detail like a brass rod. The brass rod can be affixed to your wall with brackets and simple s-hooks can then be used to attach your mini used painting to the rod. 
PAINT-BY-NUMBER
If the mere mention of paint-by-numbers already has you cringing, let us assure you that these vintage paintings can look remarkably chic! A popular hobby that emerged in the 1950s, paint-by-numbers encouraged those who were not-so artfully inclined to try their hand at the brush. Although it seems hard to believe now, paint-by-numbers paintings were considered relatively serious dÃ©cor at the time, and in 1952 one even won third place in a prestigious San Francisco art contest! Unfortunately, since then, these used paintings have fallen into a less-than-serious genre.
So how does one elevate them back to their former glory? Well, for one, keep framing to a minimum. A plain gold frame can do wonders for a vintage paint-by-numbers, as can something as simple as a metal wall clip (in these cases, donât even bother framing). Next, when it comes to placing these used paintings, choose a casual room like a nursery, playroom, or a laundry room. These rooms typically have happy, playful vibes, which will lend your used paintings a cheeky, all in good fun feel.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctorâs malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0 SanctionsWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?No sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctorâs finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctorâs sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0 Board ActionsWhat are board actions?No board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.EducationGeorge Washington University School Of Medicine and Health Sciences Washington DcMedical School | Graduated 1992Emory University School Of Medicine Atlanta GaInternship Hospital | Completed Emory University School Of Medicine Atlanta GaResidency Hospital | Completed Columbia Presbyterian Medical CenterFellowship Hospital | Completed Niigata University-HiroshimaFellowship Hospital | Completed Roosevelt HospitalFellowship Hospital | Completed Awards & RecognitionWhat is a recognized doctor?Awards & HonorsHealthgrades Honor RollMedia & PublicationsDr. Martin has no media or publications listed.Awards & RecognitionWhat is a recognized doctor?Healthgrades Recognized Doctor designation identifies leading doctors who:Are board certified.Have not had their license surrendered or revoked since Healthgrades started collecting data in 2000.Have no malpractice judgments, adverse arbitration awards, or monetary settlements for the last five years in the states in which Healthgrades can collect malpractice data.Are free of state or federal disciplinary actions (sanctions) for the last five years.Healthgrades updates the Recognized Doctor list quarterly based on board certification data.

He cares about you as a person and reason for being there. His assistants Lycia and Kim along with others in the office have always been very good and helpful in person or by phone. 
55-Jodi Petersen in West Jordan, Utah | Apr 04, 2017Dr Martin is nice, friendly and took the time to explain the procedure and recovery to me. He allowed me to ask questions and took the time to answer all of them.  Great bedside manner! I would definitely recommend Dr Martin to my family and friends! 55-Julie in Salt Lake City, UT | Apr 02, 2017I would highly recommend Dr. Martin. I found him to be personable and  knowledgeable.
Most of all, I felt he was very competent and experienced with my symptoms and subsequent surgery for De Quervain's Syndrome.
From start to finish, this was a very positive and professional experience.55Salt Lake City, Utah | Mar 18, 2017My recent experience with Dr. Martin was outstanding and I would strongly recommend him to anyone seeking an orthopedic surgeon. He was immediately responsive to my search for a surgeon to evaluate a broken wrist and scheduled surgery the next day.  Dr. Martin was completely open to questions and concerns.
Follow up appointments were efficient, referral to an excellent physical therapist was immediate and highly beneficial.  The surgical team at St Marks is excellent, friendly and professional. 15-Ken Preece  in North Salt Lake | Apr 10, 2016Inept, apathetic, complacent, and arrogant accurately describe Dr. Martin. He gives little if any weight to patient input. He amputated far too much of my finger. He said he could deepen my web space  by 1/2. He deepend it by 1/16th. The M.A. who attempted to remove my sutures used no gloves, had long nails and a ring. She left three sutures in my hand explaining that she could not tell what was connected to what and to remove them myself. I've tried. I still have sutures and a hole in my hand45-jm richmond in Salt Lake City, UT | Feb 06, 2016Have already recommended him.  He is a talented surgeon with a professional attitude.More CommentsHave you seen Dr. Christopher Martin, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Martin?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.
