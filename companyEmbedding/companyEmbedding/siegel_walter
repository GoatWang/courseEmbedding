Charley Varrick is a small-time crook who outfoxes the Mob in this fast-paced offbeat thriller directed by Don Siegel. Academy Award winner Walter Matthau stars in a rare dramatic role, along with the powerful Joe Don Baker, as a tough Mafia hitman.   Charley robs small banks with small payrolls. That keeps him out of trouble until he stumbles onto the Mob's secret stash. The chase is on as the Big Boys go after the "Last of the Independents." It's a heart-pounding ride that builds to a fiery airborne climax as Charley makes his last desperate run for the Mexican border and safety.

In this film, robbers discover after cleaning out a small town bank's vault that the amount of money they've stolen is way above the expected take and must have mob ties. Andy Robinson (the psycho in Dirty Harry) plays Varrick's naive partner; Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) is the hit man the mob recruits to get back the money. In smaller roles, John Vernon is a nervous mobster responsible for having picked that particular bank as a mob drop, Felicia Farr and Sheree North (both looking good, both smooth and smart), veteran character actor Tom Tully and Jacqueline Scott (sister of TV's Fugitive) are all superb. Director Don Siegel keeps the story nicely paced and Matthau's dry, thoughtful gum-chewing Varrick trying to stay alive and a step ahead of the mob is really tops. Also pay attention to his small talk...it matters as the story develops.Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsThis is one of my favorite heist moviesByMisterMedusaon March 20, 2015Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThis is one of my favorite heist movies, with a deliberate, measured performance (almost deadpan at times) by the great Walter Matthau, who shows very little emotion as the character of Varrick, even when his getaway driver/ wife dies from injuries sustained in the bank robbery. This works very well for his character though. Cool and impassionate on the outside. Clever and calculating on the inside. After robbing a small rural bank, Varrick realizes they've nabbed about three-quarters of a million dollars. Way too much for a bank that size.  He realizes it must be a 'drop'. Money left there by the mafia for a later pick-up. Varrick knows that giving it back isn't an option. "Nobody takes the mob for that kind of money and lives to tell about it", to paraphrase his words. The only partner of his to survive the caper (Andy Robinson, who played the psychopathic sniper in 'Dirty Harry') is a tightly wound, volatile mess of a man intent on spending his share of the loot right away, instead of sitting on it for the four or five years that Varrick recommends. Charley pretends to acquiesce, but secretly makes plans to make sure his hard-drinking partner never spends a dime of the money.  All this, and Joe Don Baker as a sociopathic sledge-hammer of a man contracted by the mob to get back their money. Charley Varrick has to use every bit of his cunning to stay one step ahead of a grim fate.  I happened across this movie one night on a cable channel, and was so glad I did. Knew I had to have it on DVD someday. No classic Walter Matthau humor in this one. Well, except maybe for the scene with Sheree north who plays a woman forging very expensive illegal passports for Varrick and his partner, and then tries to charge him another five hundred dollars for a sucker on his way out!  Great movie, with a very satisfying ending. They don't make 'em like this anymore.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsBare bones version of a very good movie..ByM. Kennyon December 29, 2015Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThe Picture quality is good and the sound is as well.  This DVD is really just a bare bones, no SDH or subtitles of any kind, no chapters, no extras, nothing but a FULL SCREEN (1:1.33) picture.  A shame as it is a Don Siegel film and very well done and deserves better, at least what they did for Madigan (another Siegel picture).  I have seen that the original was cropped for wide screen showing and that looks to be the case as this is not your normal pan and scan full screen version, the picture does not wonder back and forth and every scene looks properly framed.There is a BD disc available on Amazon in wide screen but only for region B so a multi-region Blu-Ray player is needed.  I may get it just to see the difference in the framing.Good story and very good cast with a non-Siegel type ending that I really enjoyed.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsCLEVER EARLY 70S CRIME FAREByAmazon Customeron July 1, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseYES.  EARLY 70S CRIME PULP, but it's good crime pulp.  It was fun to watch Walter Matthau play against type as desperate, experienced criminal saddled with a desperate, dumb, and dangerous partner.  Semi-professional bank robbers accidently stumble into professional crime and make ruthless enemies.  This is good 70s drive-in crime and worth a watch.  I believe Tarantino "borrowed" a line from this film in PULP FICTION.  This is the story of a man of values and patience who must survive in a world with neither.  I've seen it 3 times in my life before this evening and I feel this film was worth the time and money it cost me for rent.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsOffbeat Gem Hard to FindByAMAZON PURCHASERon June 20, 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThe early seventies produced some wonderful "sleeper" films like "Friends of Eddie Coyle," "Emperor of the North" and this gem directed by Don Siegel.  The plot has more twists than a pretzel factory and a fist-rate cast who do the story justice.  This disc is a hard-to-find item, and mysteriously there is no Blu-Ray version out yet.Read more11 comment|
