For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Item�2.
Legal Proceedings.  Disclosure from Citibank, N.A., as Certificate Administrator:

Citibank, N.A. (�Citibank�) is acting as the Certificate Administrator of this commercial mortgage-backed securities (�CMBS�) transaction.
In the ordinary course of business, Citibank is involved in a number of legal proceedings, including in connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securities (�RMBS�) transactions.�Certain of these
Citibank as trustee-related matters are disclosed herein.  On June�18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the �Trust Indenture
Act�), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank�s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November�24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this
action.�On the same day, a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court. In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs� original state court action. Citibank�s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was
fully briefed as of May�13, 2015. On September�8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. Subsequently, plaintiffs voluntarily
dismissed all claims with respect to two of the three trusts. On April�7, 2017, Citibank filed a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs have indicated that they will file a motion for partial summary judgment, which, along with their
opposition to Citibank�s motion for summary judgment, will be due on May�22, 2017.  On November�24, 2015, the same investors that brought
the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee. This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in
the federal action, and one additional trust. The investors assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York�s Streit Act (the �Streit Act�).
Citibank�s motion to dismiss was fully briefed as of April�15, 2016. Following oral argument on Citibank�s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August�5, 2016. Citibank�s motion to dismiss the amended
complaint was fully briefed as of October�21, 2016. Citibank awaits a decision.  On August�19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(�FDIC�) as receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York. This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee. FDIC asserts
claims for breach of contract, violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank jointly briefed a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their
capacity as trustee, and whose cases are also in front of Judge Carter. Defendants� joint motion to dismiss was fully briefed as of March�22, 2016. On September�30, 2016, the court granted Citibank�s motion to dismiss the
complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On October�14, 2016, FDIC filed a motion for reargument or relief from judgment from the court�s dismissal order. On October�25, 2016, the court granted leave for
defendants to file an opposition brief. Defendants filed their opposition on November�15, 2016 and plaintiff filed its reply brief on November�22, 2016. Citibank awaits a decision from the court on plaintiff�s motion. 
There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Citibank denies
liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibank�s ability to perform its
duties as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this CMBS transaction.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has paid down by 2.9% to $842 million from $867 million at issuance. Fitch has designated one loan (0.5%) as a Fitch Loan of Concern. Minor interest shortfalls are currently affecting the non-rated class G.Stable Performance: The transaction's overall performance remains stable with property level performance generally in-line with issuance expectations. As of October 2016, all loans remain current and no loans have transferred to special servicing since issuance. As of year-end (YE) 2015, aggregate pool-level net operating income (NOI) improved 4.4% from 2014 and was 3.3% lower than NOI at issuance.Pool Concentration: Retail properties represent the largest concentration at 49.1% of the pool, including six of the top 10 loans. Additionally, upcoming loan maturities consist of 23.2% of the pool in 2018, with the remaining 76.8% in 2023.Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 12.4% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. Nine loans (15.5% of the pool) are interest-only for the full term. Additionally, 10.3% of the current pool consists of loans that still have a partial interest-only component during their remaining loan term, compared to 39.9% of the original pool at issuance.Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A' or 'A-' to four of the 10 largest loans in the pool, which represent 27.4% of the current pool balance. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better were assigned to 56.1% of the pool based on the original balance at issuance.Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: One of the top 15 loans in the pool, 22 East 60th (1.9% of the pool), was assigned an investment-grade credit opinion at issuance.RATING SENSITIVITIESRating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable due to increasing credit enhancement and continued stable performance of the pool. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. Future upgrades are possible if 2018 maturing loans (23.8%) pay off without issue, as credit enhancement would improve. Downgrades may be possible should overall performance decline significantly.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--$21.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$193 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$120 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$192.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$55.5 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$69.4 million class A-S* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$54.2 million class B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$33.6 million class C* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$157.2 million class PEZ* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$42.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$17.3 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$8.7 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;--$661 million class X-A** at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$54.2 million class X-B** at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$17.3 million class X-C** at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.*The class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for the class A-S, B and C certificates.**Notional amount and interest-only.Fitch does not rate the class G and X-D certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)Read Morehttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchCitigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-GC17 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/727717Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013806Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013806Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2013-GC17 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2013-GC17
    





October 26, 2016 05:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-GC17 
      (CGCMT 2013-GC17). A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end 
      of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has paid down by 2.9% to $842 million from 
      $867 million at issuance. Fitch has designated one loan (0.5%) as a 
      Fitch Loan of Concern. Minor interest shortfalls are currently affecting 
      the non-rated class G.
    

      Stable Performance: The transaction's overall performance remains stable 
      with property level performance generally in-line with issuance 
      expectations. As of October 2016, all loans remain current and no loans 
      have transferred to special servicing since issuance. As of year-end 
      (YE) 2015, aggregate pool-level net operating income (NOI) improved 4.4% 
      from 2014 and was 3.3% lower than NOI at issuance.
    

      Pool Concentration: Retail properties represent the largest 
      concentration at 49.1% of the pool, including six of the top 10 loans. 
      Additionally, upcoming loan maturities consist of 23.2% of the pool in 
      2018, with the remaining 76.8% in 2023.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 12.4% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. Nine loans (15.5% of the pool) 
      are interest-only for the full term. Additionally, 10.3% of the current 
      pool consists of loans that still have a partial interest-only component 
      during their remaining loan term, compared to 39.9% of the original pool 
      at issuance.
    

      Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A' or 'A-' 
      to four of the 10 largest loans in the pool, which represent 27.4% of 
      the current pool balance. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' 
      or better were assigned to 56.1% of the pool based on the original 
      balance at issuance.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: One of the top 15 loans in the 
      pool, 22 East 60th (1.9% of the pool), was assigned an investment-grade 
      credit opinion at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable due to increasing credit 
      enhancement and continued stable performance of the pool. Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Future upgrades are possible if 2018 maturing loans (23.8%) pay off 
      without issue, as credit enhancement would improve. Downgrades may be 
      possible should overall performance decline significantly.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$21.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$193 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$120 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$192.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55.5 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69.4 million class A-S* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54.2 million class B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$42.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17.3 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8.7 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$661 million class X-A** at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54.2 million class X-B** at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17.3 million class X-C** at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *The class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for the class 
      A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      **Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G and X-D certificates.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2013-GC17 P-T Ctfs
    





December 09, 2013 01:47 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Outlooks to Citigroup 
      Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-GC17 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates:
    

      --$46,093,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$192,952,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$192,342,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,534,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$17,341,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,670,000b class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      a Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      b Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      c Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for up to the 
      full certificate principal amount of the class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $34,681,987 class G or the $43,351,987 
      interest-only class X-D.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 65 loans secured by 70 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $867 million as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp., Starwood Mortgage Funding I LLC, Goldman 
      Sachs Mortgage Company, Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., and 
      The Bancorp Bank.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.2% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis and asset summary reviews on 87.2% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.16x and 101.8%, 
      respectively, are slightly worse than the first half 2013 and 2012 
      averages of 1.36x and 99.8% and 1.24x and 97.2%, respectively.
    

      Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A' or 'A-' 
      to four of the 10 largest loans in the pool, which represent 26.9% of 
      the pool balance. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better 
      were assigned to 56.1% of the pool.
    

      Retail Concentration: Retail properties represent the largest 
      concentration at 49.1% of the pool, including six of the top 10 loans. 
      This is higher than the first half 2013 average retail concentration of 
      31.6%. The next largest property type concentrations are office (19.9%), 
      and hotel (11.3%). The hotel concentration is in line with the 2012 
      average pool concentration.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 12.4% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. The pool's concentration of 
      partial-interest loans (39.9%), which includes five of the 10 largest 
      loans, is higher than the first-half 2013 average (30.7%). However, the 
      pool's concentration of full-term interest-only loans (15%) is slightly 
      lower than the first-half 2013 average (19%).
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.7% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which most 
      recent NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted loans 
      and potentially in rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2013-GC17 certificates 
      and found that the transaction displays slightly above-average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result.
    

      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities in the Rating Sensitivity and Rating Stresses 
      sections of the presale.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., rated 'CMS1-' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by 
      Fitch.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
