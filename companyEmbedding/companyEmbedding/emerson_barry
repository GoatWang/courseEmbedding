Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksTop10 Accounting ServicesAccounting Services on Sale Now.Low Prices on Accounting Services.MerchantHunter.com/AccountingAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Barry Epstein CPA1 E Wacker DrChicago, IL 60601(312) 346-4242Accountants-Certified PublicBookkeepingAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Clairmont Barry J CPA625 N Michigan AveChicago, IL 60611(413) 499-3733Accounting ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Steiner, Barry R, CPA1211 W Farwell AveChicago, IL 60626(773) 274-1053Accountants-Certified PublicWebsiteMake an AppointmentAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Barry L Jutovsky CPA and Associates550 W Frontage RdNorthfield, IL 60093(847) 386-6801Accountants-Certified PublicAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Barry A Laub CPA18118 Martin AveHomewood, IL 60430(708) 957-9600Accountants-Certified PublicBookkeepingMake an AppointmentAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Zachary C Barry111 W Washington StChicago, IL 60602(312) 782-5500Tax Return PreparationMake an AppointmentAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Law Office of Barry R.

 Vibration MonitoringPrevents $250,000 Incidentat Braskem »Even the best-maintained equipment can surprise plant operators with an unexpected breakdown, but as engineers at Braskem’s PP4 polypropylene unit in São Paulo, Brazil recently confirmed, if an incipient fault is detected early enough and monitored carefully, a potential catastrophic failure can be turned into a scheduled, routine repair.
​










 Changing of the Guard inNuclear PressureTransmitting »After 14 years of development and testing, Emerson is seamlessly transitioning its legendary, 40-year-old Rosemount 1150 Series of nuclear-qualified pressure transmitters to its new 3150 Series.
​










Refinery Improves Compliance & Reduces Costs with Wireless »Measurement Solutions Cut Green House Gas Compliance Costs by Half »Control-Disk™ Butterfly Valves Enable Throttling Control in Rolled-Steel Cooling System »













 Ergon’s Mobile WorkersEmbrace Wireless Freedom »Wouldn’t it be nice to get off the walkie-talkies and bring your control-room interfaces right out to where your process applications are running? You could get off the radios, stop playing telephone tag with coworkers, punch changes into the system directly and see orders carried out seamlessly. It’d be even better for configuration and turnaround work, and you’d probably save a bunch of time and money, too.










 Role of Fired HeaterSafety Systems »A fully automated burner management system operating as an SIS for burner control can meet minimum safety targets, improve system availability and lower costs.

 Ergon’s Mobile WorkersEmbrace Wireless Freedom »Wouldn’t it be nice to get off the walkie-talkies and bring your control-room interfaces right out to where your process applications are running? You could get off the radios, stop playing telephone tag with coworkers, punch changes into the system directly and see orders carried out seamlessly. It’d be even better for configuration and turnaround work, and you’d probably save a bunch of time and money, too.

It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Barry’s Full ProfileSummaryTREASURY & OPERATIONS EXECUTIVEAs Global Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Operations at Emerson Radio Corporation, I have been implementing a number of changes within the organization that have made daily operations more efficient and cost effective. My finance team has been responsible for driving improvements that significantly reduce operations and treasury costs. My leadership has helped the company to invest in growth and benefit shareholders. As a result of working with banks in the US and abroad, credit facilities have expanded, favorable terms have been negotiated and funding has been generated for new product lines, new streams of revenue, increased sales, and profitability. My team and I have achieved financial results aligned with corporate goals for growth and expansion.Throughout the years, I have been fortunate to develop deep and rich knowledge across multiple disciplines, including corporate finance transactions, global banking relationships, process reengineering, performance turnaround, team leadership, and management supervision. Known as the “go-to guy” for information and problem solving, I bring fresh ideas and new ways of doing things that can offer new perspectives on the same issue. Early experience working at the FDIC as well as the corporate experience that followed has given me a unique understanding of banking relationships and banking matters. This has proven to be an asset in complex business reorganizations stemming from Chapter 11 protection and bankruptcy, as well as audits and compliance.

There are generally two ways to get a mortgage in Canada: From a bank or from a licensed mortgage professional.
While a bank only offers the products from their particular institution, licensed mortgage professionals send millions of dollars in mortgage business each year to Canada's largest banks, credit unions, trust companies, and financial institutions; offering their clients more choice, and access to hundreds of mortgage products! As a result, clients benefit from the trust, confidence, and security of knowing they are getting the best mortgage for their needs.
Whether you're purchasing a home for the first time, taking out equity from your home for investment or pleasure, or your current mortgage is simply up for renewal, it's important that you are making an educated buying decision with professional unbiased advice.
