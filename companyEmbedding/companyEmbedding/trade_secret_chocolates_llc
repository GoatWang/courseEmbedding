The First Bean to Bag company



























 
Chocolate on Tap
Our mission is to change the conversation when it comes to enjoying great chocolate. A great chocolate tasting experience is as much about the 'how' as it is about the 'what'. Different from both drinking chocolates or chocolate bars, our liquid chocolate on tap provides a new way to experience this amazing substance. In its liquid form, the taste profile of chocolate is magnified. Your taste buds don't have to do the work of melting the chocolate to body temperature, leaving the taste buds' efforts available for their main purpose. Tasting. The rich subtleties and complex flavors that come from differences in the beans and roasting profiles are more pronounced, instantaneous, and long-lasting, creating a completely unique tasting experience. In our experience as chocolate makers, we know the pure joy of tasting a spoonful of just-finished chocolate. Now you can, too.Whether you are a chocolate connoisseur or just enjoy a good treat, try it today and experience the difference.
 



OUR 3 CORE PRINCIPLES​
1. We work for the beans











 
Our artisan chocolate focuses on unlocking the unique and complex flavors found within each batch of premium beans. Similar to fine wines, great coffees, and premium olive oils, high quality cacao beans all carry a signature flavor. We use our special small batch process - which is a trade secret :) - to capture each batch's unique flavor profiles and deliver a great, one-of-a-kind product to our customers. Differences in varietals, region of origin, harvesting method, and weather all serve to make each batch a unique tasting experience.​
 




2. We use only 3 simple ingredients











 
At Trade Secret Chocolates we only use three simple ingredients to make our amazing chocolate - Roasted Cacao Nibs, Organic Cane Sugar, and Organic Cacao Butter. Driven by his wife’s allergies to ingredients in mass produced chocolates, our founder, entrepreneur and chemist Matt Rubin set out to create a better product and a happier spouse. His journey led him to develop rich, dark chocolate concoctions that focus on using only these three simple ingredients. We remain true to this pure recipe to this day.
 




3. We make people happy











 
Whether it's our retailers, consumers, or our company employees, our focus is on making the Trade Secret Chocolates experience great for everyone. Chocolate is a source of joy and happiness, and we believe the company that produces it should be, too. We've built a team of passionate people who strive to create happy customers and consumers. We often sit down with our customers to help develop new recipes or suggest new pairings to ensure an amazing consumer experience.

Amazing Chocolate Experienced in a Whole New Way
We use only premium ingredients from all over the world - including Peru, Nicaragua, Madagascar, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela - to make each batch unique.​Using our special small batch process, which is a trade secret :),  we focus on capturing each batch's unique flavor profiles to deliver a one of a kind product to customers and consumers. Differences in varietals, region of origin, harvesting method, and weather all serve to make each batch a different tasting experience.Playing off the company’s name 'Trade Secret', TSC's packaging takes on the look of an actual legal, patent document. In fact, each bag has a label embossed with a red foil seal along with custom production details such as cacao nib origin, batch number, and date produced.To help our customers fully capture that unique experience we try to bring out with each roast, we also include 'Tasting Notes' on every package based on the specifics of the batch. Try a few different types to see the differences, or if you find a batch you like,  get a few to use and enjoy.

Our chocolate is loved by our customers as a standalone dessert. However, that is just the beginning. After enjoying our chocolate by itself, it usually gets our customer's creative juices flowing and they begin coming up with many new uses and recipes to use our product in ways we couldn't have imagined. As a platform ingredient, we are continually impressed with what our customer's are able to devise. Below is a small sample of what our customers have created.

We are staying quiet (for the moment)
Don't worry, we are still here. Its been a lot of long hours, late nights, and engineering hurdles to tackle to make liquid chocolate on tap a reality. Needless to say, we've been staying pretty busy perfecting our craft and preparing to launch ourselves as the first Bean to Bag company. Check back soon to see what we've been doing.

About | Little Secrets

















































































Our Mission
We don’t pretend to be good at everything … or even most things. But where we lack in geography bowl trophies we make up for by being really, really good at making candy-coated chocolate.
We’re all about sourcing the best ingredients and creating premium blends without any artificial ingredients, flavors or colors because the words “delicious” and “natural” can and should absolutely go together.
Pretty regular at everything else, but our candy game’s tight. And like any good little secret, sharing is optional.
 

 


All of our candy is made with Fair Trade chocolate.



No Yellow No. 5 here. We use fruit + vegetable extracts to color our candies. (Don’t worry, they don’t taste like a salad bar.)



Non-GMO certification in process — stay tuned!





We leave the corn on the cob. (No corn syrup in any of our products!)



All of our flavors are made with 55% cocoa dark chocolate.



Got a burning question?
Make your way to our FAQ!



Our Story
Decades ago inside a corner store, a nine year old Chris Mears on roller blades stealthily slipped a piece of candy into the pocket of his jeans and rolled his way to the door. He was stopped, did his time, and reformed his ways, but his sincere love of chocolate still remains. Now a certified grown-up with a penchant for unwrapping candy bars mid-afternoon, Chris wanted to find a way to make his guilty pleasures less incriminating. And yea, verily, so became Little Secrets, an incredible candy brand that sources the best ingredients, says nahhh to any artificial anythings, and understands hiding a bag of our candy-coated chocolates in your top desk drawer.
