Robert L. Richards was a film screenwriter.
Richards worked on a number of notable films of the 1940s and 1950s including Winchester '73, Johnny Stool Pigeon, and Act of Violence. His radio work included writing for the Suspense series which aired on the CBS network from 1942 until 1962. Among Richards' numerous Suspense offerings was his critically acclaimed neogothic horror thriller entitled The House in Cypress Canyon broadcast on December 5, 1946. Considered one of the tautest, most chilling dramas in the Suspense canon, the now classic show featured Robert Taylor, Cathy Lewis, Hans Conried, and Howard Duff in starring roles.
Richards was blacklisted in Hollywood because of his left wing views. He wrote under various pseudonyms to get work, until he finally gave up and became a carpenter. He retired to Pátzcuaro, Mexico, where he died, still bitter about the career he had lost.
