About Oviatt





Why Oviatt:
Oviatt, formerly Feldman and Oviatt Audiology Services have been the leader in Upstate New York for diagnostic hearing testing, vestibular evaluation, and hearing aids for over 25 years.
Oviatt has professionally licensed audiologists specializing in evaluating and treating people with hearing loss. The staff at Oviatt work closely with physicians, conducting tests on patients to determine not only the amount of hearing loss, but possible causes.
Oviatt is excited about a new development in hearing aids that uses state-of-the-art technology to automatically detect speech. When none is detected, the voice-activated digital system automatically turns volume down to a more comfortable listening mode.

Testimonials


"I would like to thank you for your assistance in improving my hearing abilities. I've gone my entire life without completely hearing which has affected my ability to communicate in a professional manner. Now I don't miss information or misunderstand information. Thank you."
— Jacqueline O'Dell


"Just a note to thank you for your professional and courteous assistance that your staff provided me during my visits to your office, which made all the difference to me. Words cannot sufficiently express my gratitude. Thank you."
— Julia Petrus


"Since obtaining this programmable hearing aid, I have come to enjoy more fully a new world of sounds like birds singing and other sounds of nature. It’s a wonderful device that provides me with the flexibility to meet my needs.  I am very pleased with its performance."
— Ann Alexander


"I purchased my first hearing aid in 2000 when I moved to this area. I went to University HealthCare to Oviatt Hearing and Balance. I have been pleased with the improvement and this year, after my hearing test, I realized my right ear was in need of help. Dr. Oviatt has been most helpful in adjusting both. I know if any problem arises, Dr. Oviatt will be, and has been, most happy to correct it, always to my satisfaction. I am always happy to recommend their service to anyone who needs it. I always feel sure they will be taken care of."
— M. Rita Finn


"It's hard to express how you've changed the quality of my life. I want to thank you for your patience and kindness to me and for your clear explanations. The hearing aids do their job well. I'm so grateful to my friend for bringing me to Oviatt. I had not realized I'd let it get so bad. I would certainly recommend you to anyone who is having trouble hearing."
— Patricia L. Milliman
