Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank.

Our Morning Meetings
Proprietary Valuation Model: GRAD Point Methodology






 



Philosophy & Strategies
Mastrapasqua Asset  Management advises an array of clients having investment objectives  ranging from a growth objective, employing an all equity strategy, to an income  objective, which may invest largely in fixed income.

            The majority of our clients require a balanced  allocation, using both equity and fixed  income, as well as cash equivalents. In addition to  producing income, a fixed income allocation can reduce  volatility of balanced portfolios. Prior to investing, we work to fully  understand each client’s unique investment parameters before developing an  initial asset allocation.
Equity
Building the wealth of our clients through  disciplined portfolio management is our primary goal. When it comes to our  equity portfolios, our investment style is defined as a sector-focused. We  analyze investments using our proprietary screens, in-house research, and  direct contact with companies. We strive to grow investment principal without  excess exposure to risk.

            Independent research sets us apart from our peers.  We rely on an experienced team of portfolio managers and in-house research  analysts to build solid investment portfolios and to identify investment  opportunities. Analysts evaluate company growth potential, which includes:  market share prospects, financial condition, key components of earning and cash  flow growth, execution of management’s vision, and competitive advantage.  Buy and sell decisions are based on our  proprietary GRAD Point™ valuation methodology that combines the fundamentals of  research with macroeconomic influences.  Please  find our Equity Strategies below:
                  
Large-Cap Growth  Equity: Designed for the  long-term investor seeking opportunities within large to mid capitalization  companies. Typical portfolios consist of 35-45 stocks with a distinct sector  focus.

Core Plus: The Core Plus strategy provides growing income  through a dynamic blend of dividend-paying common stocks and investment-grade  fixed income obligations with a goal of preserving capital and producing competitive  returns.

Large-Cap Core  Equity: This strategy's  goal is to grow income, preserve capital and produce competitive returns. This  strategy is derived from the equity allocation of the Core Plus portfolio.

Small/Mid-Cap  Core Equity: The Small/Mid  Cap Core Equity strategy's goal is to grow income, preserve capital and produce  competitive returns. This strategy is the small to mid capitalization  counterpart of the Large-Cap Core Equity portfolio.

Equity Income Strategy:  The Equity Income Strategy’s goal is to grow  income and preserve capital with low volatility investments.  The strategy focuses upon high dividend  paying stocks having a strong prospect of consistent dividend growth and a  rising income stream.  The holdings may  also include REIT’s, MLP’s and fixed income securities.



Balanced
In balanced accounts, the first decision is to  determine asset allocation. Mastrapasqua Asset Management will work with the  clients to establish long-term asset allocation ranges and target guidelines  for equity securities, fixed income securities, and cash equivalents.  Alternatively we can work with a client’s established guidelines. The firm  utilizes high quality fixed income securities in an effort to reduce overall  portfolio volatility and to provide for current income requirements. Stocks are  used to seek capital appreciation (i.e.: 60% equity/40% fixed, etc.).          
            
Fixed Income
We are  a core fixed income manager whose style is characterized as having a top-down  and value-oriented bias toward high credit quality portfolios for both our  taxable and tax-exempt clients. We first focus on the current economic  environment and strategically allocate fixed assets based on anticipated  changes in the environment. We use asset allocation, yield curve positioning,  duration management, and credit quality as our major portfolio factors. We  consider various forms of economic data such as monetary policy, interest rate  environment and investor sentiment to gain perspective on the bond market.

            We then tailor the portfolio to own the securities that reflect  the investor’s specific needs. These targets include: portfolio maturity,  effective duration, overall portfolio quality rating, and sector weightings.  Finally, we use relative valuation to determine the attractiveness of individual  securities. This process results in a strategically structured portfolio that  best fits the risk and return objectives of the client.

 
Independent Research

Independent  research gives Mastrapasqua Asset Management a competitive advantage.  Mastrapasqua relies on an experienced team of portfolio managers and in-house  research analysts to build solid investment portfolios and to identify investment  opportunities. Analysts evaluate company growth potential, which includes:  market share prospects, financial condition, key components of earning and cash  flow growth, execution of management’s vision, and competitive advantage. Buy  and sell decisions are based on a proprietary process that combines the  fundamentals of research with macroeconomic influences.
  
Our Morning Meetings…
…begin  with coffee and multiple copies of The Wall Street Journal and Investor's  Business Daily.  The portfolio managers  and analysts have arrived one by one, settling in at the large conference table  surrounded by glass walls and windows with a view of the morning traffic as  downtown Nashville wakes up. Following a greeting to the traders the  conversation starts slowly as calls with news from "the street" are  received. By all accounts, a typical morning research meeting, right? Wrong.

              It is Frank Mastrapasqua's experience and love for teaching  that creates a morning research meeting like none other. The themes of economics  and business fundamentals are interwoven with the incoming information in a  unique way that challenges Mastrapasqua's analysts to think beyond the sound  bites. Knowledge is shared, and learning is a priority. Questioning is  encouraged, and the mood of the meeting often takes on that of a classroom in  an institution of higher learning. It is an atmosphere of openness and respect.

            What makes our company unique is the fact that our investment  team meets daily compared to most money managers who meet weekly.  Thus, the flow of information regarding names  in the portfolio is continuously scrutinized.
 
Proprietary Valuation Model: GRAD Point™  Methodology 

Mastrapasqua's independent research team utilizes a  proprietary valuation methodology, Growth to Risk-Adjusted Differential (GRAD  Point™), for stock selection. The GRAD Point™ model evaluates absolute and  relative company market valuations by determining those factors that contribute  positively or negatively to valuation. The GRAD Point model is an enhancement  over customary valuation measures. 

Risk-Adjusted  P/E:  Mastrapasqua Asset Management builds on the  traditional price/earnings ratio (P/E) to growth rate benchmark to create a  quantitative model, which incorporates a multitude of company, financial, and  industry variables to either raise or lower the P/E, hence calculating a  risk-adjusted P/E. 

Macro  Risk-Adjusted P/E:  The  risk-adjusted P/E multiple is further adjusted based upon macroeconomic  variables and trends, intending to capture the impact of the economic  environment on corporate valuations. The macroeconomic adjustment evaluates the  interest rate environment relative to a stock’s volatility (beta). A more  volatile stock’s risk-adjusted P/E will be decreased more when interest rates  are falling, and conversely, increased more when interest rates are rising relative  to a less volatile stock.

GRAD  Points™:  The macro  risk-adjusted P/E is then compared to the projected 5-year earnings growth rate  for the company. Stocks with growth rates higher than the macro risk-adjusted  P/E are rewarded with positive GRAD Points. The outcome is a ranking system  that delineates valuation reasonableness across industry and sector groups.

Company Description


Mastrapasqua Asset Management (MAM) is a sector-focused, growth manager. Analysts evaluate company growth potential including market share prospects, financial condition, key components of earning and cash flow growth, execution of management's vision and competitive advantage. Buy and sell decisions are based on a proprietary process that combines the fundamentals of research with macroeconomic influences.In choosing equities, MAM utilizes their proprietary GRAD Point valuation methodology. This system relies on internally-derived independent corporate research and an assessment of the current economic, political and market environments. They identify quality companies with proven competitive advantage, profitability and compelling valuations. MAM builds on the traditional p/e ratio to growth rate benchmark to create a quantitative model that incorporates a multitude of company, financial and industry variables to either raise or lower the p/e and calculate a risk-adjusted p/e. The risk-adjusted p/e multiple is further adjusted based upon macroeconomic variables and trends, intending to capture the impact of the economic environment on corporate valuations. The macroeconomic adjustment evaluates the interest rate environment relative to a stock's beta. A more volatile stock's risk-adjusted p/e will be decreased more when interest rates are falling, and conversely, increased more when interest rates are rising relative to a less volatile stock. The macro risk-adjusted p/e is then compared to the projected 5-year earnings growth rate for the company. Stocks with growth rates higher than the macro risk-adjusted p/e are rewarded with positive GRAD Points. The outcome is a ranking system that delineates valuation reasonableness across industry and sector groups.Though not limited by sector, MAM tends to invest in the stocks of Us mid-cap and large-cap companies in the electronic technology, technology services, health technology, finance and consumer services sectors. The firm maintains a medium turnover rate.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
