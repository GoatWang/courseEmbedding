Description:

The present invention relates to novel organic compounds and compositions which inhibit renin, processes for making such compound, synthetic intermediates employed in these processes and a method of treating hypertension with such compounds. BACKGROUND ART Renin is a proteolytic enzyme synthesized and stored principally in a specific part of the kidney called the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Any of three different physiologic circumstances may cause the release of renin into the circulation: (a) a decrease in the blood pressure entering or within the kidney itself; (b) a decrease in the blood volume in the body; or (c) a fall in the concentration of sodium in the distal tubules of the kidney. When renin is released into the blood from the kidney, the renin angiotensin system is activated, leading to vasoconstriction and conservation of sodium, both of which result in increased blood pressure. The renin acts on a circulating protein, angiotensinogen, to cleave out a fragment called angiotensin I (AI). AI itself has only slight pharmacologic activity but, after additional cleavage by a second enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), forms the potent molecule angiotensin II (AII). The major pharmacological effects of AII are vasoconstriction and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, a hormone which causes sodium retention. AII is cleaved by an aminopeptidase to form angiotensin III (AIII), which, compared to AII, is a less potent vasoconstrictor but a more potent inducer of aldosterone release. Inhibitors of renin have been sought as agents for control of hypertension and as diagnostic agents for identification of cases of hypertension due to renin excess. With these objectives in mind, the renin-angiotension system has been modulated or manipulated, in the past, with ACE inhibitors. However, ACE acts on several substrates other than angiotensin I (AI), most notably the kinins which cause such undesirable side effects as pain, "leaky" capillaries, prostaglandin release and a variety of behavioral and neurologic effects. Further, ACE inhibition leads to the accumulation of AI. Although AI has much less vasoconstrictor activity than AII, its presence may negate some of the hypotensive effects of the blockade of AII synthesis. Inhibition of other targets in the renin-angiotensin system such as AII with compounds such as saralasin can block AII activity, but would leave unimpaired and perhaps enhance the hypertensive effects of AIII. On the other hand, there are no known side effects which result when renin is inhibited from acting on its substrate. Considerable research efforts have thus been carried out to develop useful inhibitors of renin. Past research efforts have been directed to renin antibodies, pepstatin, phospholipids and substrate analogs such as tetrapeptides and octapeptides to tridecapeptides. These inhibitors either demonstrate poor activity in inhibiting renin production or poor specificity for inhibiting renin only. However, Boger et al. have reported that statine-containing peptides possess potent and specific renin inhibiting activity (Nature, Vol. 303, p. 81, 1983). In addition, Szelke and co-workers have described polypeptide analogs containing a non-peptide link (Nature, Vol. 299, p. 555, 1982) which also cause potent renin inhibition and show a high specificity for this enzyme.

Most of the compounds of the invention may be made as shown in Scheme I. The amino diol intermediate 5 represents a transition-state mimic for the Leu-Val scissile bond of the renin substrate, angiotensinogen. Incorporation of this amine into the angiotensinogen sequence in place of Leu-Val-Ile-Protein provides potent inhibitors of human renin. For example, acylation of amine 5 with an acyl-Phe-His-OH residue or other appropriately modified amino acid derivatives produces small peptide analogues which are potent renin inhibitors. ##STR7## More particularly, the process shown in Scheme I discloses an N-protected-aminoaldehyde 1 (P1 is an N-protecting group) which is treated with an ylide to give the corresponding allylic amine 2. Oxidation gives diol 3 (P2 and P3 are both hydrogen), N-deprotection gives 4; and free-basing gives amine 5. Either intermediate 4 or 5 can be converted to 7 by standard peptide coupling methods. The same sequence (3-7) can be carried out with hydroxy protecting groups present (where P2 and/or P3 are O-protecting groups), the final step then being O-deprotection. Alternatively, allylic amine 2 may be N-deprotected, peptide coupled using standard methods to give 6, and then oxidized to give the desired peptide diols 7. The protected aminodiol fragment may be alternatively prepared as shown in Scheme II. Aldehyde 9 (prepared, for example, by oxidation of alcohol 8) is converted to its cyanohydrin 10. Addition of an organometallic reagent (such as a Grignard reagent) and acidic workup provides ketone 12. Reduction of ketone 12 then provides the desired protected aminodiol 13. ##STR8##   The following Examples will serve to further illustrate preparation of the novel compounds of the invention.

The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or anic acids. These salts include but are not limited to the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, lucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptonate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be guaternized with such agents as loweralkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides, and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl., and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which may be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. Other salts include salts with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium or with organic bases. The compounds of the present invention can also be used in the form of esters. Examples of such esters include a hydroxyl substituted compound of formula I which has been acylated with a blocked or unblocked amino acid residue, a phosphate function, or a hemisuccinate residue. The amino acid esters of particular interest are glycine and lysine; however, other amino acid residues can also be used. These esters serve as pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention and serve to increase the solubility of these substances in the gastrointestinal tract. The preparation of the pro-drug esters is carried out reacting a hydroxyl-substituted compound of formula I with an activated amino acyl, phosphoryl or hemisuccinyl derivative. The resulting product is then deprotected to provide the desired pro-drug ester. The novel compounds of the present invention possess an excellent degree of activity and specificity in treating renin-associated hypertension in a host. The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit human renal renin can be demonstrated in vitro by reacting a selected compound at varied concentrations with human renal renin, free from acid proteolytic activity, and with renin substrate (human angiotensinogen) at 37° C. and pH 6.0. At the end of the incubation, the amount of angiotensin I formed is measured by radioimmunoassay and the molar concentration required to cause 50% inhibition, expressed as the IC50, is calculated. When tested in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the compounds of the invention demonstrated IC50 's in the range of 10-5 to 10-10 M as seen in Table I.

Total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, from 0.001 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily and more usually 0.01 to 1 mg. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. The foregoing is merely illustrative of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the disclosed compounds. Variations and changes which are obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope and nature of the invention which are defined in the appended clams.
