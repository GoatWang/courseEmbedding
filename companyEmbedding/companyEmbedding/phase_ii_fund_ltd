Iroko Pharmaceuticals Announces Financial Investment in New Product Development
October 6, 2010


PHILADELPHIA, PA, October 6, 2010 — Iroko Pharmaceuticals, LLC, supported by a new investment group including a private equity fund advised by Kew Capital LLP and Phoenix IP Ventures-III, LLC, will continue to market its well established branded products Aldomet® (methyldopa), Indocin® (indomethacin) and the Canadian rights for the antibiotic Vancocin® (vancomycin hydrochloride). In addition, the Company will focus significant new investments into its advanced pipeline of pain management products. The Company is planning to make strategic investments to grow its core business, including expanding use, gaining approval in additional countries and/or acquiring new assets.
The additional funding invested into Iroko Pharmaceuticals will enable the Company to increase its focus on the development of products formulated using its partner’s, iCeutica Inc., proprietary SoluMatrix™ Platform for the creation of nano particle products. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for three development programs. Two of these programs have successfully completed Phase II trials and are commencing their Phase III trials in 2011.
Iroko President and CEO, John Vavricka, said “Today’s announcement reflects our excitement surrounding the new investment and revived focus on our near term pipeline and our existing revenue generating products. This confirms our mission to deliver relevant and needed products to patients.”
“We are very pleased to have a strong and aligned financial partner in Kew. This relationship will allow us to deliver on the promise of Iroko Pharmaceuticals near term pipeline and focus on becoming a leading specialty pharmaceutical company in the space of NSAID pain relief,” stated Iroko Pharmaceutical’s Chairman and Senior Managing Partner of Phoenix IP Ventures, Osagie Imasogie. “These changes allow us to drive forward the development of our nano particle formulations for the treatment of various acute and chronic pain conditions while continuing to build our overall business.”
About Iroko Pharmaceuticals, LLC: Iroko is a pharmaceutical company focused on specialty therapeutic areas. The company acquires, develops and maximizes the potential of currently marketed pharmaceutical products. Iroko increases the revenues of acquired products through focused selling and marketing efforts and product life cycle management activities including development of relevant formulations to improve patient treatment. Iroko currently has three products under development, formulated by iCeutica’s proprietary SoluMatrix™ Platform technology.
About Kew Capital LLP: Kew Capital is a private investment advisor formed in 2008. Kew advises on a global portfolio of investments including bonds, listed and private equities, funds, listed and OTC derivatives, structured products and real estate.
About Phoenix IP Ventures: A fully integrated Private Equity and Venture Capital Fund which specializes in life sciences, principally in the pharmaceutical sector.

Blueberry Therapeutics commence Phase I-II clinical trial of lead product BB2603











Blueberry Therapeutics are pleased to announce they have dosed the first patient in a Phase I/II clinical trial of BB2603 in fungal infection of the skin and nail following successful regulatory and ethics approvals. The trial, which is a safety and efficacy study in onychomycosis (fungal nail infection) and associated tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), began on March 28th 2017, with primary and secondary endpoints expected to read out during the second half of this year.
BB2603 is an innovative new treatment concept using nanotechnology to deliver terbinafine, a potent antifungal, through the nail and into skin to treat fungal infection. This novel patented nanomedicine will initially be used to treat onychomycosis which is a highly infectious disease with a high medical need that is currently poorly managed by current treatments.
Dr Mike Davies, Chief Medical Officer and co-founder of Blueberry Therapeutics, said, “This is a great achievement by the team at Blueberry that has led to approvals and the start of our first clinical trial with BB2603 – our exciting, novel nanoformulation of terbinafine to treat onychomycosis and associated tinea pedis”
Progression of the lead product into the clinic has been a major step forward for Blueberry in the development of its lead topical anti-fungal. The resultant data will be used to support the opening of an Investigational New Drug Application later this year in the United States.
John Ridden, CEO of Blueberry Therapeutics said, ‘This is an exciting time for Blueberry – we are making excellent headway in the development of BB2603 to establish its effectiveness in treating onychomycosis and associated tinea pedis. These are highly infectious fungal diseases which affect a large number of patients. Current treatments can take up to 18 months, have poor efficacy or cause unpleasant side effects. We hope that BB2603 will provide a safe and very effective alternative.’
Blueberry will be seeking to raise a further £30m in 2018 to run phase III clinical development planned to take place in 2019.
Andrew Kay Chairman of Blueberry commented, ‘There remains high medical need for an effective drug to topically treat fungal nail infection, and we look forward to fundraising following the current clinical trial to enable Blueberry to enter phase III development for this major blockbuster market.’

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
