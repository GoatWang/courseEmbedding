Bain Capital Buys 50% of TOMS
TOMS Founder and Chief Shoe Giver Blake Mycoskie has announced that the company has completed the sale of a 50 percent equity stake to a leading private investment firm, Bain Capital. The partnership and investment support will accelerate the growth of the company and its giving programs around the world, with Mycoskie continuing as visionary of the company and the 50% owner of TOMS.


Founded in 2006, TOMS began as a shoe company that matched every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need – One for OneTM. Since then, TOMS’ giving has grown to serve other basic needs. TOMS Eyewear gives sight to a person in need with every pair of eyewear purchased, and TOMS Roasting Co. gives one week of clean water to a person in need for every bag of coffee purchased. To date, TOMS has given over 35 million new pairs of shoes to children in need and helped restore sight to more than 275,000 people.


“The partnership with Bain Capital will bring added resources and expertise to allow us to accelerate the growth of our company and the One for One mission globally,” said Mycoskie. “We are seeing increased demand for our products and brand and this partnership will help us meet that demand as we expand product categories and grow our distribution and retail footprint in key target countries internationally.”


“TOMS is very clearly the leading mission-driven company. It has a brand that stands for social impact in an authentic, unique and resonant way. We look forward to partnering with Blake and his team to grow the business while simultaneously growing and supporting the impact of its mission,” said Ryan Cotton, a Principal at Bain Capital.


TOMS’ current retail partners commented positively on the agreement. James C. Estepa,   President and Chief Executive Officer, T he Journeys Group, said, “TOMS is an incredibly unique company with a strong social cause at its core, which continues to resonate with our customers both in the U.S. and in Europe. We’re proud that Journeys has played an important role in the global success of TOMS thus far, and we expect that our relationship will only strengthen given the investment from Bain Capital.”


"We have enjoyed a great relationship with TOMS as the company has grown over the years and we really value the passion they bring to their business and our partnership. Our customers continue to respond positively to their product line, and TOMS’ socially aware mission has always resonated with our customer,” said Scott Meden, EVP and GMM of shoes, Nordstrom. “The partnership with Bain Capital will help enable TOMS to invest in product development, and we look forward to continuing to evolve our partnership in the future.”


About TOMS


In 2006, American traveler Blake Mycoskie befriended children in a village in Argentina and found they had no shoes to protect their feet. Wanting to help, he created TOMS, a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need. One for One.® Since then, TOMS has given 35 million pairs of new shoes to children in need.


Five years later, TOMS realized this movement could serve other basic needs and launched TOMS Eyewear. With every pair purchased, TOMS will help give sight to a person in need. One for One.® Since launching, TOMS has helped save or restore the sight of more than 275,000 people worldwide.


In 2014, TOMS launched TOMS Roasting Co. For each bag of coffee beans sold a person will get clean water for a week, and for every cup of coffee sold someone gets water for a day.

What is 'Absolute Return'
Absolute return is the return that an asset achieves over a certain period of time. This measure looks at the appreciation or depreciation, expressed as a percentage, that an asset, such as a stock or a mutual fund, achieves over a given period of time. Absolute return differs from relative return because it is concerned with the return of a particular asset and does not compare it to any other measure or benchmark.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Absolute Return'
      The absolute return refers to the amount of funds that an investment has earned. Also referred to as the total return, the absolute return measures the gain or loss experienced by an asset or portfolio independent of any benchmark or other standard. Returns can be positive or negative and may be considered uncorrelated to other market activities.Relative and Absolute ReturnsIn general, a mutual fund seeks to produce returns that are better that its peers, its fund category and the market as a whole. This type of fund management is referred to as a relative return approach to fund investing. The success of the asset is often based on a comparison to the chosen benchmark, industry standard or overall market performance.As an investment vehicle, an absolute return fund seeks to make positive returns by employing investment management techniques that differ from traditional mutual funds. Absolute return investment techniques include using short selling, futures, options, derivatives, arbitrage, leverage and unconventional assets. Absolute returns are examined separately from any other performance measures, so only gains or losses on the investment in question are considered.History of Absolute Return FundAlfred Winslow Jones is credited with forming the first absolute return fund in New York in 1949. In recent years, this so-called absolute return approach to fund investing has become one of the fastest-growing investment products in the world and is more commonly referred to as a hedge fund.Hedge FundsA hedge fund is not a specific form of investment; it is an investment structured as a pool and set up as either as limited partnership or limited liability company (LLC). A hedge fund manager raises funds by working with outside investors. The manager uses the funds to invest based on a declared strategy involving only the purchase of long equities, such as common stock.Hedge funds may specialize in specific areas, such as real estate or patents, and may also engage in private equity activities. While anyone may invest in a hedge fund, participants are traditionally accredited and sophisticated investors.

Overview






Investment Approach
The Fund aims to achieve positive absolute returns through a combination of capital growth and income on your investment regardless of market conditions. The Fund seeks to gain at least 70% of its investment exposure to shares of companies domiciled in, or the main business of which is in, emerging markets. This is achieved by investing at least 70% of its assets in shares, other equity-related securities and when determined appropriate fixed income (FI) securities, money market instruments (MMIs) deposits and cash. The equity-related securities include financial derivative instruments (FDIs).

All currency hedged share classes of this fund use derivatives to hedge currency risk. The use of derivatives for a share class could pose a potential risk of contagion (also known as spill-over) to other share classes in the fund. The fund’s management company will ensure appropriate procedures are in place to minimise contagion risk to other share class. Using the drop down box directly below the name of the fund, you can view a list of all share classes in the fund – currency hedged share classes are indicated by the word “Hedged” in the name of the share class. In addition, a full list of all currency hedged share classes is available on request from the fund’s management company.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund invests a large portion of assets which are denominated in other currencies; hence changes in the relevant exchange rate will affect the value of the investment. Compared to more established economies, the value of investments in developing Emerging Markets may be subject to greater volatility due to differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability. The strategies utilised by the Fund involve the use of derivatives to facilitate certain investment management techniques including the establishment of both 'long' and 'synthetic short' positions and creation of market leverage for the purposes of increasing the economic exposure of a Fund beyond the value of its net assets. The use of derivatives in this manner may have the effect of increasing the overall risk profile of the Funds. Investors in this fund should understand that the Fund is not guaranteed to produce a positive return and as an absolute return product, performance may not move in line with general stock market trends as both positive and negative share movements affect the overall value of the fund. The Manager employs a risk management process to oversee and manage derivative exposure within the Fund. The Fund may be exposed to finance sector companies, as a service provider or as counterparty for financial contracts. Liquidity in the financial markets has been severely restricted, causing a number of firms to withdrawn from the market, or in some extreme cases, becoming insolvent. This may have an adverse affect on the activities of the fund. The fund may invest in smaller company shares which can be more unpredictable and less liquid than those of larger company shares.

Absolute Return Funds




Expand the strategies in a portfolio with absolute return funds, that pursue positive return targets using tools that seek to reduce their risk.
Absolute return funds offer an alternative to more traditional stock, bond, or balanced funds. An absolute return strategy is independent of traditional benchmarks such as the S&P 500 Index or the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which gives it the freedom to invest in a wide variety of securities as well as a variety of strategies to hedge specific types of risk. The funds may have lower volatility over time and are designed to operate independently of market direction. Putnam is the first mutual fund company to offer a suite of four absolute return funds designed for all kinds of investors.
Putnam's approach

We offer a suite of four absolute return funds that may be considered as alternatives to stock funds, bond funds, or balanced funds.
The funds can provide investment diversification as an anchor to any portfolio, and serve as a complement to traditional relative return funds. 
Putnam portfolio managers have experience in managing absolute return strategies over multiple market cycles.
