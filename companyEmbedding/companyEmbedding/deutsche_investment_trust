Money Market Funds





Yields fluctuate and are not guaranteed. Money market 7-day current yield is the annualized net investment per share for the period shown. The compound yield is calculated similarly but when annualized, the income earned by an investment in the fund is assumed to be reinvested. Gains and losses are not included. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the total return quotation. The nonsubsidized yield reflects what the yield would have been had a fee and/or expense waiver not been in place during the period shown. The fees and/or expenses have been waived in an effort to increase the fund’s net yield. 
Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal fluctuate so your shares may be worth more or less when redeemed. Current performance may differ from the data shown. Adjusted returns reflect the maximum sales charge. Unadjusted returns do not reflect sales charges and would have been lower if they did. For the fund's most recent month-end performance, click the "performance" tab below. Current performance may differ from the data shown.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 .00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. You should not rely on or expect the Advisor to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the fund's $1.00 share price. The credit quality of the fund's holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the fund's share price. The fund's share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. The actions of a few large investors in one class of shares of the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the share prices of all classes of shares of the fund. See the prospectus for specific details regarding the fund's risk profile. 

Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PS*Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PRS*  Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional MGD* * This is a sub-group of the Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional class. The legacy share class reference is maintained only for recordkeeping, operational convenience and efficiency.
For the above funds  the advisor has agreed to waive expenses. If the advisor had not waived expenses, yields would have been lower. Recent and any future declines in interest rate levels could cause these funds' earnings to fall below the funds' expense ratio, resulting in a negative yield. The advisor has agreed to voluntarily waive expenses as necessary to maintain a positive yield. This waiver may be changed or terminated at any time without notice.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest. 
Nothing contained herein is fiduciary or impartial investment advice that is individualized or directed to any plan, plan participant, or IRA owner regarding the advisability of any investment transaction, including any IRA distribution or rollover.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.
