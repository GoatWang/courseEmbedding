Could Not Ask for More

John Croft & Noel Blanchard

















John Croft and Noel Blanchard  noticed a friend’s social media posts  about doTERRA essential oils, and  were intrigued by the way the oils were  described and how they were being  used. These posts later motivated them  to purchase a small kit of essential oils  for themselves. They say, “We went  crazy from there.”Though they had tried essential oils  before, the purity, strength, and  potency of doTERRA essential oils  was noticeably different. They began  to use the products in their daily  lives and even got a diffuser for their  home. They say, “We were product  users first; however, this changed very  rapidly. We had so many friends and  acquaintances asking us how they  could get some of what they were  smelling and experiencing.”John and Noel were amazed at how  organically they were able to share the  oils and decided to start a doTERRA  business together. In previous years  they had owned and operated a  small retail business and facilitated  workshops and meditation groups.  Now, their doTERRA business has  allowed them to work together again  while using some of their former work  experiences and passions. Because  of the strong relationship John and  Noel have built, they recognize and  utilize each other’s strengths and fully  support one another in their business.  They have also found that keeping in  constant communication is key.Another central aspect to John and  Noel’s success is their dedication to  being true to themselves. They explain,  “Don’t try to do something that is not  you. It’s more genuine when it’s coming  from a place of integrity and honesty.  Feel what feels right for you and trust  that.” John and Noel live this principle to



“We love sharing our passion far and wide, nationally and internationally. We love seeing people have experiences with an oil so pure that it literally changes their lives.”


the fullest as they make their business  and workshops fun, informative,  and unique to them. Aside from  sharing essential oils, they also have  a passion for cacao and meditation.  They incorporate their passions into  their business by creating a nurturing  space at their workshops. They provide  chocolate, scents, ambience, and blends  that cultivate the senses while sharing  the essential oils they love.John and Noel enjoy sharing such a  pure product while working together  and with their amazing team. They say,  “Traveling the world and sharing our  love of the product is a dream come  true. We do this all while seeing so many  people’s lives change for the better. You  can’t ask for more than that!”





SIMPLE STEPS TO BECOMING A BETTER LEADER




ATTEND REGULAR BUSINESS TRAININGS.
“Familiarize yourself with the business side. There can be 
a bit to learn at first, but it’s vital to know the basics of placements, the back office, compensation, tools for 
sharing, and business building techniques.”


BE A USER AND A BUILDER.
“Use the products in everyday life to gain knowledge and 
personal experience.”


HAVE A PLANNING AND TRACKING SYSTEM. 
 “Having some sort of tracking and planning system is 
key. We used a whiteboard to show columns of leaders and the Elites under them, and would then write down 
changes to our OV (team volume) each day. It made it easy to plan events and support each person effectively.”


KEEP THE INSPIRATION ALIVE.
“Read motivational and inspirational books to help keep the fire 
in your belly.”

CROFT Leadership | One Stop Shop













































































CROFT Leaders































Mr. Preston Croft
Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Preston Croft graduated from Sul Ross State University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Petroleum Geology, with a minor in Physics. Mr. Croft has over 40 years of oil and gas industry experience, with extensive knowledge in exploration, wellbore completions, production facility design, artificial lift evaluations, and property economics. In 1986 Mr. Croft formed the company Mid-American Production Company where he personally obtained 107 producing wells and managed an additional 350 wells for outside clients. Ultimately, Mr. Croft invented the first Passive Dehydration System and made the decision to sell Mid-American Production Company and became the Founder of Croft Production Systems, Inc. in 2006. Mr. Croft currently serves as CROFT’s Chief Executive Officer and is a well-respected member of CROFT’s Leadership Team. Mr. Croft’s main focus is to enhance CROFT’s growth and overall financial performance, while improving CROFT’s products and services to meet industry needs.

Mr. Cameron P. Croft
President and Chief Operating Officer
Mr. Cameron P. Croft graduated from University of Houston with a Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering Technology and holds a Master’s of Science Degree in Technology Project Management with a black belt in Lean Six Sigma. Mr. Croft joined Croft Production Systems, Inc. in 2006 with a vision to work his way from a Service Technician to CROFT’s current President and Chief Operating Officer. Under Mr. Croft’s leadership, CROFT has moved from specializing in Passive Dehydration Systems, to an all-inclusive production and processing company. Mr. Croft holds extensive training in multiple technical and supervisory field roles, including experience in design and product engineering. Mr. Croft provides strategic leadership, management, and the vision necessary to ensure CROFT has the proper operational control, administration, and procedures in place. Mr. Croft’s main focus is to grow a solid team and operate efficiently to keep up with industry demand and to continuously improve CROFT products, designs, and processes to maintain a solid foundation.

Mr. John Christopher Smithson
Director of Engineering
Mr. Smithson graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering Technology. He joined CROFT’s Engineering Team in 2011, with a vision to improve CROFT products and designs for production equipment. During Mr. Smithson's tenure with CROFT, he was promoted several times, and currently holds the role of Director of Engineering. Under his leadership, the CROFT Team has launched three new product lines; CROFT’s Chemical Injection System (for which he personally received a patent), Fuel-gas Conditioning System, and Ambient Cooling System, as well as improving the designs of the Gas Sweetening System and Joule Thomson System product lines. Mr. Smithson’s expertise and leadership includes consulting on multiple oil and gas projects around the world, plus CROFT’s technology advancements by implementing the latest 3D CAD design/analysis software, product data management, along with process simulation software for Chemical and Hydrocarbon processes. Ultimately, Mr. Smithson’s main focus is to continue to improve CROFT’s products and designs to meet with industry demand.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
