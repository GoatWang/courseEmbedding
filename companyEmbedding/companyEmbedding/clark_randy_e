         Baptized In the Spirit



Author:

Dr. Randy Clark



SKU: BIS

God's Presence Resting Upon You With Power... “Are you filled with the Holy Spirit?”

	Sadly, there has been much division surrounding this one question. Many believe that the Holy Spirit in-dwells a person at the moment of their conversion. Others contest that baptism in the Holy Spirit is a separate experience altogether. Apostolic leader, theologian and healing minister, Randy Clark, shares about how this controversial and often misunderstood experience can be accessible to all Christians - including you!

          About Randy Clark
        









Bio
Randy Clark, a noted international speaker, is a graduate of United Theological Seminary, where he received his D.Min. in 2013. He also received his M.Div from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and his bachelor's degree was in Religious Studies from Oakland City University. He was used of God to birth the revival that broke out in Toronto, Canada, in January 1994 that continued six nights a week for over twelve years.Randy is best known for the gift on his life for activating and imparting gifts of the Holy Spirit. The late John Wimber was the first to recognize this grace on Randy's life. John heard the audible voice of God tell him twice that Randy would one day travel the world laying hands on pastors and leaders to activate and impart to them gifts of the Spirit. Randy also continues to demonstrate the Lord's power to heal the sick with great tenacity. While having been used to launch several famous ministers into the new level of their anointing by laying hands on them and prophesying to them, the focus of his ministry is on the average person in the congregation, encouraging them that they too can be used of God in the gifts of the Spirit, especially words of knowledge and healing. His message is simple: "God wants to use you."He is the author of "There Is More" and many other books, manual/workbooks, booklets and materials. He is the co-author with Bill Johnson of two books, "The Essential Guide to Healing" and "Healing Unplugged". His book, "There Is More" is now being used as a textbook at the United Theological Seminary (a United Methodist Seminary) for one of the courses taught by Dr. Andrew Sung Park. Dr. Park is also going to use "The Essential Guide to Healing" in his seminary course.
