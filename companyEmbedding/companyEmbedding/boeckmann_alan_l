Alan L. Boeckmann

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Alan L. Boeckmann served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Fluor Corp. between 2002 and 2011. He retired from Fluor in 2012.[1]
Mr. Boeckmann became employed by the company in 1979 and served in various positions before his appointment as the Chief Executive Officer. These positions included President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer of Fluor Daniel, and Group President, Energy & Chemicals. In addition to his service with Fluor, he also serves as a director of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and BHP Billiton.[2]
Immediately upon his employment at Fluor, he began working on an Exxon fuels expansion project. Because he began the project at the office and then relocated to the worksite in Baytown, Texas, he was able to oversee the project from beginning to end. Within a few years of employment, he gained experience from travelling around the world to locations such as South Africa and Venezuela to work on various projects. One of his accomplishments involves the initiation of the company's use of a three-dimensional plant design that increased the company's global effectiveness.[3]
Boeckmann joined the board of BP in 2014.[1]
Education[edit]
Mr. Boeckmann attended the University of Arizona and received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering.[4]
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Fluor in 2009, Alan L. Boeckmann earned a total compensation of $9,443,358, which included a base salary of $1,248,042, a cash bonus of $6,873,200, stocks granted of $2,133,083, options granted of $2,133,020, and other compensation of $265,933.[5]

In addition to his service with Fluor, he also serves as a director of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and BHP Billiton.[2]
Immediately upon his employment at Fluor, he began working on an Exxon fuels expansion project. Because he began the project at the office and then relocated to the worksite in Baytown, Texas, he was able to oversee the project from beginning to end. Within a few years of employment, he gained experience from travelling around the world to locations such as South Africa and Venezuela to work on various projects. One of his accomplishments involves the initiation of the company's use of a three-dimensional plant design that increased the company's global effectiveness.[3]
Boeckmann joined the board of BP in 2014.[1]
Education[edit]
Mr. Boeckmann attended the University of Arizona and received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering.[4]
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Fluor in 2009, Alan L. Boeckmann earned a total compensation of $9,443,358, which included a base salary of $1,248,042, a cash bonus of $6,873,200, stocks granted of $2,133,083, options granted of $2,133,020, and other compensation of $265,933.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
