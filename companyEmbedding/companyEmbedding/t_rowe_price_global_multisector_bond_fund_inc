				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are based on the most recent fiscal year-end data available.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
Offers higher yield potential than money market or shorter-term bond funds but with more volatility. Yield and share price will vary with interest rate changes.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk.To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.



Investor Profile
For investors seeking to enhance the performance of their fixed-income portfolios and willing to take on the special risks associated with high-yield bonds and foreign securities.    Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are based on the most recent fiscal year-end data available.

Benefits & Risks
Offers higher yield potential than money market or shorter-term bond funds but with more volatility. Yield and share price will vary with interest rate changes.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk.To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.



Investor Profile
For investors seeking to enhance the performance of their fixed-income portfolios and willing to take on the special risks associated with high-yield bonds and foreign securities.    Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
Offers higher yield potential than money market or shorter-term bond funds but with more volatility. Yield and share price will vary with interest rate changes.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk.To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.



Investor Profile
For investors seeking to enhance the performance of their fixed-income portfolios and willing to take on the special risks associated with high-yield bonds and foreign securities.    Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
Offers higher yield potential than money market or shorter-term bond funds but with more volatility. Yield and share price will vary with interest rate changes.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk.To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.



Investor Profile
For investors seeking to enhance the performance of their fixed-income portfolios and willing to take on the special risks associated with high-yield bonds and foreign securities.    Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
Offers higher yield potential than money market or shorter-term bond funds but with more volatility. Yield and share price will vary with interest rate changes.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk.To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.



Investor Profile
For investors seeking to enhance the performance of their fixed-income portfolios and willing to take on the special risks associated with high-yield bonds and foreign securities.    Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRSNX

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.
If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse USD Hedged Index




Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

				Morningstar rated the Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund among 
298,
298,
253
and 
N/A
World Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			



2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
	

^ T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a 
portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to 
fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other 
T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each 
fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price
mutual funds.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity® list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
4. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
5. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
6. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
