                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Chiropractic Care Helps People Of All Walks Of Life
 

 
 
 


We Improve Your Health & Help Protect Your RightsChiropractor, Dr. Mario Marsilio, DC, has treated all sorts of pain from various causes. If you have been injured in some sort of an accident and are experiencing back or neck pain, headaches, sciatica or any other type of pain, Dr. Marsilio wants to make sure you have excellent medical care as well as excellent legal representation. In 32 years of professional experience, working with insurance companies and attorneys, Mario has learned who to refer people to—and who NOT to refer people to. If you’ve been in an accident, please allow us to refer you to legal professionals who really do work for YOU and have YOUR best interests in mind.
 A Unique, Friendly EnvironmentWhen you come in to our office, you’ll notice right away that this chiropractic office is a little different. You’ll likely be greeted by Sherry, the receptionist and indispensable assistant to Dr. Marsilio, whose ready smile and quick wit will make you feel right at home.
Invariably, you’ll hear laughter echoing throughout the building, while Dean Martin music is piped through the offices. Clients tend to hang around and chat a while. Nobody’s a stranger here.
 Compassionate, Pain-Free CareDr. Marsilio makes all the difference. To most, he’s just plain “Mario.” He always makes time to really check in with the people he serves, to see how they’re really doing. Your very first meeting with the doctor, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much time he spends getting to know your background and specific needs. He takes his time explaining and answering questions. Mario’s out-going Italian personality, coupled with his years of professional experience, make him a unique and effective doctor who is just plain fun to be around.
