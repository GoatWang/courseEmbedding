                              nervous system. Physiology has thus far been essentially the physiology of Vertebrates. I am convinced, however, that for
                              the establishment of the laws of life-phenomena a broader basis is necessary. Such a basis can be furnished only by a comparative
                              physiology which includes all classes of the animal kingdom. I have added at the end of each chapter a list of the chief papers
                              of which I have made use. Although far from complete, this may serve the beginner as a guide for the further study of the
                              subjects touched upon"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)

                           On the occasion of the inauguration of the new buildings of the Medical School of Harvard University in Boston, President
                              Eliot and Dr. J.J. Putnam, professor of the diseases of the nervous system, asked me to deliver before the students some lectures
                              about pathological psychology. I greatly appreciated this honour, and tried to sum up before the American students some elementary
                              psychological researches about a well-known disease, hysteria, in order to show them how the study of the mental state of
                              the patient can sometimes be useful to explain many disturbances and to give some unity to apparently discordant symptoms.
                              The fifteen lectures presented in this book were given in the Harvard Medical School between the fifteenth of October and
                              the end of November, 1906. Some of these lectures were also delivered in Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore, at the request
                              of Professor J.M. Baldwin, and in the medical school of Columbia University in New York, at that of Professor Allen Starr.

                              "This book lays no claim to be a comprehensive treatise upon the psychology of insanity. The number of independent schools
                                 of thought existing at the present day, and the fundamental divergence in their methods of investigation, make it obviously
                                 impossible to compress such a treatise into the limits of a small volume. All that has been attempted here is the presentation
                                 of certain recent developments in abnormal psychology which have already yielded results of fundamental importance, and which
                                 seem to offer an exceptionally promising field for further investigation. Many of the theories to which he will be introduced
                                 have not as yet been firmly established. A very large number of the general principles enunciated in this book are due to
                                 the genius of Prof. Freud of Vienna, probably the most original and fertile thinker who has yet entered the field of abnormal
                                 psychology. Although, however, I cannot easily express the extent to which I am indebted to him, I am by no means prepared
                                 to embrace the whole of the vast body of doctrines which Freud and his followers have now laid down"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database

                              "This lecture proposes to deal with human nature working under difficulties, and to choose one small portion of that broad
                                 problem. I should like to interest you in some facts rather than in words, in a sample of the real stuff of human life rather
                                 than in the traditional and threadbare phrases with which we too often disguise the actual world, giving ourselves a pleasing
                                 illusion of knowledge. I ask you, therefore, to consider our topic to be not "mental disorders," but men, women, and children
                                 in difficulty, suffering, hoping, thwarted, groping. Many people are suffering from a mental disorder, who in the current
                                 estimate of their friends are considered only as eccentric, model, disagreeable, extreme, wicked, virtuous, emancipated, etc.
                                 The same situation is met in regard to other disorders. In referring to a reaction as a mental disorder we do not necessarily
                                 mean that the condition is severe or serious. Mental disorders may be mild, just as physical disorders may be; mental indigestion
                                 may be of as many degrees as physical indigestion, and an emotional disturbance may be as mild as an attack of chicken-pox.
                                 Mental disorder may masquerade under many disguises, and human nature in difficulties may resort to many subtle evasions and
                                 modes of defense; we are so much under the spell of old-fashioned conceptions of human behavior that the real driving forces
                                 of the personality escape us, while we label behavior with the conventional ethical or social terms. There are a group of
                                 patients, of people who recognize that they are sick, and come to the physician for treatment; they admit that they have a
                                 disorder, but they are perhaps indignant at the suggestion that their trouble is mental. Their symptoms may have nothing mental
                                 about them, but may be the ordinary symptoms of respectable ailments; they come for their headache or dizziness or weakness,
                                 or they have palpitation or fainting attacks, or their digestive system is a source of much interest and annoyance, or they
                                 have indications that some of the other internal organs are out of gear. Yet these apparently simple symptoms may be of complex
                                 origin; they may be the outcroppings above the surface of important emotional reactions, only to be understood in the setting
                                 of these reactions. We have to discard our mediæval attitude toward these sick or handicapped people, and to study the problem
                                 which they present as a problem of human nature working under difficulties. We have to study the disordered behavior of the
                                 total organism in the same way in which we study the disordered behavior of a single organ. When we come to those far-reaching
                                 disorders of the personality in which the patient suffers from profound melancholy, or gives way to exuberant excitement,
                                 or is dominated by sounds or voices of subjective origin, or sees the world banded against him in a strange web of persecution,
                                 the principles of explanation so far utilized seem to leave us in the lurch. Neither structural damage, nor chronic poisoning
                                 of the brain, nor simple disorder of the instincts explains these specifically human disorders. A modern attitude to these
                                 ailments means that at the earliest indication of trouble, when treatment has most chance of being useful, these patients
                                 will be encouraged to seek advice, where there are available suitable facilities for diagnosis and treatment"--Book. (PsycINFO

                              "Since the year 1910 there has been in progress at Nancy a psychological and medico-pedagogical movement which we are entitled
                                 to regard as one of the notable scientific happenings of the present epoch. The terms autosuggestion, the education of the
                                 will, the force of thought, self-control, have long been current. But with the rise of the New Nancy School we have for the
                                 first time the elements of a really methodical synthesis of the phenomena and the disciplines which these terms connote. The
                                 pioneer in this development is a man whose devotion is rivaled by his modesty. During the years 1885 and 1886, Emile Coue
                                 witnessed the work and the experiments of Liebault, who was, as everyone knows, the father of the doctrine of suggestion,
                                 the founder of the first Nancy school, and the teacher of Bernheim. By the closing years of the nineteenth century, Coue had
                                 grasped the thought of which he was in search. He discovered in autosuggestion the powerful and widely diffused force of which
                                 hypnotic suggestion, the only form of suggestion hiitherto studied in medicine, is but one among many applications"--Preface.

SCHLESINGER--Edward S. The Rockefeller University deeply mourns the loss of Edward S. Schlesinger, a beloved friend, trusted advisor, and generous benefactor. Ed served as a member of the University's Committee on Trust and Estate Gift Plans for thirty-five years, and was a passionate advocate for the University and its mission to improve human health through scientific research and education. His incisive wit and keen intelligence will be missed by all in the Rockefeller community who had the privilege to know Ed. Over many decades, his tireless efforts and visionary philanthropy helped to advance numerous programs at Rockefeller, including research related to cancer, autism, and vaccine development. Ed was also the devoted father of distinguished Rockefeller faculty member Dr. Sarah "Sally" Schlesinger. We extend heartfelt condolences to Sally and the entire Schlesinger family. Russell Carson, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Marc Tessier-Lavigne, President Barry S. Coller, Physician-in-Chief James I. Black, Chair, Committee on Trust and Estate Gift Plans Marnie Imhoff, Vice President
