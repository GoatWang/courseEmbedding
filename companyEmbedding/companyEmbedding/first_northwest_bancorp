First Northwest Bancorp: Inexpensive Valuation With Three Key Catalysts - First Northwest Bancorp (NASDAQ:FNWB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»First Northwest Bancorp: Inexpensive Valuation With Three Key CatalystsSep.17.15 | About: First Northwest (FNWB) Hemlock Partners Long only, valueSummaryWe view the small-cap bank sector as a secular growth story.Despite a strong capital position and attractive credit metrics, FNWB trades at just 83% of tangible book value.A number of shareholder-friendly catalysts exist; expect the first, a share repurchase announcement, in 1Q16.Community Banks Are Long-Term Winners
The Hemlock team remains extremely bullish on community banks. We believe the entire sector has and will continue to benefit from three key trends over the next several years - improving credit, loan growth, and consolidation.
We prefer the neighborhood banks over the national entities for two reasons. First, generally speaking, the smaller firms maintain relatively straightforward balance sheets, avoiding many of the elaborate, hard to assess assets and liabilities that are typically present at the national institutions. In essence, we believe the community banks are more transparent; and therefore, provide us greater confidence in the reported book value, and ultimately, are easier to value.
Second, when evaluating real estate, we believe there is significant value in local market knowledge and only the community banks can consistently provide this level of expertise. As loan growth increases across the sector, we are betting on the local operators to select the best-performing investments.
To ensure we are able to capitalize on this secular growth story, the Hemlock team follows approximately 50 of the most attractive community banks in the United States. We have developed a proprietary system to rank each bank stock based on its five-year appreciation potential. One of our favorites is First Northwest Bancorp (NASDAQ:FNWB).
First Northwest Bancorp
With a market cap of $165 million and $938 million in assets, FNWB operates as the holding company for First Federal Savings & Loan Association. Founded in 1923, the bank serves Western Washington via nine local branches. The business model consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds to originate residential and commercial loans.

Over the last twelve months, FNWB's asset quality strengthened and now has reached elite levels. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio totaled just 0.7% in the most recent quarter versus 0.9% a year ago.
In January 2015, the bank completed its conversion from the mutual to stock form organization. The demutualization process, coupled with a stock offering, raised plenty of capital, which creates a number of near- and long-term catalysts.
Catalysts
With a tangible equity to asset (TE/A) ratio of over 20%, FNWB is overcapitalized relative to our coverage universe (average TE/A ratio of 14%). The substantial liquidity is critical to driving shareholder value as it provides the wherewithal to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and ramp loan growth. Trading at 83% of tangible book value, we expect FNWB to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter of 2016. By law, the company must wait one year from completion of the demutualization to begin to buy back shares.
At the current valuation, every share repurchased will be immediately accretive. As we inch closer to January 2016, the one-year anniversary of the conversation, the multiple will increase as the market anticipates a stock buyback announcement. The combination of actual repurchases and the multiple boost should provide a double-digit return over the next 6-9 months.
With a multi-year investment horizon, the return potential looks even better. We expect FNWB to follow the path of so many other shareholder-friendly demutualized banks. The company will continue to repurchase shares as long as they trade below tangible book value.
Subsequently, FNWB is likely to issue a dividend, attracting a whole new class of income-focused investors willing to award the bank a healthier valuation multiple. The combination of dividends, stock repurchases, and multiple expansion is quite likely to please long-term equity holders who purchase shares at current levels.
Two to three years down the road, we view the acquisition of FNWB as a very realistic possibility. As we mentioned in a previous article (Here Comes the Sun (NASDAQ:SNBC) (Bancorp)), the banking community is in midst of a challenging situation.

Despite a low net interest margin environment, there are limited organic growth opportunities available. Further, rising compliance costs are encouraging banks to increase assets, thereby spreading the expense over a larger base. As banks look to expand, the most logical approach is to acquire smaller peers. For an acquirer, FNWB offers tremendous excess capital and a high-quality portfolio.
Conclusion
FNWB is one of the most attractive banks in our coverage universe. Despite a strong capital position and attractive credit metrics, the company trades at less than 85% of tangible book value. Due to its small market capitalization, FNWB is anonymous to most and a compelling opportunity for the value-centric investor.
