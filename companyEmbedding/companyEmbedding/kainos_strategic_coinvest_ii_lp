The Kainos team is committed to a deeply held set of investment principles and a disciplined adherence to a time-tested investment strategy that is driven by the following three core values: Sector Focus, Change Capital, and Risk Management.



Sector Focus
We will invest in manufacturers and marketers of food products as well as other consumer products businesses where the Kainos team has substantive experience.  We firmly believe that specialization and sector focus are critical to generating attractive and consistent returns for our investors.  With over 100 combined years of focus on the food and consumer products sectors, the Kainos team has invested in or operated businesses within essentially every subsector of the food industry.  This experience enables us to develop an informed perspective on virtually any type of investment opportunity.  This sector specialization has allowed the Kainos team to more effectively identify and execute on investments that are undermanaged or identify opportunities for investment that are underappreciated by the broader market.

Thesis Based Investing
Our investment process begins with the development of specific investment theses within the food and consumer sectors.  These investment theses are informed by the experience gained through the team’s dedicated sector focus, our extensive industry network, and our collective investing and operating experience in the industry. We proactively develop relationships with companies that fit within our investment theses.

The Kainos Partners were amoung the first in the private equity industry to invest behind the following trends in the food and consumer industry:


Mainstreaming of organicfood movementGrowth in protein consumptionand sports nutrition productsRetailer focus onprivate label



[+] More




Our strategy is to build a diversified portfolio of growing and strategically relevant food and consumer businesses.





Change Capital
We seek to provide “Change Capital” to each of our portfolio companies. The primary source of returns from our team's investments has been our operationally oriented and hands-on approach in working with management teams to drive earnings growth at our portfolio companies and build companies of strategic value.  This strategy is inseparably connected to our ability to identify undermanaged or underappreciated companies which will benefit from our operational focus.  This Change Capital strategy is expected to enable our portfolio companies to be transformed and repositioned into strategically relevant companies that should be of strong interest to trade buyers or the public markets.

As part of the due diligence phase and underwriting process, Change Capital initiatives are identified and a Change Capital-based operating strategy developed to increase the sales and profitability and optimize the assets of each company.  This active strategy requires intense operational focus and action:

Invest in manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to fully capitalize on market opportunities
Develop new products and sales channels to grow revenues
Develop new marketing programs to reinvigorate tired brands
Eliminate redundant costs to increase profitability
Invest in automation and lean manufacturing to drive efficiency
Manage the revenue mix towards higher margin products
Divesting non-core assets to optimize assets
Monetize excess working capital
Pursue strategic acquisitions that leverage the infrastructure of the business
Augment management team as needed



[+] More



Risk Management
The Kainos investment process and criteria are designed to provide a stable and consistent platform on which our portfolio companies can create growth.  In implementing this objective, leverage is used prudently to ensure our portfolio companies remain long-term and productive participants in their communities. 



Over our collective careers, virtually every exit of a food portfolio company has been to a trade buyer or to the public markets.

The article is called Fireman Capital Cpf Hudson Co-Invest Lp Just increased Joe’s Jeans Inc Position and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/fireman-capital-cpf-hudson-co-invest-lp-just-increased-joes-jeans-inc-position/193388/.CaptchaSubmitFireman Capital Cpf Hudson Co-Invest Lp increased Position in Joe's Jeans Inc (NASDAQ:JOEZ)

Why Fireman Capital Cpf Hudson Co-Invest Lp Holds Joe's Jeans Inc (NASDAQ:JOEZ)

Purpose of Transaction 
Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended andrestated in its entirety as follow:
Fireman acquired the Subordinated Convertible Notein September 2013 for investment purposes pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which he, together with theother holders of equity interests in Hudson Clothing, sold their interests in Hudson Holdings to the Issuer. TheSubordinated Convertible Note is convertible until March 31, 2019 into shares of Common Stock (at the rate of $1.78 pershare), cash, or a combination of cash and Common Stock, at the Issuer’s election. It was estimated that, if theprincipal amount owed on the Subordinated Convertible Note as of July 1, 2015 had been converted to Common Stock on July1, 2015, approximately 5,708,231 shares of Common Stock would have been issuable to Fireman.

According to Schedule A of the Rollover Agreement, as of July 1,2015, the principal amount of the Subordinated Convertible Note held by Fireman was $10,160,654 and the accrued interest owed thereonwas $348,556.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by theRollover Agreement is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary conditions.The Rollover Agreement will be automatically terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement prior to the Rollover Time. TheRollover Agreement may also be terminated by the Issuer or by Mr. Kim and Fireman if the Rollover Time has not occurred prior toApril 8, 2016.
Modified Convertible Notes
The Modified Convertible Notes will be structurally and contractuallysubordinated to the Issuer’s senior debt and will mature five and a half years following the date of such notes. The ModifiedConvertible Notes will accrue interest quarterly on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 6.5% per annum (to be increasedto 7% as of October 1, 2016 with respect to the Modified Convertible Note issued to Fireman), which will be payable 50% in cashand 50% in additional notes; provided, however, that the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay 100% of such interestin cash. Beginning upon the date of issuance, the Modified Convertible Notes will be convertible by each of the holders into sharesof Common Stock, cash, or a combination of cash and Common Stock, at the Issuer’s election.
If the Issuer elects to issue only shares of Common Stock upon conversionof the Modified Convertible Notes, each of the Modified Convertible Notes would be convertible, in whole but not in part, intoa number of shares equal to the conversion amount divided by the market price. The conversion amount is (a) the product of (i)the market price, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (A) the principal amount, divided by (B) the conversion price, minus (b) theaggregate Issuer optional prepayment amounts paid to the holder. The market price is the average of the closing prices for theCommon Stock over the 20 trading day period immediately preceding the notice of conversion. If the Issuer elects to pay cash withrespect to a conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes, the amount of cash to be paid per share will be equal to the conversionamount. The Issuer will have the right to prepay all or any portion of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Modified ConvertibleNotes at any time so long as it makes a pro rata prepayment on all of the Modified Convertible Notes.
Registration Rights Agreement
In addition, it is anticipated that upon the Effective Time,Fireman, together with other holders of Convertible Notes and TCP Denim, LLC, an affiliate of Tengram Capital Partners, L.P., whohas agreed to purchase $50 million of a new series of the Issuer’s Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement, willenter into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Issuer, providing Fireman, together with other holders of Subordinated ConvertibleNotes and TCP Denim, LLC,

the right to require the Issuer to prepare and file a registrationstatement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in order to register the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the relevantconvertible notes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer will provide certain demand registration rights toregister the shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the Rollover Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of the ModifiedConvertible Notes and Series A Preferred Stock of the Issuer, on registration statements on Form S-1 or Form S-3, subject to certainlimitations as described therein, and will also provide certain piggy back registration rights.
No assurances can be given that the Merger will be consummatedon the anticipated timeline or at all. If the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, the substantive provisionsof the Rollover Agreement will immediately terminate.
