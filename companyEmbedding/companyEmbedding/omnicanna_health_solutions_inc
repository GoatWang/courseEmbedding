											Over The Counter Products									



The Hempery, a brand owned and operated by OmniCanna Health Solutions, develops products for the over the counter market for hair and skin with hemp seed oil as its main ingredient.
The Hempery products truly are nature's perfect skin care because they contain an abundance of pure hemp seed oil and coconut oil. Hemp seed oil has been called "nature's perfect food for humanity." A rare protein known as globule edestins is found only in the hemp seed and it mimics the globulin found in blood plasma. Hemp contains all the essential amino acids necessary for human life. Coconut oil also contains a unique combination of fatty acids with powerful medicinal properties. Skin is the largest and fastest growing organ in the body. Since skin absorbs a large part of what we put on it—why not use the most regenerative and nourishing substances available? The base of all the products in The Hempery collection is the unique pairing of hemp seed oil and coconut oil—an ultra nutritious treat for the skin. Your skin can now experience the miracle of their benefits every day.
 

Line of Products
 HEMPERY MIRACLE OIL HMO is made with a unique formulation of plant and flower oils that are revitalizing for the skin. Apply all over, everyday and watch as your skin regains its radiance. The anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory properties in hemp seed oil make it a superior, all natural skin care solution.
HEMP MILK BODY WASH What do you get when you mix our signature Hempery Miracle Oil (hemp seed oil, coconut oil & lavender) and liquid castile soap? A milky, green, fragrant regenerative cleanser for the skin. This amazing creamy soap literally cleanses AS it moisturizes.
HEMP LOTION BAR A new way to moisturize hands and body. These lovable bars melt with the warmth of your hands, moisturizing and protecting like none other. The cocoa butter, hemp seed oil, coconut oil and lavender are all dynamite for skin while the beeswax works as an emulsifier. Hemp Lotion Bars have a light scent of various essential oils including rose, lavender, and almond.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., May 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- OmniCanna Health Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ENDO) (fka "Endocan Corporation"), a U.S. Company specializing in hemp formulation-based health and wellness solutions, is pleased to announce that the Company's Board of Directors has selected Greta Gaines as its new CEO and President following her appointment to the Board.  The Company takes this action concurrently with the impending release of the Company's new skin care product line:  The Hempery TM. On May 20, 2015 please visit www.thehempery.com to purchase "The Hempery" skin care product line all made in the USA.
The Board has been impressed with the progress and relentless work ethic of Greta since she began.  Her passion and leadership led the Board to its unanimous decision to elect her President and CEO and continue to let her grow the business model.   We are equally pleased to announce that Dr. Dorothy Bray remains on the Board of Directors, and the Company will continue to benefit from Dr. Bray's extensive clinical expertise. Both Dorothy and Greta serve on the Cannabis Science Inc (OTC: CBIS) Advisory Board. Cannabis Science has a vested interest in the success of OmniCanna.
Ms. Gaines' first endeavor as CEO and President is to bring to market a skin care line of products she developed called The Hempery. The skin care items are the Hempery Miracle Oil, the Hemp Milk Body Wash, the Hemp Lotion Bar, Hemp Rose Soap and Hemptastique Lip Balm.  The products' "feels as good as it heals" TM slogan was chosen because they contain an abundance of hemp seed oil and coconut oil—some of the most nutrient and protein rich ingredients available for deep moisturizing of the skin.
The initial release of the products is planned to coincide with the Patients Out of Time Ninth National Clinical Conference on Cannabis Therapeutics, May 21-23, 2015 at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.  Alongside Cannabis Science Inc (OTC: CBIS), The Hempery will have a presence as a sponsor for a golf tournament and products will be available to sample and for sale.   
Ms. Gaines is a well-known businesswoman in the industry.  She is known as an innovator especially in her favorite niche—the hemp market.  She believes in the use of hemp and proudly develops hemp-based solutions. She has the deepest faith in hemp as a valuable and healing commodity.
Greta served on the national board of NORML for 3 years and remains on its advisory board. She is also on the advisory board of Patients Out of Time and Tennesseans United.  Greta has displayed a lifelong pattern of success in business from her early days as the first women's extreme snowboarding world champion to running her own snowboarding camps for women.  Greta went on to produce her own television programming on the shows she hosted for Oxygen and ESPN 2.  She furthers her success in the entertainment industry with multiple southern-rock album releases.  Ms. Gaines has owned and operated her own record label since 1999, through which she has learned marketing, distribution and production. Greta is an artist and has used that talent in her branding and company marketing campaigns, including social media.  Ms. Gaines' opinions are nationally respected in the industry and beyond. She routinely speaks at national industry conventions and educational forums. 
Ms. Gaines appreciates the historical relevance of hemp and how it can positively impact the American economy on a number of levels, from farming to product development and sales. Women are believed to purchase as much as 80% of household products. This makes Ms. Gaines' renowned voice in the market vital to the Company, as the Company believes that women will be the first to invest in and use OmniCanna products. 
"My relationship with the Company and its Board has been amazing since the beginning; I was privileged to be brought onto the team a couple of years ago when OmniCanna Health Solutions purchased some of my products.  It is an honor to have made the progress we have and I am excited at what the prospects are for the company going into 2016," stated Ms. Gaines, Director, President and CEO, OmniCanna Health Solutions, Inc. 
"The timing is perfect for Greta's appointment which comes right as we have gotten final approval to release The Hempery products.   We feel that our financial filings, delayed because of a third-party auditor issue, will be up to date and current by the end of the year.  We are confident that we will also benefit from a full line of products and cash flow," stated Robert Kane, Director and CFO.
The name, OmniCanna Health Solutions™ is a revitalized name of the Company from Endocan Corporation. The Company website has changed accordingly to www.omnicanna.com. 
About The Hempery
The Hempery products truly are nature's perfect skin care because they contain an abundance of pure hemp seed oil and coconut oil. Hemp seed oil has been called "nature's perfect food for humanity." A rare protein known as globule edestins is found only in the hemp seed and it mimics the globulin found in blood plasma. Hemp contains all the essential amino acids necessary for human life. Coconut oil also contains a unique combination of fatty acids with powerful medicinal properties. Skin is the largest and fastest growing organ in the body. Since skin absorbs a large part of what we put on it—why not use the most regenerative and nourishing substances available? The base of all the products in The Hempery collection is the unique pairing of hemp seed oil and coconut oil—an ultra nutritious treat for the skin. Your skin can now experience the miracle of their benefits every day.
About OmniCanna Health Solutions, Inc.OmniCanna Health Solutions, Inc. is currently developing new natural hemp based products based on innovative formulations to utilize the unique and potent benefits of the hemp plant. Medicinal properties of hemp have been known and applied for thousands of years. With the aid of scientific research, OmniCanna Health Solutions is translating such knowledge into development of effective hemp formulation-based health and wellness solutions as well as cosmeceutical, nutraceutical, and food brands throughout the world. The Company's health and wellness, nutritional, and cosmetics lines will address personal needs and will evolve with the introduction of new formulations and products, advancing the Company within the expanding multibillion-dollar global market.
