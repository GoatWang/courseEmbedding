HomeAbout UsExecutive Leadership 






EcoStim Energy Solutions has assembled a team of industry professionals with over 100 years of combined experience in oilfield service, including key executives with a particular emphasis on the hydraulic fracturing business. We are currently establishing operational strongholds in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico.

J. Chris Boswell
President & CEO

With more than 28 years of executive management experience in the oilfield-services industry, Mr. Boswell has helped grow numerous successful businesses. As the CFO of Petroleum Geo-Services, he helped expand PGS' operations into new international markets and secured over $3 billion in capital to facilitate the company’s rapid growth—including greater than 30 percent market share in the global marine seismic market while growing revenues to over $1 billion. He also completed over $1 billion in mergers and acquisitions and listed the Company’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Following PGS, he co-founded Particle Drilling Technologies and completed a reverse merger IPO and secured over $35 million in capital to test the Company’s patented technology. During his term as the Co-founder and CFO, he successfully listed the Company’s shares on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange and generated a research following with such names as RBC Capital Markets & Morgan Keegan.
Following Particle Drilling Technologies, Mr. Boswell took on a turnaround project at a Kleiner Perkins portfolio company, Neos Geo-Solutions. During his term there as CFO, he helped recruit a new CEO and secure $60 million in secondary financing, which included investors such as Bill Gates. He also worked closely with Carlos Fernandez to negotiate a major contract with ExxonMobil in Argentina, a key development in the Company’s successful turnaround.
Mr. Boswell is a 1985 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin.

Barry Ekstrand
Chief Operations Officer

Mr. Ekstrand serves as Chief Operations Officer, with responsibility for the overall leadership of EcoStim's operations. He has extensive experience in the well completions segment with 35 successful years at Halliburton, Weatherford, Key Energy Services and CRS Proppants, where he delivered strong business growth through application of innovative technology solutions.
Among his accomplishments, Mr. Ekstrand built Weatherford's Fracturing Technologies group from a startup in 2003 to a $600+ million business line, making it one of the industry leaders in pressure-pumping services. Prior to joining EcoStim, he served as President of New Chemical Technologies for a Houston-based private equity fund where he leveraged new chemical processes for improved well economics. Mr. Ekstrand is a Registered Petroleum Engineer, holding a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering as well as an MBA from California State University.
 





Alexander Nickolatos
Chief Financial Officer

Before joining EcoStim, Mr. Nickolatos was Director of Financial Planning and Analysis at Neos GeoSolutions (Neos), where he also served as Controller and Treasurer, overseeing oil and gas accounting and finance operations in over seven countries including Argentina. In this role, he helped to raise over $500 million from private investors, including Bill Gates, Kleiner Perkins and Goldman Sachs. He was instrumental in implementing the company's subsidiary exploration activities in Argentina, eventually forming an assignment of two concessions to ExxonMobil.
Prior to Neos, he worked for Arthur Andersen and PricewaterhouseCoopers. He is a Certified Public Accountant, and holds a BBA degree, summa cum laude, from Walla Walla University.
 

Craig Murrin
Secretary & General Counsel

Mr. Murrin has over 30 years of experience negotiating a variety of upstream energy-related transactions around the world, including joint ventures, acquisitions and divestitures, and financings for energy companies and energy-service providers. He was Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of Global Geophysical Services, Inc. (GGS) from May 2005, when it commenced business, until October 2008. He helped GGS raise over USD 100 million in private equity and USD 180 million of secured debt, establish an international operating company in the Cayman Islands, establish an FCPA compliance program, and enter the geophysical service business in Algeria, Argentina, Georgia, India, Oman and Peru.
Mr. Murrin served as Vice President-Legal of various subsidiaries of Petroleum Geo-Services ASA from 1997 until 2003 and as its chief compliance officer from 2000 to 2003, helping it to enter the geophysical service business in Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. From 1988 to 1995, he was Senior Counsel and Assistant Secretary of The Western Company of North America, where he helped it enter the pressure-pumping and offshore drilling businesses in Argentina, Brazil, China, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Russia through joint ventures and technology and equipment transfers. He received his law degree from Stanford University, where he served on the Law Review. Mr. Murrin is a member of the Association of International Petroleum Negotiators and served on the council of the international section of the Houston Bar Association from 2003 through 2009.

Carlos Fernandez
Executive VP - Corporate Business Development and General Manager Latin America

Mr. Fernandez has 35 years of experience in the oil and gas industry and over 30 years of experience in various executive management and sales positions. From January 2010 to present, he has worked as General Manager – Latin America for NEOS GeoSolutions, a silicon valley backed oilfield technology company. From April 2006 to November 2009, he served as Senior Vice President Business Development for 3DGeo. While at 3D-Geo, Carlos led the formation of the Kaleidoscope seismic imaging project, a partnership among Repsol, 3D-Geo, Stanford University, IBM, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. From 1996 to March 2006, he served as General Manager – Latin America for Paradigm Geophysical. From 1990 to 1995, Mr. Fernandez served as President of Petroleum Information Argentina. From 1979 through 1990, he held various leadership positions with seismic technology and computing companies such as Silicon Graphics.
Mr. Fernandez received his degree in geophysics with honors from the National University of La Plata in Argentina. He taught at the University for more than 10 years, contributing to the education of a significant number of geophysicists currently working in the oil and gas industry in Latin America and around the world.

Bobby Chapman
Vice President of Corporate Development and M&A

Mr. Chapman began his career with Halliburton, where he was involved in drilling and completions operations, sales, engineering, and management in offshore Gulf of Mexico and broad U.S. land operations as well as assignments internationally in offshore West Africa. His experience includes high-pressure / high-temperature well cementing, stimulation engineering (matrix acidizing and fracturing) and completion design, including complex, extended-reach and deep water. He authored several SPE technical papers on the use of high-perm well-completion techniques and processes.
In 1998, he joined Weatherford International where he spent seven years in management involved in artificial lift and general business planning. He was responsible for the organic startup of Weatherford’s well-stimulation business.
After leaving Weatherford, Mr. Chapman started Liberty Pressure Pumping, a startup business focused on well stimulation of unconventional resources. He was involved in all phases of the business including strategic planning, financial planning, equipment design, sales, engineering and management. Liberty’s niche was supplying well-stimulation operations to the Barnett Shale but later expanded to other unconventional U.S. plays. In 2007, Liberty was sold to Trican Well Service for more than $300 million.
Mr. Chapman was retained by Trican to serve as president of the U.S. region. During this time Trican added several operating regions and expanded product line offerings to include cementing and coil-tubing services. Mr. Chapman is a 1979 graduate of Louisiana State University with a B.Sc. in Petroleum Engineering.


Miguel Di Vincenzo

Mr. Di Vincenzo has 28 years of executive experience in oilfield services focused primarily in Latin America. Most recently, he served as VP - Business Development & Technology for San Antonio International. He also led the engineering team responsible for the research and development of applied technologies for E&P Services which included fracturing, cementing, coiled tubing and directional drilling.
Prior to that, he spent seven years with Pride International as Operations Director for Latin America where he developed integrated solutions for mature fields operated by Pemex, Repsol, PDVSA, Eco-petrol and others. Prior to Pride International, he spent his early career working for San Antonio Services where he held various engineering, operational and management positions in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela including such services as pumping, cementing, underbalance and directional drilling, coiled tubing, wire line, fishing tools and integrated services.
Mr. Di Vincenzo has published numerous technical papers regarding coiled tubing, directional drilling and underbalanced drilling applications. He is currently the president of the Latin American Chapter of ICOTA (International Coiled Tubing Association).
He received a Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Mar del Plata in Argentina, a graduate degree in Oil and Gas Reservoirs from University of Zulia in Venezuela and graduate studies in Business Administration from Stanford University.
