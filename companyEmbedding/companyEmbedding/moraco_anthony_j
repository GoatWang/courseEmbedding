Anthony J. Moraco (CEO)



Chief Executive Officer
Anthony J. Moraco










Tony Moraco is chief executive officer of SAIC, a position he has held since the company separated from its former parent in September 2013.
Moraco joined SAIC in 2006 and served in numerous leadership positions prior to his appointment as CEO. He has vast experience leading programs serving Department of Defense, federal and civilian agencies and the intelligence community, including U.S. Air Force space missions, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
Before joining SAIC, Moraco was with the Boeing Co. from 2000 to 2006. There, he served as deputy general manager of mission systems in the Space & Intelligence Systems organization, as well as the director of Homeland Security Technology Integration. In these roles, he led a wide array of programs focused on space ground segments, geospatial technology, and homeland security solutions.
Moraco began his career at Autometric, Inc. in 1984 and served in multiple positions, including senior vice president for Corporate Development with management authority of corporate departments. He also developed geospatial production and imagery exploitation solutions. From 1992-1993, Moraco was a program manager at TASC for a National Geospatial Intelligence Agency contract for enhanced digital mapping solutions.
He serves as a board member for the Northern Virginia Technology Council and the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) and is past chairman of the Defense Industry Initiative on Business Ethics and Conduct Steering Committee, former board member of Operation Homefront, and has served on engineering advisory boards at Virginia Tech.
Moraco earned a master’s degree in geodetic sciences and a bachelor’s degree in civil and environmental engineering (CEE) from Virginia Tech and was inducted into the CEE Academy of Distinguished Alumni in 2014.
SAIC is a premier technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering, intelligence, and enterprise information technology markets.

Anthony J. Moraco, CEO of SAIC (SAIC), Presents at Cowen 35th Annual Aerospace/Defense & Transportation Conf. - The Wall Street Transcript











































 






































Anthony J. Moraco, CEO of SAIC (SAIC), Presents at Cowen 35th Annual Aerospace/Defense & Transportation Conf.
February 5, 2014
Anthony J. Moraco, CEO of SAIC (SAIC), and CFO John R. Hartley presented on Wednesday at the Cowen & Co. 35th Annual Aerospace/Defense & Transportation Conference at the InterContinental New York Barclay, New York City. 
Moraco began the presentation by explaining that SAIC separated into an independent company on September 27, 2013. He said that SAIC is now one of the largest pure play technical services providers to the U.S. government and that the company currently has approximately $4 billion in annual revenue with 90% prime contracts.
Moraco said that the spinoff allows them to protect their base and expand into customers they already know but who they have under served in the past. The spinoff, according to Moraco, creates new access points unencumbered by conflict of interest.
Hartley then explained that company revenue is between $3.85 billion and $4.10 billion with diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.33. Operating cash flow is equal to or greater than $125 million. As of January 31, 2014, SAIC has repurchased 362,723 shares of stock to create shareholder value.
During a question-and-answer period, Moraco said SAIC recovered relatively easily from the government shutdown late last year. SAIC sees the budget deal as essentially neutral, but positive in that it should allow awards to restart. Moraco expects some lift in calendar quarter one and two.
Moraco said he expects numbers to trend up in FY 15. He noted, however, that the first quarter of FY 15 should have a double-digit decrease. This, he said, will be the fourth consecutive quarter of negative double digit numbers. The numbers should then flatten and the company is expecting organic growth in the second half of the year.
Overall, Moraco said SAIC is very pleased with the status of the company post-spin off. The upside for FY 15 will be triggered by award activity, according to Moraco, and he believes SAIC can outperform the market as a whole. The downside would be any surprises from the spin off. However, Moraco believes the downside is offset by the upside.
