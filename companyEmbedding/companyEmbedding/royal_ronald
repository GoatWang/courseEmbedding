Home Fragrances:




There’s no place like home, and yours should be the place you’re happiest and most comfortable. From the furniture to the color and even the sounds of your space, every aspect contributes to its peaceful nature. But, there’s one other important element that defines your home: its scent.
The smell of your house or apartment is unique, yet so much a part of your everyday life many of us forget it even exists. However, it’s essential to create a scent you love that relaxes you the minute you walk in the door after a long day at work—one you immediately recognize as “home.”  By using our high-quality fragrances at Royal Aroma, you can set the mood for any space, whether it’s energizing, soothing, or crisp.
When you use Royal Aroma fragrances, you immediately transform your home into an environment with a sense of self and family, which promotes comfort and peace. Not only does it make the air fresher and easier to breathe, but it contributes to a feeling of positivity and an optimistic ambiance. A home with Royal Aroma is one with added motivation to complete the sometimes-mundane tasks of everyday life, and one which promotes a connection between mind, body, soul, and atmosphere.
Air Care Fragrances:
Fragrance has the power to revive a plain space by transforming the air around you into an inspiring atmosphere. As technology continues to evolve, air care is constantly touted for providing new and better benefits for any home or commercial environment via innovative aroma distribution techniques and odor-neutralizing qualities.
At Royal Aroma, we offer an extensive range of air care fragrance products which incorporate neutralization capabilities in a variety of formats. Thanks to our patented, state-of-the-art technology, we provide a multiplicity of fragrance options, including air sprays, plug-ins, gel air fresheners, membranes, cellulose, and wicks, allowing our customers to pick an air care solution tailored to their specific needs.
Personal Care Fragrances:
Personal care is an incredibly important aspect of everyday life. Not only does it create a more confident sense of self, but it also helps make a positive first impression on others, making personal care products with the highest quality fragrances an invaluable resource.
Whether you’re manufacturing hair and body wash, skin care, deodorants, or other grooming products, Royal Aroma Fragrances’ creative marketing teams can offer product development services backed by the latest market intelligence to help meet even the most rigorous customer needs.
Industrial Fragrances:
When it comes to industrial needs, businesses and public spaces often need an extra boost in the fragrance department to neutralize unpleasant odors. Whether our clients need personalized scents to mask the smell of fuels or chemicals, spruce up household cleaning products, or simply freshen the air, Royal Aroma has the answer.
Our experienced research and development team is fully equipped to support our customers in any sector. One of our core objectives is to design and develop bulk industrial fragrances for a multiplicity of target markets, including laundry detergent, lubricant, and cleaning product manufacturers. Our highly-skilled personnel can assist you in creating your desired fragrance by utilizing the latest technology in conjunction with current market research to ensure you receive the perfect product every time.

Size: 7.75″H (Large)Ronald Wilson Reagan (1911 – 2004) began as an Iowa sports announcer, then worked as a movie actor for 30 years.
