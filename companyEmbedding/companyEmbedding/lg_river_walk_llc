You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Switch,Push Button

							PartSelect Number PS3529268


							Manufacturer Part Number 6600JB1010A


							The interior light in your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, or stays on when the door is closed, you could have a faulty switch. The switch is spring-loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is pushed, and continuity through the switch when it is no longer engaged. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat-blade screwdriver and needle-nose pliers.

							PartSelect Number PS8260240


							Manufacturer Part Number 4581EL2002C

Sensor

							PartSelect Number PS3529161


							Manufacturer Part Number 6500EL3001A


							The sensor controls the temperature in your dryer and will turn off once your clothes have reached the desired dryness level. If you notice that your dryer is not giving off enough heat to dry the clothes or is taking too long to dry, this may indicate that a repair to the senor is required. To access this part, you will need to remove the front bulk head. To remove this, you will need to remove the screws securing the top. Uninstall the screws that support the control panel and lift. Remove screws holding the support bracket in place so you can detach this piece. Detach the wire harness and remove the wire, then set the bracket aside. You will now open the dryer door and release it by taking out the bottom two screws. Disconnect the wire harness and moisture sensor wire harness, remove screws from front bulk head, and remove screws that secure the duct housing. You should be able to completely remove the bulk head. You will find the sensor underneath the lint filter grill, which will also need to be removed.

							This dryer thermistor temperature sensor helps monitor and regulate the temperature inside a dryer. This part includes the wire harness.

The belt wraps the length of the dryer drum, secured by a tension pulley and then loops around the motor pulley. If you find that the drum is not turning properly or at all while your dryer is in succession, it might be due to the belt being broken.

Thermal Fuse

							PartSelect Number PS3530485


							Manufacturer Part Number 6931EL3003D


							This thermal fuse acts as a high-limit thermostat, and shuts off the heating element when the dryer overheats by cutting off power to the dryer. If the thermal fuse has blown, the dryer will not start. These fuses cannot be reset, so if yours has blown, you will need to replace it. A common reason for the thermal fuse to blow on a dryer is if the exhaust vent on your dryer is restricted or blocked. Hot air will be confined in the dryer and the fuse will trip and stop the electricity from flowing to the gas valve or heating element.

Line up the new grill cover with the moisture sensor and the housing on either side, and it should snap into place. Once it is firmly in place, use your screwdriver to put the screws back in.

Pump Gasket

							PartSelect Number PS3535690


							Manufacturer Part Number MFZ32863101


							This is a pump gasket, also known as a pump housing seal, for a dishwasher. The gasket is fitted around the edge of the pump, preventing leakage between the pump housing and the filter housing. Located at the bottom of the dishwasher, the pump circulates and drains water from the dishwasher. Age and dishwasher detergents can dry out the pump gasket and cause it to fail and leak. Leak from the pump is not always noticeable until you remove access panels from your appliance. This part is made of rubber and is black in color. It is an OEM part from the genuine manufacturer.
