Extended warranties are usually very inexpensive and can save you thousands in the future. 
					
						It's simple and inexpensive to purchase extended warranties and one of the smartest ways to protect your investment.

					
					
					Furniture can be
					
					
					
					  large, heavy, and expensive and you probably don't have the special tools or expertise needed to fix them in a crisis. If you can spare a few thousand dollars without batting an eyelash for new 
					
					
					furniture
					
					
					
					should they break tomorrow, don't buy a warranty. But if you're like most of us, protect yourself by purchasing inexpensive extended warranties when you buy a new product and save yourself big money in the long run. 



Professional delivery and installation is available for every product we sell. We would be happy to coordinate delivery and installation for you.

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

 "These frames are a perfect fit for my face. I love them!" 













 Angela (Ohio)






 "Ordered 4 pair of sunglasses because the price was right. One pair is no longer available.  So far I have received the Gucci--OMG-they are spectacular and $200 less than Nordstroms!" 













Benjamin Knipping ()






 ""VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE !!! I received my order today and it took 9 days since I ordered and I ordered it on a weekend - so probably it took one week to process. Ray Ban sunglasses are definitely no fake and the prescription glasses are excellent. I will order again - in a store it would have cost me almost 300$ what I got at ezcontactsusa for less than 100$. AMAZING !!!" "
