Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Appointment of Jon S. Saxe to its Board of Directors

Jul 23, 2015, 09:10 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TUCSON, Ariz., July 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) today announced that Jon S. Saxe has joined its Board of Directors.
Saxe brings to CPP many years of experience from the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and venture capital industries.  He has served as a director of more than 25 companies and currently is a director of several biotechnology companies, including: SciClone Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:   SCLN), where he is chairman; DURECT Corporation (NASDAQ:   DRRX); as well as a number of private companies. He was president of PDL BioPharma (formerly Protein Design Labs), and also was president and CEO of Synergen, a biotechnology company purchased by Amgen.
Prior to his work at biotech companies Saxe was vice president of licensing and corporate development and head of patent law for Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc., where he worked for 29 years.  
Saxe received a B.S.ChE from Carnegie Mellon University, a J.D. from George Washington University School of Law, and a LL.M. from New York University School of Law. 
"We are honored and excited to have Jon Saxe join our board," said Jeff Jacob, chairman of CPP's Board of Directors.  "His broad knowledge of the industry and years of experience both as an executive and in corporate governance will serve CPP well as it continues to grow in the coming years.  The other members of the board and I are very much looking forward to working with Jon."
About Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP)
CPP is developing therapeutics that reduce the risk of cancer.  CPP's approach has been used with great success in other disease categories such as cardiovascular, neurovascular and infectious disease.  Agents that target pre-disease states have helped reduce death rates from these conditions by 50%-70% over the past 30 years.  Just as these other prevention therapies represent the largest-selling drug classes on the market today, CPP believes there is even more potential for therapies that reduce the risk of cancer.  CPP is sponsoring a large Phase III trial in colon cancer survivors and a Phase III trial for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an orphan disease that causes hundreds-to-thousands of colon polyps and has a 100% risk of colon cancer unless treated by surgical removal of the colon/rectum.  CPP is also working collaboratively with non-profit groups to support clinical trials in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, for the prevention of relapse.  Additional information on CPP is available at www.canprevent.com.
