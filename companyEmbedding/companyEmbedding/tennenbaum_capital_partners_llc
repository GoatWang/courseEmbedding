We invest across the capital structure in both privately originated transactions and secondary markets




Special Situations


Finding Value
We invest in companies undergoing operational, financial or industry change through both private lending activities (often referred to as rescue financing) and through secondary market purchases (which we refer to as both deep-value and distressed-for-control investing). We provide rescue financing to companies that do not have easy access to conventional capital sources and generally require capital to avoid a restructuring or insolvency. In our deep-value and distressed-for-control investing, we purchase debt in the secondary market at a discount to what we believe is its intrinsic value. These investments include 1st lien and 2nd lien loans, bonds and other debt-like instruments that may ultimately provide equity in the form of warrants, preferred or common shares or other equity rights.

About Us
TCP Capital Corp. is an externally-managed specialty finance company focused on middle-market lending.  We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company  Act of 1940. Our stock is traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "TCPC". 
 TCP Capital's investment objective is to achieve high total returns through current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. We invest primarily in debt of private, middle-market companies with  enterprise values typically between $100 million and $1.5 billion, including complex situations requiring specialized  industry knowledge. While we invest primarily in senior debt instruments, we have the flexibility to provide financing solutions at any level of the capital structure. With our rigorous approach to due diligence, active investment monitoring and long-term perspective, we are an ideal partner for companies and sponsors seeking a stable source of capital. 
TCP Capital's investment activities benefit from the competitive advantages of our investment advisor, Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (TCP) (www.tennenbaumcapital.com), including the deep skills and diverse  experience of its investment professionals, its proprietary deal flow, and its consistent and rigorous investment process.
 Investment Strategy
TCP Capital's primary investment focus is the origination of and investment in debt securities of performing middle-market companies, building on TCP's established track record of origination of and participation in the original syndication of approximately $10.1 billion of debt securities to 286 companies since 1999. Our investments generally range from $10 million to $45 million per company. 
TCP Capital's target investments are generally in companies with established market positions, proven and differentiated  products and strong regional or national operations. While our focus is on directly originated loans, we also have the  flexibility to invest in secondary-market investment opportunities. 
TCP Capital's focus is primarily on U.S. companies where we believe TCP's perspective, complementary skills and investment experience provide us with a competitive advantage and in industries where TCP sees an attractive risk/reward profile based on macroeconomic trends and existing TCP industry expertise.
