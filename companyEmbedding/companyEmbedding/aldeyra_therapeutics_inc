Our Mission


Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company devoted to improving lives by inventing, developing and commercializing products that treat diseases thought to be related to endogenous aldehydes, a naturally occurring class of pro-inflammatory and toxic molecules. Aldeyra’s lead product candidate, ADX-102 (formerly NS2), is an aldehyde trap in development for allergic conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, and other forms of ocular inflammation, as well as for Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome and Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, two inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism.









Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 






Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome is a rare genetic inborn error of aldehyde metabolism, characterized by severe skin disease (ichthyosis) and neurological disorders. There is no FDA-approved therapy for Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome.

Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis






Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis is a rare but severe and potentially blinding inflammatory disease characterized in part by high aldehyde levels that may cause increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, leading to pain, redness, loss of vision, and other ocular symptoms.

Allergic Conjunctivitis






Allergic Conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that affects more than 20% of the population worldwide. The disease is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva (a membrane covering the front part of the eye), resulting in ocular itching and excessive tear production.

Succinic Semi-aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency 






Aldeyra is also developing a potential therapy for Succinic Semi-aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, a neurological disease caused by genetic mutations that result in elevated levels of succinic semi-aldehyde, a toxic aldehyde that is converted to other metabolites that can cause severe neurological dysfunction.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Aldeyra Therapeutics stock drops 16% after mid-stage trial miss 
Aldeyra Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 16.2% in heavy morning trade Wednesday after the company said its allergic conjunctivitis drug missed its primary endpoint in a mid-stage clinical trial. Still, the company said it planned to move the drug forward into late-stage clinical trials after speaking with regulators in the second half of 2017. Allergic conjunctivitis is a common allergic condition that includes inflammation of a membrane at the front of the eye, causing itching, excessive tears, redness and swelling. The phase 2b trial's primary endpoint required statistically significant improvement in ocular itching and at least one point of absolute improvement on a patient-reported scale. Though those weren't met, patients on the 0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution had statistically significant reductions in ocular itching after allergen exposure, which the company said influenced its decision to push forward into late-stage trials. The response "we believe represents a novel activity profile that addresses late phase inflammation generally not affected by antihistamines," said President and Chief Executive Todd Brady. The trial also tested a 0.1% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution, which reduced itching "generally to a lesser degree," the company said. Aldeyra shares have dropped 19.2% to $4.22 over the last three months, compared with a 3.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Last Patient Dosed in Dry Eye Disease Phase 2a Clinical Trial
Jul 18 17
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the last patient has completed dosing in Aldeyra's single-center, double-blind, randomized Phase 2a clinical trial of ADX-102 in Dry Eye Disease (DED). ADX-102 and other product candidates generated from Aldeyra's aldehyde trap platform sequester and facilitate the degradation of aldehydes, a class of endogenously generated pro-inflammatory mediators that are elevated in DED patients. The Phase 2a clinical trial tested three formulations of topical ocular ADX-102 (0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution, 0.1% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution, and 0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic lipid solution) over 28 days of dosing. The primary purpose of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of ADX-102 in forty-five patients with a reported history of DED. Endpoints included standard signs and symptoms characteristic of DED. Topical ocular ADX-102 is also in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and noninfectious anterior uveitis, two other forms of ocular inflammation.


Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Results from Allergic Conjunctivitis Phase 2b Clinical Trial and Plans for Phase 3 Clinical Testing
Jun 14 17
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. announced results from a Phase 2b clinical trial of topical ocular ADX-102 in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Based on the data from the trial and the differentiated late-phase anti-inflammatory profile of ADX-102 that could apply to a large underserved population with allergic conjunctivitis, Aldeyra currently plans to initiate Phase 3 clinical testing with 0.5% ADX-102 following discussion with the regulatory authorities in the second half of this year. The randomized, dose-ranging, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, conjunctival allergen challenge (ORA-CAC®) Phase 2b clinical trial of 0.1% and 0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution enrolled 154 patients (approximately 50 per arm) with allergic conjunctivitis, including subjects with seasonal and perennial allergies. Relative to levels of ocular itching in the control group, the primary endpoint required statistically significant improvement, and absolute levels of improvement of at least one point on a patient-reported scale of 0 to 4. The trial demonstrated statistically significant efficacy of 0.5% ADX-102 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching over one hour post-challenge (p<0.03), and effect sizes were generally larger than those observed in the prior Phase 2a clinical trial. Relative to vehicle, 0.5% ADX-102 achieved statistically significant reduction in itching at 10, 20 and 30 minutes post-challenge (p values of 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively), exhibiting a late-phase anti-inflammatory profile that was differentiated from standard-of-care antihistamines, which are active around 5 minutes post-allergen challenge. In subjects with seasonal allergy, reductions in itching were up to 0.8 points over vehicle (on a 0 to 4 point scale, p=0.002), approaching the one-point threshold of activity required for achievement of the primary endpoint of the trial. A one-point difference at 5 minutes post-challenge, which has been typically used in antihistamine and corticosteroid allergic conjunctivitis studies for endpoint assessment, represents a 38% improvement in itch score relative to that of the vehicle values observed in the trial. Observed percent improvements in itch score for 0.5% ADX-102 versus vehicle were 23%, 37%, 55%, and 65% at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes post-challenge in seasonal allergy patients. The data suggest that the 38% one-point equivalent threshold was met or exceeded 20 minutes post-challenge and later. 0.1% ADX-102 also reduced itching, but generally to a lesser degree than 0.5% ADX-102, suggesting a dose-related efficacy response that confirms the biological effect of drug. Both concentrations of ADX-102 were generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns observed during the trial.

Our Mission


Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company devoted to improving lives by inventing, developing and commercializing products that treat diseases thought to be related to endogenous aldehydes, a naturally occurring class of pro-inflammatory and toxic molecules. Aldeyra’s lead product candidate, ADX-102 (formerly NS2), is an aldehyde trap in development for allergic conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, and other forms of ocular inflammation, as well as for Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome and Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, two inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism.









Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 






Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome is a rare genetic inborn error of aldehyde metabolism, characterized by severe skin disease (ichthyosis) and neurological disorders. There is no FDA-approved therapy for Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome.

Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis






Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis is a rare but severe and potentially blinding inflammatory disease characterized in part by high aldehyde levels that may cause increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, leading to pain, redness, loss of vision, and other ocular symptoms.

Allergic Conjunctivitis






Allergic Conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that affects more than 20% of the population worldwide. The disease is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva (a membrane covering the front part of the eye), resulting in ocular itching and excessive tear production.

Disease Information for Allergic Conjunctivitis









Succinic Semi-aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency 






Aldeyra is also developing a potential therapy for Succinic Semi-aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, a neurological disease caused by genetic mutations that result in elevated levels of succinic semi-aldehyde, a toxic aldehyde that is converted to other metabolites that can cause severe neurological dysfunction.
