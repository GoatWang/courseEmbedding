Biography  |




 Interview Date:  7/12/2010 
 Corporate executive Teri McClure was born in 1963, in Kansas City, Kansas. She received her B.A. degree from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in marketing and economics and went on to earn her J.D. degree from Emory University School of Law in Atlanta, Georgia. McClure began practicing employment and labor law in Atlanta in 1988, and then began working for the United Parcel Service in 1995, as employment counsel to the Corporate Legal Department.
McClure became vice president of operations for UPS in 1999, the year UPS became a public corporation, and then was vice president of operations for the Central Florida district in 2003. During this time, McClure managed over four thousand employees and was responsible for all aspects of package pickup and delivery in that area. She also held an assignment with UPS Supply Chain Solutions during this time, which was the period that UPS was first expanding its supply chain capacities. From 2004 to 2005 McClure served as Compliance Department Manager for UPS, in which capacity she worked to ensure that the company followed ethical and legal business practices. After that, she was quickly promoted to compliance department manager and then was promoted again to corporate legal department manager. In 2006, McClure became the first African American senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary at UPS. This was at a time when only 15.7% of top corporate executives were women and only 1.6% of them were African American.
McClure has served on the board of the UPS Foundation, which is the charitable arm of the UPS Corporation. She has also served on the board of The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Junior Achievement Worldwide, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Equal Justice Works, and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights. McClure served as co-chair of the Georgia Supreme Courts Committee on Civil Justice and was involved with other civic, religious, and professional organizations.

The United Parcel Service, Inc. founder, Jim Casey, “believed one measure of success is the degree to which we build up others. While building up others, we build up ourselves.” Teri P. McClure, UPS Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary.
The UPS Legal Department, under the leadership of General Counsel Teri P. McClure, recognizes its responsibility to those in the community by providing pro bono legal assistance to those who would not otherwise have access to legal services. “Volunteerism is an important aspect of the UPS culture,” said McClure. Pro bono involvement “is an excellent way for members of the legal department to work on meaningful projects within the community and sustain our culture.”
Each member of the UPS legal department, lawyer and non-lawyer, is encouraged to participate in its pro bono program which is managed by the UPS Pro Bono Committee. The committee is responsible for identifying pro bono opportunities, screening and approving pro bono projects, coordinating training, and tracking participation. Many of UPS’s pro bono engagements are done in partnership with local legal service organizations and/or law firms.
Last year, UPS, a Charter Signatory to the Corporate Pro Bono Challenge℠, hosted a pro bono fair and conducted a panel discussion on the benefits of pro bono. As a result of the fair, UPS partnered with the Pro Bono Partnership of Atlanta and the law firms of DLA Piper (US) LLP and King & Spalding, to provide pro bono services to 15 clients. Twenty-five UPS lawyers and paralegals contributed approximately 100 hours.
In 2007, UPS worked with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, and dedicated to that organization a member of the UPS legal department to become a full-time attorney for four months. While not uncommon practice for law firms, this was an extraordinary commitment to pro bono by a corporate legal department. UPS lawyer Ryan Swift spent four months working in the Cobb County Office of Atlanta Legal Aid as a full-time staff attorney, helping those in need in the metro-Atlanta area. Since the conclusion of this rotation, Swift has continued to volunteer with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society.
UPS has also collaborated with the Truancy Intervention Project (TIP), a child advocacy organization that serves children who are chronically absent from school and, as a result, are at risk of becoming involved with the juvenile justice system. Attorneys from the UPS legal department volunteer their time to serve in the role of guardian ad litem. Through TIP’s Early Intervention Program, UPS volunteers work with school social workers, teachers, and the child’s parents to address the child’s absenteeism. Together, the team develops a comprehensive plan to ensure the child remains in school and to prevent court intervention. In some instances, UPS attorneys also serve as guardians ad litem at educational neglect hearings held in juvenile court. In these hearings, the volunteers further advocate on behalf of the child to ensure compulsory school attendance requirements are met.
The UPS Legal Department has recently become involved with the Georgia Justice Project (GJP). GJP is an unlikely mix of lawyers, social workers, and a landscaping company. Founded in 1986, GJP’s holistic approach—which combines legal representation, social service support, and employment opportunities—seeks to remove legal barriers while simultaneously offering its clients opportunities to re-engage in the communities as neighbors and employees. GJP accomplishes this mission by providing free high quality legal services, ongoing access to social services to clients and their families, and employment opportunities through their company, New Horizon Landscaping.
UPS has also partnered with Alston & Bird and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society to obtain adult guardianships for individuals who are at the end stages of life. UPS and Alston & Bird represented relatives in probate court to get temporary or permanent custody guardianship orders for individuals who were no longer competent to make decisions about their care and other matters. To date, UPS has been 100 percent successful in obtaining guardianship orders on behalf of clients. The collaboration between UPS and Alston & Bird has also allowed Atlanta Legal Aid’s Health Law Unit to expand the scope of services available to the client population to include caregivers affected by the life-threatening illness of a loved one.

Public Records Now can help you learn about an individual’s past using the criminal records check feature on the site.  Our goal is to collect information from a variety of sources and put it all together into an intensive report that summarizes what the individual has in their background.  Every report will have specific details regarding any crimes an individual might have committed or been involved in. The report will also include their age, gender, name and any identifiable markings.
When the information is available, the report will include:

The offense that was charged
The location of where the offense occurred
Whether the offense was a misdemeanor or a felony
Whether the individual was actually convicted of the crime or not
What the risk level is for any sex offenders

Overview of a Background Check
Criminal searches can be extremely helpful in a number of different situations.  Some of the common reasons why an individual would need someone to perform a criminal background check are:

To gather information about people who are going to interact with you or the members of your family
To learn more about whether the individual has a criminal conviction
To investigate someone’s past that you are planning to date or currently dating
To look into a new person in your neighborhood
Business related ventures
And much more

Based on what you can see, a number of reasons exist as to why you might want to perform a criminal background check on an individual.  Regardless of what it is that you need to check for, you can rely on the professionals at Public Records Now to provide you with the most accurate and comprehensive information relating to someone’s past.
