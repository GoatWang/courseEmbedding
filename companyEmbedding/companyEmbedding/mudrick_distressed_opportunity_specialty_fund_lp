                Says online shopping hurting retailers like Macy’s, Sears
            













Jason Mudrick, founder and chief investment officer at Mudrick Capital Management, discusses the issues plaguing the retail industry, as he sees the potential for 50 retailers to file for bankruptcy this year. He speaks with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker on 'Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas.' (Source: Bloomberg)




Jason Mudrick, whose $1.6 billion Mudrick Capital Management specializes in distressed investments, says he’s betting that the struggle among retailers is here to stay.“This is a forever trend,” Mudrick, whose Mudrick Distressed Opportunity Fund gained 38.7 percent last year, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Monday. “When you think about how things are going to look 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, our parents will be dead, our kids will be adults -- you think more people are going to be shopping online or less? This is the Amazon effect and it’s here forever.”Mudrick is one of a growing number of hedge fund managers who are positioned to profit from a collapse in the sector, which could spur a wave of defaults. Mudrick said he’s targeting securities backed by loans taken by beleaguered mall and shopping center operators who have seen bad news pile up for their anchor chains, including Macy’s Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. He owns credit default swaps on those securities, and said his firm also owned protection against Neiman Marcus Group Inc., which has an active and liquid derivatives market.




While in the past retailers have cited a merchandising problem, now “they’re all saying we need to shrink our footprint,” he said. “I would describe this as a paradigm shift.”J.C. Penney said in February it plans to shutter up to 140 stores, and Mudrick expects the retailer to close a hundred more locations. Macy’s decided last year to shut some 100 outlets, while Sears Holdings Corp. said it will move to close about 150 locations. These decisions will crush C- and D-level malls, said Mudrick.Delinquencies on retail loans have risen to 6.5 percent, a percentage point higher than commercial mortgage-backed securities as a whole, according to Wells Fargo & Co.More from Mudrick on retail and the hedge-fund industry in our TOPLive Q&A

Mudrick also sees opportunities in energy, particularly for companies that are coming out of bankruptcy and may eventually go public. He said he likes Contura Energy Inc., whose shares trade at about $65 over-the-counter because they aren’t registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a steep discount to publicly traded peers. “We suspect Contura will go public at some point this year because the board has to be aware of this discount,” said Mudrick.




The manager said the flow of cash into high-yield assets by mutual funds is a big concern because they promise liquidity to clients that may “evaporate” in times of economic uncertainty. He’s shorting the high-yield index as a cheap hedge on his portfolio, he said in a separate interview on Bloomberg’s TOPLive.Mudrick said he’s positioning his hedge fund to take advantage of dislocations in the credit market that computer-driven trading firms are, for the time being, unable to trade.“We’re fortunate in that computers can’t trade distressed credit, and it’s very difficult to get exposure to the things we invest in through other avenues,” he said. “I believe our style of investing will have a place in allocators’ portfolios for the foreseeable future.”— With assistance by Rachel Evans, and Matt Scully

                Strategies focused on macro trends produced the worst returns
            



                Distressed-debt hedge funds profited from rally in oil prices
            













Who Were 2016's Hedge Fund Winners and Losers?




This was the year to ridicule hedge funds. Pension funds, politicians, Warren Buffett, even hedge fund managers themselves -- they all had something to say about the disappointing performance, high fees and market saturation.Well-known managers from Ray Dalio to John Paulson saw performance on their main funds range from flat to double-digit losses, while some distressed-debt investors like Jason Mudrick benefited from the rally in commodities prices. Strategies focused on macro trends and equity hedges -- which have seen returns crimped by swollen stock-market valuations and ultra-low interest rates -- produced the worst returns.But as the year draws to an end, the industry’s gotten an unexpected pick-me-up. The ripple across markets from the surprise victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump bolstered returns -- reversing the fortunes for some -- and may prove to be a boon going forward. With his policies expected to increase interest rates, produce a wider dispersion in earnings across industries and trigger more merger activity, hedge funds may soon be put back to work.




“The tide has definitely turned,” said Adam Blitz, chief investment officer at Evanston Capital Management, which farms out money to hedge funds. “Since the election I’ve definitely sensed a bit of a change in attitude among folks who are saying, ‘Boy, we don’t know exactly what the future’s going to hold, but it’s unlikely to be more of the same.”’2016’s Double-Digit Winners and LosersThe year saw a wide range of returns, even within the same strategies. Fund NameFirm AUM (billions)  YTD Return (%)StrategyRenaissance Institutional Equities Fund*$32 19.3QuantitativeTwo Sigma Compass Cayman Fund$3810.4QuantitativeOwl Creek Overseas Fund*$2.414.5Event-drivenPershing Square Holdings$11.6-13.5Event-drivenPaulson Advantage$12-16Event-drivenElement Capital Management$915MacroDymon Asia Macro Fund (Singapore)$5.212MacroMudrick Distressed Opportunity Fund$1.535.5DistressedMarathon Special Opportunity Fund$1318.5DistressedCQS Directional Opportunities$1230Multi-strategyBFAM Asian Opportunities Master Fund$216Multi-strategyPine River Liquid Rates Fund*$10.716Relative ValueProxima Capital LP$0.200 44.2Long/Short EquityPassport Global Strategy$3.1-15.2Long/Short EquityHorseman Global Fund$2-17.6Long/Short EquityOdey European$8-48Long/Short EquityOCP Asia’s Orchard Landmark Fund$1.213CreditPaulson Credit Opportunities$1211CreditNote: YTD returns as of Nov. 30. *Indicates through Dec. 9.Macro Funds Disappoint

While hedge funds betting on macroeconomic trends had one of the worst-performing strategies in 2016, the volatility spurred by Trump’s win changed the course for managers such as Brevan Howard Asset Management and Rubicon Fund Management. Brevan Howard’s master fund rallied in November, erasing earlier declines and bringing returns for the year to 2.8 percent, an investor letter shows. Rubicon’s Global Fund surged 21 percent last month, returning it to a profit of 2.2 percent from a loss, a person familiar with the matter said.Some macro funds like Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $721 million Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on exchange rates and gold, benefited this year from bearish bets on the region’s currencies -- especially on the yen weakening against the dollar. That fund gained 22 percent last month and surged 45 percent this year through November.‘Game Changing’




Other marquee macro funds saw deep losses pared. The Pure Alpha II fund, run by Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, was down 10.3 percent at the end of September and has since surged, bringing losses through Nov. 30 to 0.2 percent, two people said.The Trump era could “ignite animal spirits” and attract productive capital, Dalio wrote in a LinkedIn post on Monday. “If this administration can spark a virtuous cycle in which people can make money, the move out of cash (that pays them virtually nothing) to risk-on investments could be huge,” he wrote.Moore Capital Management’s Macro Managers fund trimmed losses for the year to 1.23 percent through Dec. 1, a person said.Moore’s founder, Louis Bacon, said in a Nov. 28 letter to investors that he’s “exceedingly upbeat” for the first time in several years about the “game-changing trading opportunities that lie ahead.” Moore pointed to Trump’s victory and the prospects for higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, booming corporate sector and improving market liquidity.“The recent election in the United States has, in our view, launched nothing short of a sea change in the potential opportunity set for trading markets globally,” Bacon said in the letter.Long-Short Equity Long-short equity hedge funds produced big losers and winners. The strategy returned an average 2 percent in the first 11 months of the year on an asset-weighted basis, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.In Europe the $9.2 billion Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund dropped 18 percent and Crispin Odey’s flagship fund slumped 48 percent. His fund gained more than 20 percent in the two trading days after the U.K.’s June vote to exit the European Union, known as Brexit, but slipped after British stocks rebounded on a weaker pound.“A number of managers were trapped by the selloff and sector rotation at the start of the year, while they failed to capitalize on post-Brexit rally due to lack of risk-taking,” Nicolas Roth, co-head of alternative assets at Geneva-based investment firm Reyl & Cie, said of European hedge funds.In the U.S., Blackstone Group LP’s $1.8 billion Senfina Advisors lost 24 percent this year through November and John Burbank’s Passport Capital saw its Global Strategy fund decline 15.2 percent in the same period.By comparison, New York-based Proxima Capital Management surged 14 percent in November alone, extending gains for the year to 44 percent, while the $1.2 billion Senvest Management surged almost 20 percent over the same period in its master fund, according to people familiar.Distressed-debt hedge funds, mostly concentrated in energy-related bets, profited from the rally in oil prices this year, returning 12 percent on average. Mudrick Capital Management saw some of the biggest gains, soaring 35.5 percent through the end of November. The $13 billion Marathon Asset Management’s Special Opportunity Fund rallied 18.5 percent and the main fund for the $21 billion Canyon Capital Advisors gained 8.3 percent, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, which has $304 million of assets, returned 10 percent through November, boosted by gains in high-yield bonds that recovered with commodities prices, according to chief investment officer George Long.With corporate defaults bound to increase alongside interest rates, distressed-debt hedge funds look to remain strong with a wider range of opportunities arising in the next 12 to 18 months, said Panayiotis Lambropoulos, a money manager at the Employees Retirement System of Texas.Stock Pickers ReturnNext year stock-pickers, who struggled this year to stand out amid an almost all-encompassing equity rally, may also have their time to shine, according to David Saunders, chief executive officer at Franklin Resources Inc.’s hedge fund investor K2 Advisors.With Trump focusing on deregulation and the repatriation of overseas cash, companies may step up stock buybacks, capital expenditures and takeovers, Saunders said. Changes to Obamacare, trade deals and infrastructure spending will impact the health-care, technology, steel and mining industries, he said.“We’ve got some proposals on the table in the Trump administration which present potential opportunity,” Saunders said at a Dec. 7 conference. “The best way to express that is through someone who has an ability to be long and short, go to cash, sit on the sidelines and move nimbly through the market.”Across strategies, the environment will favor smaller, specialized hedge funds over larger, more generalized ones, said Evanston’s Blitz.“It’s all about finding the really good ones who have a real edge in a particular area,” said Blitz. “I still don’t think that, even with that better backdrop, the average hedge fund is going to perform particularly well.”— With assistance by Hema Parmar, Simone Foxman, Saijel Kishan, and Katherine Burton

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.
