Join The Active Winglet Revolution!
Tamarack Active Winglets - The only aerodynamic technology on the market today that can deliver a 20%+ reduction in fuel burn (reducing carbon emissions), a range increase, and fewer takeoff/landing cycles, without any structural reinforcement -  yielding significant time and cost savings. Learn More






Innovation Fueled by Technology
Making a wing more efficient with a winglet comes from more evenly distributing the aerodynamic loading on the wing to reduce drag, but this always introduces more bending load in the wing. In other words, the greater the benefit provided by the winglet design, the more wing bending stress is increased—Until Now How We Do It

Active Winglets, The Shape Of Things To Come






Winglets Work
The initial concept dates back to 1897, when English engineer Frederick Lanchester patented wing end-plates as a method for controlling wingtip vortices.
In 1910, Scottish-born engineer, William Somerville received a US patent for the first functional winglets installed on his biplane and monoplane designs.
In the 1970s NASA engineer Richard Whitcomb, revolutionized wing design with his refinement of the winglet and the ‘split’ winglet . 








A 1910, William Somerville biplane design with winglets.



 The original design for a set of (split) winglets designed by Richard Whitcomb and his team at NASA (circa 1976).







Game-Changer
The efficiencies achieved with winglets comes from more evenly distributing the aerodynamic loading on the wing to reduce drag. But this always introduces more bending load in the wing. Passive Winglets are a compromise, between efficiencies (fuel savings) and additional structure (weight). In other words, the greater the benefit provided by the winglet design, the more wing load is increased, and the more compromises need be made—additional structure and weight, less efficient winglet design, etc.)
That is, until now.






 
Peak Efficiency Without Compromise
Winglets must be designed to ensure that the wing can carry the worst-case flight loads. For example,commercial airliners have winglets that have been de-tuned (or compromised) from an efficiency standpoint in order to reduce the amount of structural reinforcement required to carry the worst case flight loads.  






Active Winglet Benefits



Fuel efficiencies 3 to 4 times greater than traditional winglets
Better high/hot performance
Increase WAT table numbers
Increase in MZFW
Lower operating costs
Much shorter install time
1st and 2nd segment performance increase
Extend the fatigue life of your wings
ATLAS™ Load Alleviation
“Bolt on” installation












The purpose of ATLAS® is to actively reduce the bending load in the wing during conditions that produce worst-case flight loads. This means a Tamarack® winglet can be designed for peak efficiency without compromising for structural considerations.
ATLAS® is the Active Technology Load Alleviation System. A winglet installed with ATLAS® technology is an Active Winglet. Active winglets are designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency—without compromises.
The ATLAS® Active Winglet system is comprised of a wing extension, a built-in load alleviation device (the TACS), and an optimally sized and shaped winglet.

Join The Active Winglet Revolution!
Tamarack Active Winglets - The only aerodynamic technology on the market today that can deliver a 20%+ reduction in fuel burn (reducing carbon emissions), a range increase, and fewer takeoff/landing cycles, without any structural reinforcement -  yielding significant time and cost savings. Learn More






Innovation Fueled by Technology
Making a wing more efficient with a winglet comes from more evenly distributing the aerodynamic loading on the wing to reduce drag, but this always introduces more bending load in the wing. In other words, the greater the benefit provided by the winglet design, the more wing bending stress is increased—Until Now How We Do It

ATLAS Active Winglet FAQ | Tamarak

Winglet FAQs





Active Winglets 101

What does “ATLAS®” stand for?
ATLAS® is the Active Technology Load Alleviation System. A winglet installed with ATLAS® is an Active Winglet.
What does TACS stand for?
TACS is short for Tamarack Active Camber Surfaces.
What is the ATLAS® Active Winglet system?
The ATLAS® Active Winglet system is comprised of a wing extension, a built ­in load alleviation device (the TACS), and an optimally sized and shaped winglet.
What is the “Active” element of ATLAS® Active Winglets?
The active surfaces on the wing extensions that look like little ailerons are called TACS. The TACS move up and down to alleviate certain loads on the wing that otherwise would be addressed by adding extra structure (weight) to the wing. Together, the TACS, extension and winglet compose the ATLAS® Active Winglet system.
What is the big difference between Active Winglets and Passive Winglets?
Passive Winglets require significant structure (weight) to reinforce the wings due to winglet-induced loads during certain flight conditions. Active Winglets are designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency—without compromises that come with additional loads and strengthening structures. Tamarack’s Active Winglets feature innovative load-alleviating technology (ATLAS®) that “dumps the load” when conditions require. This allows for a wing extension and an optimally sized winglet. With the ATLAS® Active Winglet and wing extension, planes save 3 to 4 times more fuel than any passive winglet.
Winglet Benefits
Why do I see so many winglets on so many airliners?
Because winglets work! Fuel is the second largest expense for airlines, so they are always looking for innovative ways to reduce fuel consumption. And as people begin to think more seriously about their carbon footprint, winglets make air travel a more environmentally friendly option. Major airlines wouldn’t install them without realizing a solid ROI.
Do winglets save fuel? How much?
Yes, winglets save fuel. The exact amount saved depends on the type of aircraft, the flight mission, and whether the winglets are passive or active. A typical airliner with Passive Winglets will achieve 3 to 4 percent fuel savings. ATLAS® Active Winglets will provide 3 to 4 times the savings of passive winglets.
Do Active Winglets make planes go faster?
Yes. With the ATLAS® Active Winglets and wing extension system, a plane gets to its ceiling faster, with less drag. Also, an airplane accelerates faster and reaches higher overall speeds than an airplane without winglets at the same power setting.
Do Active Winglets help a plane’s performance?
Winglets allow a airplane to climb faster and achieve cruising altitude sooner. With increased aerodynamics, ATLAS® Active Winglets reduce fuel flow during cruise at the typical power settings. With ATLAS®, all climb gradients are improved, which provides significant increases on high/hot takeoff and landing calculations (WAT tables). Active winglets increase single engine climb performance, and reduce single engine drift-down. High altitude handling qualities are greatly enhanced. In terms of handling, most pilots report that an aircraft with winglets feels more solid in the air than one without. Additionally, there is a MZFW increase.
Do Active Winglets add value to aircraft or make it harder to sell?
According to the Aircraft Bluebook, aircraft with winglets sell before a comparable plane without winglets. Without a doubt, they give a jet an updated look — in addition to enhanced performance.
I heard that winglets only enhance performance for portions of a flight. Is this true?
Winglets provide the most benefit when the coefficient of lift is high, i.e. take offs and climbs, at efficient altitudes. Large portions of every flight can be enhanced with well-designed, right-sized winglets.
Does ATLAS® smooth the ride?
Yes. In fact, commercial airlines use a form of load alleviation to offer a smoother ride and lessen passenger air sickness from turbulence.
How Active Winglets Fly
What kind of plane is best suited for active winglets?
Any aircraft with wings! Any aircraft can be retrofitted with ATLAS® Active Winglets to increase aerodynamic efficiency.
Does ATLAS® tie into other aircraft flight control systems?
No, ATLAS® does not connect or interface with any other flight control system. Complete independence provides increased safety and versatility.
Does the pilot have to do anything to make the system work?
ATLAS® is fully autonomous. The only time the pilot needs to interact with the system is during pre-flight, with a push-to-test button.
Do the TACS move together?
Yes, they deflect symmetrically to relieve wing load when the ATLAS® senses increased loads on the wing.
Can you see the TACS move while you are flying?
Yes, if you can see the wing tip you may see the TACS move, but during a normal flight, movements are very infrequent and incredibly quick.
What if one TACS goes up while the other is down?
Thanks to our advanced engineering, this would be an extremely rare occurrence. If so, the pilot would simply react with aileron input as he or she would if there were a gust that pushed one wing up or down. The condition would be similar to having a hung slat on a jetliner.
How does the pilot know the system is working properly?
If the ATLAS® senses a fault, a red annunciator informs the pilot of the failure. If there is no red light, the system is working properly.
What if the system fails?
The pilot only needs to slow the aircraft to a defined airspeed – just as he or she would in turbulent conditions or if there were other failures, such as a hung slat.
What happens if the system loses power?
A red warning light on the control panel would turn on. This annunciator is powered separately and redundantly, so it would turn on in the event of an ATLAS® power loss. The pilot would then simply slow down.
How reliable is the ATLAS®?
The most critical failure of any system like ATLAS® would be a failure without illumination of the warning light. This type of failure of ATLAS® is calculated at less than 1 failure for every 1 billion flight hours.






“To be honest I was never a fan of winglets installed on any Citation. From my experience they just didn't seem to provide much of an advantage for the expense, but that skepticism changed one morning in September when I flew Tamarack’s 525 [with ATLAS®;  Active Winglets].”

Do Active Winglets Add Value To An Aircraft?
According to the Aircraft Bluebook, aircraft with winglets sell at a premium, and more quickly than  a comparable plane without winglets. Without a doubt, winglets give a jet an updated, modern look in addition to improved performance.










ATLAS® Active Winglets vs Passive Winglets

Greatly increases wing life (fatigue)
3 to 4 times the fuel savings
Greater range
Faster climb to altitude
MZFW increase
Improved High/Hot performance
Lower operating costs
Smoother ride
Easy installation









Cost Savings
With winglets, operators transform the performance of existing aircraft, earning immediate and substantial cost savings with each flight. ATLAS® also offers an increase in fatigue life, a reduction in engine maintenance reserves from de-rated takeoffs, and an increase in payload range. Combined, these equate to a quick return on investment as well as an increase in asset value.


Improved Safety
ATLAS® offers significant safety improvements with lower stall speeds, improved climb rates for clearance over obstacles, glide slope, runway performance and high/hot performance. Increased efficiency also means more fuel reserves at your destination. With the increase in span and dihedral, Tamarack's winglets also increase stability at altitude with reduced Dutch Roll cycles and has eliminated an aircraft yaw damper inop limitation.

A More Sustainable Aviation Industry

Climate change is a challenge facing us all. ATLAS® Active Winglets deliver a significant reduction in CO2 emmissions, as well as a reduction in the use of fossil fuels. With a fast retrofit, the ATLAS® system can be applied to any existing or new aircraft—offering a step change in efficiency and sustainability for the whole aviation industry.






“As a professional pilot, I must say that the Tamarack's winglet-equipped CJ was impressive from takeoff at MTOW to touchdown. The noticeably improved climb performance experienced through the flight levels is a testament to the success and effectiveness of Tamarack’s winglet technology. Fuel consumption to top of climb (TOC) at FL410 was only 560 lbs (82 gallons) and just under 35 minutes”

Active Winglets: FAA Certified Disruptive Technology
3 to 4 Times the Fuel Savings of Passive Winglets






Tamarack Active Winglet System Certified

Tamarack® Aerospace Group, Inc. announces the receipt of an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for its Active Winglet system for the Cessna CJ business jet. Tamarack now has approval for the installation of its Active Winglets on the Cessna CJ, CJ1, CJ1+ & M2 in the US and all of Europe. Tamarack's Active Winglet technology for the CJ and CJ1 provides a fuel saving and range increase of 20%, and fuel savings and range increase for both the CJ1+ and M2.   










How Winglets Work
Aircraft wing efficiency is all about aspect ratio. Longer wings are more efficient for lift and have lower drag—think gliders. Winglets have the effect of increasing span, reduce drag from wing-tip vortices, and improve the lift distribution over the wing.
ATLAS® Active Winglets are designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency without the compromises requisite of Passive Winglets. The key to the ATLAS® Active Winglet system is the load alleviation aspect, which allows for the addition of a wing extension and a highly tuned winglet design while keeping the original wing structure.








Passive Winglets, on the other hand, require additional wing structure and weight to carry the additional wing loads. Tamarack’s innovative load-alleviating technology (ATLAS®) allows Tamarack® to aerodynamically “turn off” the winglet in specific conditions, thus dumping additional loads. Load alleviation enables a substantial increase in aspect ratio without the need for wing reinforcement (and added weight) or other compromises to the winglet design.
With the ATLAS® Active Winglet system; load alleviation, wing extension and winglets achieve 3 to 4 times more fuel savings than Passive Winglets do. The ATLAS® Active Winglet system increases aircraft stability and smooths out the bumps of inflight turbulence. The ATLAS® system will also allow an increase in max zero fuel weight as well as provide better high/hot take off performance.










Certification and Testing
Certification of Tamarack® Aerospace’s Active Winglet technology culminates a three year effort that included more than 400 hours of test flights on its testbed aircraft N86LA, a straight CJ C525-0012, built in 1993. During that time the jet has consistently flown at max takeoff weight to its ceiling limit of FL410 in around 30 minutes or less.
At max continuous thrust, the block fuel burn on these flights averaged an amazing 103 gallons per hour. Tamarack’s ATLAS® equipped CJ set an Unofficial World Record flying 1,853nm non-stop while landing with required fuel reserves, after a 6 hour 16 minute flight with only a 26kt tail wind.
