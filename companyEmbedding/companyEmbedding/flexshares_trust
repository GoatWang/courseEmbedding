Definitions





1Glossary contains definitions of widely used investment terms found on this page.


2SEC Subsidized Yield
The 30-Day SEC Subsidized Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula based on net income earned over the past 30 days. It is a "subsidized" yield, which means it includes contractual expense reimbursements and it would be lower without those reimbursements. It may also include an inflation adjustment that can cause the yield to vary substantially from one month to the next.


3SEC Unsubsidized Yield
The 30-Day SEC Unsubsidized Yield calculation is also computed under the same SEC standardized formula based on net income earned over the past 30 days, but excludes contractual expense reimbursements, resulting in a lower yield. It may also include an inflation adjustment that can cause the yield to vary substantially from one month to the next.


4Distribution YieldThis yield is calculated by taking the most recent distribution annualized and dividing by the fund NAV from the as of date. For Funds that distribute monthly, an NA will be displayed if the fund has not distributed within the last 35 days.


512-Month Dividend Yield
This yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV.

Definitions


Net Asset Value (NAV)NAV is a fund’s price per share, which is calculated by dividing the total value of all the securities in the fund’s portfolio plus cash, interest and receivables less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding.
Market PriceBecause ETFs trade like stocks, ETF shares trade at market value on the secondary market, which can be a dollar value above (trading at a premium) or below (trading at a discount) the fund’s NAV.

FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF) is passively managed and uses a representative sampling strategy to track its underlying index. Use of a representative sampling strategy creates tracking risk where the Fund’s performance could vary substantially from the performance of the underlying index. Additionally, the Fund is at increased dividend risk, as the issuers of the underlying stock might not declare a dividend, or the dividend rate may not remain at current levels. The Fund is also is at increased risk of industry concentration, where it may be more than 25% invested in the assets of a single industry. Finally, the Fund may also be subject to increased volatility risk, where volatility may not equal the target of the underlying index.

The reduction of management fees for certain FlexShares ETFs reflects the ongoing commitment to our value proposition.”FlexShares’ innovative lineup is designed to provide targeted investment outcomes and risk-adjusted returns with funds that address the four fundamental investor objectives of growing assets, managing risks, generating income and providing liquidity. Twenty-three of the 24 FlexShares ETFs focus on alternatively- or factor-weighted index strategies, with an emphasis on providing investment insights and thought leadership. This combination works together to enhance the overall value provided to investors.“Discerning investors are principally concerned with value as opposed to a singular focus on fees,” Thomas said. “Our strategic approach to pricing is largely informed by careful assessment of the needs and preferences of long-term investors.”Details on the select funds with fee reductions effective Tuesday, November 1, 2016, include:                                                                 Current             New                   Maximum         Maximum                   Annual         Annual                   Management         Management       FlexShares ETFs             Ticker             Fee (%)             Fee (%)      FlexShares Morningstar® Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund       GUNR       0.48%       0.46%     FlexShares Morningstar® U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index Fund       TILT       0.27%       0.25%     FlexShares Morningstar® Developed Markets ex-US Factor Tilt Index Fund       TLTD       0.42%       0.39%     FlexShares Morningstar® Emerging Markets Factor Tilt Index Fund       TLTE       0.65%       0.59%     FlexShares Currency Hedged Morningstar® DM ex-US Factor Tilt Index Fund       TLDH       0.47%       0.44%     FlexShares Currency Hedged Morningstar® EM Factor Tilt Index Fund           TLEH           0.70%           0.64%                          ETFs are among the fastest growing product categories in the U.S. asset management industry with 68 new sponsors entering the market over the last 5 years.

Fund returns may not match the return of the respective indexes. The Funds are subject to the following principal risks: asset class; commodity; concentration; counterparty; currency; derivatives; dividend; emerging markets; equity securities; fluctuation of yield; foreign securities; geographic; income; industry concentration; inflation-protected securities; infrastructure-related companies; interest rate / maturity risk; issuer; large cap; management; market; market trading; mid cap stock; MLP; momentum; natural resources; new funds; non-diversification; passive investment; privatization; small cap stock; tracking error; value investing; and volatility risk. A full description of risks is in the prospectus.Read MoreFlexShares iBoxx 3-Year Target Duration TIPS Fund (TDTT) and the FlexShares iBoxx 5-Year Target Duration TIPS Index Fund (TDTF) may invest in derivative instruments. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate with the underlying asset, rate or index and the Funds could lose more than the principal amount invested. The Funds are subject to fluctuation of yield risk, income risk, inflation protected security risk and interest rate/maturity risk. The Funds are non-diversified meaning the Funds’ performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers because the Funds may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers.Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a fixed income security’s price (or principal value) to a change in interest rates. Duration is expressed as a number of years and allows bonds of different maturities and coupon rates to be directly compared. The higher the duration, the greater the magnitude of price change as interest rates change. Modified adjusted duration (MAD) is an estimate of the market duration of a specific TIPS investment. MAD provides a way for investors to compare the interest rate sensitivity of TIPS to other fixed income securities, based on inflation expectations.FlexShares Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index Fund (TILT) is subject to concentration risk. The Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, sector or asset class. The Fund may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, and sector or asset class. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate with the underlying asset, rate or index and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested.FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund (GUNR) is subject to the global natural resource industry. As the demand for or prices of natural resources increase, the Fund's equity investment generally would be expected to also increase. Conversely, declines in demand for or prices of natural resources generally would be expected to cause declines in value of such equity securities. Such declines may occur quickly and without warning and may negatively impact your investment in the Fund.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161025005146/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredMattress Startup Purple Agrees to $1.1B Merger With Publicly-Traded Investment Shell CompanyForbesAnthony Scaramucci’s Hollywood Ties: Investments Include Movie ‘Crazy for the Boys’VarietyWisconsin governor defends $3 billion deal for Foxconn plantReutersZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredThings to know about Foxconn plant coming to WisconsinAssociated PressThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone to punish workers for misconductAssociated PressChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekYahoo FinanceTrunk Club.
