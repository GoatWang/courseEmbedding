WHAT OTHERS SAY ABOUT US




Everyday more people join the ultimate experience.

















Ann




Breast Augmentation Surgery
Evans, GA




Dr Ewart is simply the best doctor! He answered all of my questions and listened to any concerns I had. He absolutely made me feel extremely comfortable and subsided any fears I had. He came highly recommended and I am just so glad that I used him. During my first consultation to his office, he allowed me to try on different implant sizes and showed me a 3D image of what my outcome may look like. I was extremely blown away by all they did. I visited two doctors before him and definitely did not get that kind of treatment. Thank you Dr Ewart for taking such good care of me!













Sara




Breast Augmentation Surgery
Augusta, GA




Dr. Smith and his staff are very friendly and thorough. They entertained all of my questions, and made me feel comfortable and confident. They were also respectful to my wishes and in their suggestions. I plan on returning to Dr. Smith for any future procedures. I know many people who have had breast augmentation with another popular surgeon, and my experience and results are better than any of theirs by far! Best money ever spent!








Karen




Mommy Makeover
North Augusta, SC




I am highly satisfied with the procedure done in this office. The nurse, the doctor and all of their staff were pleasant and helpful. This was a birthday gift from my husband to myself and he's pleased with the results of his investment the work that this doctor performed for me was absolutely amazing.

MASTOPEXY INCISIONS





Cresent Incision
 
Probably the least common incision since very little true lift can be obtained. It does slightly lift the nipple position and implants can be placed through the same location if needed.
 
Periareolar (Donut) incision
 
Hidden along the color change of the areola. Can be a very discreet scar in some patients. It can provide several cm of lifting to the nipple and also reduce the excess skin of the breast with a small scar. Implants can be placed through here as well.
 
Vertical (Lolipop) Incision
 
Probably the most common incision since more lifting can be performed with this incision and more sagging breast skin can be removed. Commonly performed with implant placement for more upper pole fullness.
 
Anchor Incision
 
The most traditional scar that can remove the maximum amount of skin and provide the most lifting if needed. Implants can also be used and placed through the same incisions.
 















IF IMPLANTS ARE NEEDED, DO THEY GO UNDER THE MUSCLE OR ABOVE THE MUSCLE?




Submuscular (below the muscle) Breast Augmentation
 
In 95% of the cases, the breast  implants will be placed in a submuscular position for 2 main reasons:
 

More natural appearance
Less risk of capsular contracture (scarring around the breast implant)

 
 
 
Dual Plane Breast Augmentation
 
This occurs when the implant is placed behind the muscle in the top 2/3 of the implant and behind the gland in the lower 1/3 of the implant. This is performed by surgeons who have experience in this technique in those patients who do not wants the scars from a breast lift but still want implants and they have some mild sagging to the breasts. The dual place creates a lifting and rotation of the breast tissue.
 
 
 
Subglandular (above the muscle) Breast Augmentation
 
This is performed infrequently due to the higher risk of capsular contracture. There are some patients who do benefit from this type of placement:
 

Constricted or tubular breasts (better expansion with this technique)

Sagging of the breasts but not interested in a lift

these patients can have too much sagging
they need to have ticker breast tissue to cover the implant

Recovery Time:

Approx. Cost:
 
$3300 - $5200
 
Payment options




















Eyelid Surgery - Blepharoplasty
 
Eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty, perks up drooping eyelids and minimizes puffy bags below your eyes by removing fat and excess skin and muscle from your upper and lower eyelids. The procedure can make you look younger and more alert; however, it will not lift droopy eyebrows or erase crow’s feet or dark circles under your eyes. To correct droopy eyebrows, you may want to consider a brow lift.
 
Most eyelid surgery patients at Augusta Plastic Surgery are 30 or older, though some have the surgery at a younger age if baggy eyelids are a family trait. If you are physically healthy and emotionally stable, you should be a good candidate.
 
 
What does eyelid surgery involve?
 
The incisions are made in the creases of your upper lids and right below the lashes of your lower lids. The doctor removes excess fat and trims baggy skin and muscle, then closes the incisions.
 
If you need fat but not skin removed from your lower lids, we may recommend a procedure called a transconjunctival blepharoplasty. The doctor makes an incision inside your lower lid and removes the excess fat, leaving no visible scar.
 
Eyelid surgery typically takes one to three hours, though that depends on whether you are having all four lids done or just the upper or lower ones. It is usually performed on an outpatient basis.
 
 
What should I expect after my eyelid surgery?
 
Right after the surgery, your eyes will be lubricated with ointment and possibly bandaged. The lids may feel sore and tight, but your discomfort can be offset with medication.
 
Your stitches will be removed within a week, after which the bruising and swelling will begin to fade. You should be able to watch television or read in two or three days and return to work within a couple weeks. Strenuous activity must wait three weeks.
 
Your scars will look slightly pink for at least six months after the surgery, but eventually they will fade to a nearly invisible white line.

Kybella - Fat Reducing Injections
 
KYBELLA™ is a prescription medicine used to improve the appearance and profile of moderate to severe fat below the chin (submental fat), also called “double chin.”
 
 
How does KYBELLA™ work?
 
The active ingredient in KYBELLA™ is deoxycholic acid, a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat.
 
When injected into the fat beneath your chin, KYBELLA™ causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat.
 
What can I expect during my KYBELLA™ appointment?
 
You willl recieve a custom KYBELLA™ treatment regimen, including how many treatments you need, based on your desired chin profile. Our plastic surgeons will give you a series of injections at each treatment session, which are spaced a month or more apart. Many patients experience visible contouring of their chin profile in two to four treatment sessions spaced at least one month apart. Up to 6 treatments may be administered.
 
How long will the results last?
 
When injected into the fat under your chin, KYBELLA™ causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat. After the aesthetic response is achieved, retreatment with KYBELLA™ is not expected.

 Blog    
 Guest Post ... From a Familiar Face 
 Rachel Harper - Tuesday, October 18, 2016 
  
Those who are long time patients who read this may know me. They may have sat across from me while I gave them their surgical quote or signed them up for
    Brilliant Distinctions. Perhaps we talked on the phone or at length about the procedure of interest. Invariably or in most cases, I would get asked
    the same question, "Is he good?" I took pride in my answer, because I too was a patient before becoming an Augusta Plastic Surgery employee and could
    answer with a resounding "Yes!" And I was not embarrassed to share my experience, because I knew what it was like to consider cosmetic surgery.
 

 

When I look back at my surgery, my goal was to feel like me again. After nursing two children, things were just no longer the same. A family member referred
    me to Dr. Ewart. Everyone there made me feel comfortable, but I struggled with spending that much money on myself, the risk of anesthesia, and my own
    religious beliefs (my body is a temple... a droopier temple than what I wanted). Nervous was an understatement. Knowing what I know now and how pleased
    I am with the outcome, I never would have hesitated.
 

 

Throughout my time at APS there was a common theme amongst our patients for their reasons why they were there even with the most modest of patients, they
    all wanted to feel better about themselves. The desire did not discriminate from male or female, young or old. I've seen a young high school aged guy
    go from shy and embarrassed to walking tall. After one patient received a Juvederm injection, the patient was staring into the mirror crying. She looked
    at me and told me in amazement she no longer looked sad.
 

 

Although the perception of cosmetic or plastic surgery may be related to crude jokes about overworked celebrities, the reality is it is extraordinarily
    common, especially with injectables like Botox and fillers. Patients ranged from young to mature, male and female, married couples, and the like all
    trying to erase the "11s", "their forehead buttcrack," "crows feet," bunny lines, laugh lines, etc. Coming for an injection is easier and quicker than
    a cut and color from a top salon and certainly lasts longer.
 

 

After I left the practice to be a stay at home mom, I committed to a personal goal of becoming fit. This was not just a go to the gym goal. It was a lose
    weight, gain muscle, and while I was doing it go ahead and compete in a fitness competition. I know it was a crazy commitment, but I wanted to see
    how far I could push myself.
 

 

About 7 months later and 30 pounds lighter, I went to visit Augusta Plastic for a little bit of competitive edge. The weight loss had my face looking gaunt
    and tired and I knew a bit of Botox, Juvederm, and Voluma could freshen up my face right before competition. Amazing how a few needle pricks can help
    one's perspective. I felt and looked so much better. My cheeks were full and healthy, the forehead lines were smoothed, and there were fewer lines
    around my mouth. 
 
Happy is an understatement.

 Bikini Competitions Are the New Black  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, December 14, 2015 
 Bikini


 
 
The world of bikini competitions is one many of us only see from the outside, but take one step inside and you can check off your #MotivationMonday         for the week. Meet Lecai Williams, a CRSA woman who went from being an avid gym-goer, an accomplishment in itself for many, to placing 5 th        among competitors at her first bikini competition in Atlanta. She gives us some insight into the world of sparkly costumes, clean eating, and days         of devoted training that she loves so much. 

 
Competitors all have their own goals and purpose for themselves when they decide to compete. For Williams, it was the desire to take it to a different
    level. Already an athlete, she sought to reach an even higher goal. Many women across the country are doing the same. “I really think that a lot of
    moms and women are getting involved because of health risks, says Williams, "heart disease, high blood pressure, all the risk factors with women. Working
    out decreases those factors, so I really think that that it's just wanting to live a healthier lifestyle.”
 

 
 
What does that look like for a bikini competitor? “I had to be disciplined. And I mean mentally and physically; I was very disciplined, recalls Williams.”         She will readily admit to how difficult it was. Eating six small meals and drinking a gallon to a gallon and a half of water each day to stay hydrated,         she completely changed her routine. A routine that already involved life as a busy mother working as both the office manager and secretary of corporation         at  One Smile Away INC. “There were so many different entities that         went into it, not just working out, but my eating habits had to change. I had to do that for at least four months. The last month was the hardest,         because as I got closer to the competition, there was a decrease in carbs. So my energy level went down of course because I didn’t have that fuel.”         

 
Our only question is how? “I had a nutrition plan. You really have to want it. I tell anybody, you really have to want the change, because it’s a lifestyle
    change.” Williams can laugh now, but remembers actually crying when her husband would bring pizza into the house. A struggle we can all relate to.
    “You want it, but you have this goal that you’re working towards and you want to master it.” In addition to the dedicated eating regimen, Williams
    also attributes much of her success to her posing coach Katie, at Be Bella Fitness Boutique    as well as the help of a her online fitness coach, Christina.
 
Carol Johnson, who founded Supernatural Bodybuilding and Fitness (SNBF) with her
    husband in 1996, knows the sacrifices necessary to succeed in these competitions better than most. “I think what keeps us going here and motivates
    us is that people begin to live these healthy lifestyles, eating healthier and exercising,” said Johnson. SNBF works with some competitors from start
    to finish with the competition prep workshops they put on, seeing positive changes first hand. “Confidence shoots to a totally different level, both
    mentally and physically,” said Johnson.
 
Williams would agree, not only did she build muscle, she built her confidence. Something all women desire, and few have actually attained. “If anything
    it boosted my confidence. Just seeing myself in the mirror and looking at my transformation. It’s just been great.” And trust us, Williams exemplifies
    poise. To find something you are truly passionate about is a gift. For that passion to be something that contributes to your health and well being
    is even better. We are all about bettering yourself, for yourself; whatever that looks like for you.
 

 
 
Williams is all set to compete again in the new year with SNBF. Her advice to         those considering their first competition? It’s something every woman needs to hear. “Don’t compare yourself to anyone else. Do this for yourself,         and just stay focused. You have to stay focused and disciplined and don’t let anything deter you. It’s very important, because we all have different         body types, I’m shorter and I’m heavier on the bottom so of course, I’m going to be different, I’m not going to look like the other ones, or I’m         not as thin, don’t compare yourself. Do it for you. Be consistent.”

 October  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, October 26, 2015 
  
Some people think instantly of orange and black: Halloween, or bonfires and fall festivities. Pink is the other color associated with this month. All over
    the football fields from high schools to the NFL, many are wearing their pink to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month. University Hospital is proudly
    displaying its pink banner across the front of the building. We are nearing the end of the month, and the initial excitement over the new pops of pink
    all over the place has probably begun to fade. Looking beyond the ribbons, Nike socks, and football cleats, are the people they represent. For a plastic
    surgeon, the realities of breast cancer can be close. It’s a special gift to be able to give someone back what they once had, but lost. Because of
    the extent of not only the surgeries, but also the number of follow up appointments, our physicians typically get to know these patients better than
    any others. While it might be a difficult job, rewarding is how Dr. Ewart describes it.
 
“Breast Cancer patients are typically overwhelmed, anxious and worried when I first meet with them because of the new found circumstances they are now
    in. Everything is new to them and they don’t know what to expect. The initial consultation is typically longer than most consults because of the variety
    of options to reconstruct the breast. The options available also are very dependent of the type of cancer. Will they need radiation or chemotherapy,
    do they want to remove just one or both breasts, their current breast size, their desired breast size, and the amount of extra abdominal fat they have.
    An important part of this process is education and also support groups from other patients who have been through the same thing.” Our job then is to
    guide them through it all. 
 
It might surprise you to know that most breast cancer patients don’t actually have reconstructive surgery. At least not right away. Some need time to think
    on it, or may just be weary of recurring cancer. The most common method of reconstruction is the tissue expander, which is achieved through saline
    injections. It takes two to three months to expand the skin and underlying muscle. Once this is done, a permanent prosthesis can be placed. After one
    month, they can begin reconstruction of the nipple, and two weeks from that point they can begin the tattoo process to try to make the color as it
    was before. “Satisfaction is high, says Dr. Smith, even when the reconstruction isn’t done right away, it gives patients hope knowing it can
    be done.”
 
To our breast cancer patients: we admire your strength and are proud to be on this journey with you.

 ​What Is The One Product That Will Solve All My Problems? 
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Tuesday, October 13, 2015 
 
It can't fix everything, but its skincare powers are impressive.
 
We ask this question everywhere, but likely most often when we are starring at a vast array of skin care products with a look of exasperation in our eyes.
    We all know that following a skin care regimen will help to get us the best results, but is there one thing that might help get us on the
    right track? The answer may just be a derivative of Vitamin A.
     
 

 
 
Listed as one of the top 6 antiaging breakthroughs    by WebMD, retinols are extremely effective in reducing fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots. One study showed: after 52 weeks, retinol had improved crow's feet fine lines by 44%, and mottled pigmentation by 84%, with over 50% of subjects showing +2 grades of improvement in many parameters. Additionally, at week 52, histochemical data confirmed the clinical results, showing increased expression of type I procollagen, hyaluronan, and Ki67 as compared to vehicle. 
 
In other words, the anti-aging properties are real. 
 
These days, it seems that regardless of your age, you were supposed to start using anti-aging products yesterday. The issue with that for many 20 and 30
    somethings is that many are still trying to get their acne under control. They then face the dilemma. Anti-aging products and acne, or clear skin and
    falling behind on the proactive wrinkle prevention bandwagon. When it comes to our faces, we don’t ever want to compromise. We don’t want to deal with
    acne or wrinkles. Retinol can help both. 
 
How does it work? 
 
Retinol works by aiding in cell turnover.
    It helps to get rid of dead skin cells and promote the growth of new ones. This creates that glowing look everyone is after and wipes away all of the
    dullness. Getting rid of dead skin cells means less clogged pores, one of the biggest causes of acne. Collagen production is boosted as well, thickening
    the skin. Like it or not, retinol use gives you just one more very compelling reason to use a sunscreen daily. We all know we shouldn’t leave the house
    without it, but for many, when they can’t see the damage being done, it can be hard to be diligent. Think of it like this. This product is shown to  reduce photodamage, so why allow any more? 
 
Many people experience peeling and dryness at first, but this only means the retinol is doing the job. When these side effects do show up, all it takes
    is a few days of backing off to see these dwindle. Don’t let the potential of dry skin scare you away, your face will tell you when to slow down and
    when it has become used to the product. Begin with a lower strength and work your way up. Trust us, we think it will be worth the wait.

 Why Everyone Will Be Talking About Chins This Year  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, September 28, 2015 
  
Because the game has changed. Let’s face it. You’re not going to the gym to hammer out your double chin-fighting exercises. And that’s okay. The FDA has recently approved an injection to dissolve submental fullness, aka your
    double chin. Yes, you read that right. Expected to be just as big as Botox, the new drug by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Kybella, is the first of its
    kind and is hitting select facilities this fall. Augusta Plastic Surgery is one of them.
 

 
 
Kybella is made up of deoxycholic acid, which
    our bodies actually naturally produce to absorb and break down fat. This artificial version is injected right underneath the chin. Much like the results
    of CoolSculpting, the fat cells are killed and excreted through the body. Kybella is different than its other injectable counterparts, in that once
    the results are evident, there is not a need to continue treatments because the fat cells eliminated can no longer store fat. Most patients will require
    between two and four treatments spaced one month apart and only lasting about 15 minutes each. Up to six treatments can be given. So what kind of research
    is out there? Quite a bit. Check out these stats released by Kythera:
 
Kybella is supported by a global clinical development program that includes over 20 clinical studies with more than 2,600 patients worldwide, of which over 1,600 have been treated with Kybella. In the pivotal Phase III studies, 68.2 percent of patients responded to Kybella based on a composite of validated physician and patient measurements. Patients treated with Kybella reported an improvement in the amount of fat in the area under the chin. Patients also reported improvement in the emotional impact of submental fat when asked how happy, bothered, self-conscious, embarrassed, old and overweight they felt following treatment in relation to the amount of their submental fat.   

  
 
 
Sign us up. In a 2014 survey administered by the American Society
        for Dermatologic Surgery, 68% of respondents reported dissatisfaction with excess fat under the chin. This common dissatisfaction is not limited
        by a greater age or weight, but can be a result of        genetics. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle should always be a staple, but some areas can be hard to address. The Cara Delevingne
        chiseled jawline is in reach. We know it’s brand new, but it’s worth noting that Kybella has already received a 100% worth it rating
        on realself.com. 
 
A report from one of our staff members who volunteered to be the first to try our newest procedure: 
 
Initial thoughts: Painless. She did not feel much aside from the first numbing shot administered. The area was a bit red and
        swollen.
 
1 Day Post Procedure: The area injected felt a bit hard, there were just a few faint bruise marks.
 
2 Weeks Out: The area has now softened and there is no sign of injection bruising visible. 
 
We will keep you posted with results!

 Nervous? Don't be.  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, September 21, 2015 
   
 
 
    A trip to the doctor’s office means something different for everyone. For some, there are no reservations. For others, the thought sends shivers. Throw
    in the idea of surgery or needles? It’s over. Perhaps connotations are based upon previous experiences, horror stories, or scenarios we build up in
    our minds. Face your fears with these tips.
 
Bring your iPod. One study    looked at 73 randomized controlled trials, finding that listening to music reduced not only anxiety, but also postoperative pain and the use of painkillers.
    It was also shown that the music selection did not alter these results. So go ahead with your guilty pleasure 80’s ballads, it doesn’t have to be Bach.
    
 

 
 
Ditch the Starbucks for the day. Caffeine can induce anxiety. Grab your to-go mug and fill it with hot tea. Meet L-theanine.
    Research shows that the L-theanine found in green tea leaves can reduce anxiety and lower blood pressure. If you’re missing your venti caramel
        macchiato, try adding some milk to your tea to doctor it up a bit.
 
Do some research. Read reviews. But do this within reason. Sometimes doing so can psych you out even more than necessary. We’ve all done the WebMD
    search for a minor symptom we had and come to the outrageously quick conclusion that we are in fact dying. What you can and should do, however, is
    read up on your physician. Realself.com is an excellent resource with a list
    of reviews a mile long. Knowing others have had a positive and rewarding experience can make all the difference. 
 
Get moral support. Bring a friend. At the very least, they can make you laugh. If they’re a good friend, they’ll
    tell it to you straight. Letting you know which fears may be irrational. 
 
Communicate. Let your doctor know your nerves are on a level comparable to how you’d envision them being if you were about to dive into a shark
    tank. He or she will no doubt have some famous words of wisdom they tend to give out. 

Remember why you are doing this. From Botox to breast reductions, whatever the procedure, at the end of the day, it’s for you.

 6 Reasons CoolSculpting Might Be for You  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, September 14, 2015 
 

Maybe you should consider CoolSculpting after reading this.
             



 
1.You passed out at the school blood drive because nothing scares you more than the thought of a needle. Deep breaths. There are no needles involved
        here. CoolSculpting is completely noninvasive.In fact, it’s the only other FDA approved way to get permanent fat removal other than through liposuction
        or surgical procedures.


 
2.You are so busy you should have a personal assistant to manage your life. There is no downtime with CoolSculpting. It truly is unparalleled. You
        can get back to your life right away. Oh, and did we mention we have 2 CoolSculpting machines? We can treat 2 areas at once, cutting the treatment
        time in half. Save those vacation days for a trip to the beach. 
 
3.You have to see it to believe it. There are countless before and after pictures        to browse. The results speak for themselves. Check out this study        published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. Here are some we’ve seen for ourselves.

 


 

 
 
 

 


4.You like to fly under the radar. Many people don’t want anyone to know they’ve had anything done. They just want results. There will be no telling
        scars, but you may just decide to tell everybody. This study        found that 82% of the patients treated would recommend the procedure to a friend. 
 
         
5.You’re tired of painting on those abs every morning. Just kidding. But there is a better way. You’re there front and center for every new class at
        the gym, but that stomach has looked the same for years and you’re tired of the muffin top. Think of it as a fresh start. You’ll continue to exercise
        just like before but that stubborn pooch is now gone. And it really is gone. The fat cells treated are excreted from the body. Put down the iPad
        and the ever popular contouring tutorials. 
 
  

 

 
6.You love the return of fall because it means big sweaters and riding boots, but then you remember what goes in between the two. Skinny jeans. Cue
        the dreaded dance required to get them up our legs. The fat cell itself does not weigh much, so you won’t necessarily notice dramatic weight loss
        from your CoolSculpting treatment, but you will see inches lost. Which we all know is the key to squeezing into the jeans you haven’t seen since
        last September.

 Should You Find A Plastic Surgeon with 3D Imaging for Breast Augmentation? 
 Christopher Ewart - Friday, November 08, 2013 
 A most enthusiastic....YES.

First off, what is 3D imaging? The Vectra XT takes 6 instant images and creates a 3D replica of your chest on a large video screen. We can then rotate
        the image and show what any size implant would look like on your chest.
Why would I need this? You can get a realistic view of what the results will look like and can pick the right size the very first time. No more...."I
        wish I picked a larger size."
How accurate is it? A recent study places the accuracy at about 90% which is what we have been seeing here at Augusta Plastic Surgery.
Other reasons?
        
More planning and discussion can be done about any asymmetry and if different sizes are needed, we can address those before surgery
View the potential results from the front, side, angles, bird's eye view
Look at different profiles to see about creating more cleavage


 So lets see an example This is a young lady who wanted to go from a 34 A cup to a full C cup.


We discussed using silicone implants placed behind the muscle to create the most natural feel and look with her body type. I showed her some images with
350-400 cc implants which would give her a full C and she felt that might not be large enough. This is a 421 cc Midprofile Silicone Implant using the 3D
imaging. She felt this was more of the size she wanted which would put her closer to a small D in some bras. Here are her before, 3D and after images side
by side.



 
    


 If you are considering having this surgery, get the 3D imaging first. Augusta Plastic Surgery Breast Augmentation with 3D Imaging Dr. Christopher J.

 Moderate versus Moderate Plus versus High Profile Implants 
 Christopher Ewart - Sunday, October 17, 2010 
 Disclaimer: Let your plastic surgeon help you decide which implant shape and projection is the best for your body. If you are the patient who has gone
the extra mile and researched every possible option involved in breast augmentation, then this webpage is for you. You either want to know why your surgeon
has chosen a certain profile implant for you or you want to make that decision yourself. Well here is what you need to know plain and simple as possible.
There are basically three implant profiles and 2 types of material (silicone gel and saline)

moderate (flat and wide)
moderate plus (in-between)
high profile (narrow and more projecting)
    


 Notice above: The saline implants are much taller and more projecting than the silicone implants. If all of these are 300 cc implants then the high
profile silicone will have the same projection as the moderate plus saline. You may want to reread that last sentence to completely understand. Look at
this photo: (All patients in their 20s who are approximately 5'5", 120 lb. and go from an A cup to a C cup with 350-375 cc implants)  

   This photo shows why I lean toward placement of Moderate Plus Saline and High Profile Silicone implants if possible. Too flat sometimes with the
moderate silicone and too much projection sometimes with the high salines. But remember...not always. You can actually get great results with every type
of implant when placed in the right patient. Your body shape, measurements, current and desired cup sizes, and skin quality all come in to play when determining
which implants are best for you. At Augusta Plastic Surgery, we listen to what you want and can help you choose the right implant for you.

3D IMAGING INCLUDED WITH YOUR CONSULT









Interested in 3D imaging for your rhinoplasty?
 
We can provide projected images of how a rhinoplasty can change your appearance with our Vectra 3D. In the Vectra illustration the images shown below are the pre-op profile, rhinoplasty, and then rhinoplasty combined with chin augmentation.











Nose Surgery
 
Also known as rhinoplasty, nose reshaping or nose job
 
When to Consider Nose Surgery
 

If you are unhappy with the shape, size or angle of your nose
If your nose is too large, too small or not in proportion to the rest of your face
If you have breathing problems resulting from irregularities inside your nose
If you have a nasal hump or a nasal tip that is drooping, too elevated or wide

 
Related Procedures:
 
Many people who consider a rhinoplasty also consider chin augmentation, brow lift or eyelid surgery.
 
 
Am I a good candidate for nose surgery?
 
The following are some common reasons why you may want to consider rhinoplasty:
 

Your nose is too large or too small
Your nose does not seem to fit with the rest of your face
Your nose is crooked, badly shaped, or out of alignment
You have nasal blockage inside your nose and have trouble breathing
You have a birth defect that you would like improved
You would like improvement, not perfection, in the appearance of your nose
 

If you are in good general health, have a positive attitude and realistic expectations, you are most likely a good candidate for this procedure.
 
How is a nose surgery procedure performed?
 
After numbing the area, your surgeon will make incisions to access the bones and cartilage that support the nose. There are two general techniques for making the incisions: open and endonasal.
 
By adding or removing bone and cartilage and adjusting the supporting structures inside the nose, the size of your nose can be reduced or increased and the nose may be shortened or lengthened.
 

Tip grafts made of cartilage can be used to remodel the tip of your nose, making it more uplifted, longer, shorter, or thinner.
Your skin and other soft tissues will remodel to assume the shape of the underlying structure.
In some patients, tissue fillers or fat grafts can be added to increase volume in desired areas.

 
What are my options?
 
There are two main incision approaches: the open approach and the internal (endonasal) approach.
 
In addition to incision options, there are various methods for augmenting your nose or smoothing surface deformities.
 

Autologous cartilage grafts taken from your nasal septum (the wall inside the nose that divides one air passage from the other) offers the best chance for a natural result. If cartilage and bone have already been removed from the nasal septum, then ear or rib cartilage and sometimes bone from the skull are other options.
Although solid silicone implants are available for nasal surgery, these are foreign materials that may become infected or react poorly with your nasal tissues and have to be removed. That is why natural cartilage, if a supply is available, is the most trouble-free option.
Fillers or fat grafts may also be injected to smooth the nose, to camouflage deformities or indentations, or to add volume in desired areas

 
How do I prepare for a nose surgery procedure?
 
Your surgeon will provide thorough preoperative instructions, answer any questions you may have, take a detailed medical history, and perform a physical exam to determine your fitness for surgery.
 
In advance of your procedure, your surgeon will ask you to:
 

Stop smoking at least six weeks before undergoing surgery to promote better healing
Avoid taking aspirin, certain anti-inflammatory drugs, and some herbal medications that can cause increased bleeding
Regardless of the type of surgery to be performed, hydration is very important before and after surgery for safe recovery.

 
Rhinoplasty is usually performed on an outpatient basis. Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and to stay with you at least the first night following surgery. If your surgery involves septal work or is a revision of prior work, it may require an overnight stay.
 
What can I expect on the day of rhinoplasty surgery?
 
Your rhinoplasty will be performed in our AAAA Certified Outpatient Ambulatory Surgery Center. Most rhinoplasty procedures take at least one to four hours to complete but may take longer.
 

Medications are administered for your comfort during the surgical procedure.
General anesthesia is commonly used during rhinoplasty, although local anesthesia or intravenous sedation may be desirable in some instances.
For your safety during the surgery, various monitors will be used to check your heart, blood pressure, pulse and the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood.
Your surgeon will follow the surgical plan discussed with you before your operation.
After your procedure is completed, you will be taken into a recovery area where you will continue to be closely monitored. You will have a splint placed outside your nose to support its new shape as it heals. Nasal packing may also be used inside the nose to provide additional support.
 

You will probably be permitted to go home after a short observation period unless you and your plastic surgeon have made other plans for your immediate postoperative recovery.
 
Aftercare And Recovery
 
Your surgeon will discuss how long it will be before you can return to your normal level of activity and work. After surgery, you and your caregiver will receive detailed instructions about your postoperative care, including information about:
 
Normal symptoms you will experience
Potential signs of complication.
 
Immediately after rhinoplasty
After surgery you may be asked to wear a nasal splint over your nose for support. The splint will protect your nose while you sleep and shield it from accidental bumps. You may also have a small triangular bandage beneath the tip of your nose. Nasal packing will be placed inside your nose for additional support; it acts as an internal splint to hold everything in place and to keep the airway clean and free of crusts. Expect some swelling and bruising and possibly some discomfort. Your face will be puffy, and the areas around your nose and eyes will be bruised and swollen after surgery. We may recommend cold compresses to help minimize the swelling and reduce pain. You may need to keep your head elevated and relatively still for the first few days after surgery. We will prescribe a pain medication to deal with any pain you may experience. You will have to limit your activities for a few days to weeks.
 
Recovery time frame after rhinoplasty
It is vitally important that you follow all patient care instructions provided to you. We will also provide detailed instructions about the normal symptoms you will experience and any potential signs of complications. It is important to realize that the amount of time it takes for recovery varies greatly among individuals. You will need to wait for several weeks before you can engage in exercise or athletics.
 
The first two weeks
All surgical packing within your nose will be removed within four to seven days after surgery. The splint and bandages on your nose will be removed in a week to ten days. It takes about ten to fourteen days before most of the swelling and bruising improves. Your return to work or school depends on how much exertion your job or your school activities require. Most normal activities including exercise can usually be resumed within three weeks. You should avoid strenuous exercise, straining, bending, and lifting until cleared to do so by your plastic surgeon.
 
After the first two weeks
Minor swelling of your nose may persist for up to a year but most likely will not be noticeable to others. It will be a few months before you can expose your reshaped nose to direct sunlight, and it may be a number of weeks before you can wear glasses without special support, such as tape, if the bones in your nose were altered.

 October  
 Madeleine Giovannelli - Monday, October 26, 2015 
  
Some people think instantly of orange and black: Halloween, or bonfires and fall festivities. Pink is the other color associated with this month. All over
    the football fields from high schools to the NFL, many are wearing their pink to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month. University Hospital is proudly
    displaying its pink banner across the front of the building. We are nearing the end of the month, and the initial excitement over the new pops of pink
    all over the place has probably begun to fade. Looking beyond the ribbons, Nike socks, and football cleats, are the people they represent. For a plastic
    surgeon, the realities of breast cancer can be close. It’s a special gift to be able to give someone back what they once had, but lost. Because of
    the extent of not only the surgeries, but also the number of follow up appointments, our physicians typically get to know these patients better than
    any others. While it might be a difficult job, rewarding is how Dr. Ewart describes it.
 
“Breast Cancer patients are typically overwhelmed, anxious and worried when I first meet with them because of the new found circumstances they are now
    in. Everything is new to them and they don’t know what to expect. The initial consultation is typically longer than most consults because of the variety
    of options to reconstruct the breast. The options available also are very dependent of the type of cancer. Will they need radiation or chemotherapy,
    do they want to remove just one or both breasts, their current breast size, their desired breast size, and the amount of extra abdominal fat they have.
    An important part of this process is education and also support groups from other patients who have been through the same thing.” Our job then is to
    guide them through it all. 
 
It might surprise you to know that most breast cancer patients don’t actually have reconstructive surgery. At least not right away. Some need time to think
    on it, or may just be weary of recurring cancer. The most common method of reconstruction is the tissue expander, which is achieved through saline
    injections. It takes two to three months to expand the skin and underlying muscle. Once this is done, a permanent prosthesis can be placed. After one
    month, they can begin reconstruction of the nipple, and two weeks from that point they can begin the tattoo process to try to make the color as it
    was before. “Satisfaction is high, says Dr. Smith, even when the reconstruction isn’t done right away, it gives patients hope knowing it can
    be done.”
 
To our breast cancer patients: we admire your strength and are proud to be on this journey with you.

  * In Memory *
  John Randolph "Randy" Smith(aka Randolph J. Smith)1917-1987
"He loved to con, 
but never cheated a soul"



Randy with Soapy's roulette table






John
Randolph Smith, aka, Randolph John Smith, prefered to be called Randy, and will be addressed from
this point on as such.  He was the grandson of Jefferson (Soapy)
Smith and Jeff Smith's father.  
Born August 24, 1918 in St. Louis, Missouri, Randy had two brothers and six sisters. At age 14 his mother Ethal passed away and Randy
was raised for a time by his grandmother, Mary Smith (Soapy's
widow). Randy's father and grandmother educated the grandchildren about their criminal grandfather. Mostly they were told of the good side Soapy had to him. Because of those stories young Randy
developed a love for magic and gambling. He never became
addicted, as he knew all to well that it was a losing battle. Randy's
father taught him the shell game and three-card monte, the staples of
the short con. In later years he taught his sons, greg and Jeff, how to do the
swindles. The methods were very basic, but they were good enough to fool most people.



Pencil by Randy Smith (1936-1940)

In 1936, at age 19, Randy
joined the submarine fleet of the U.S. Navy and was
stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. He left the Navy in 1940,
missing the 1941 attack and world war two. Once out of the military Randy moved to Los
Angeles, California where he was soon joined by his father. At
his father's passing in 1952, Randy inherited a portion of the Soapy Smith collection of the
letters and documents. Everything had been saved all these years and were being passed down to the
next generation of Smith's. Randy married Nina Pickett and had one daughter, Randi Jean Smith. Randy later married
Dorthy ("Dotti") and had two children, Greg and Jeff (this website's
author). Randotti Products (coming from the first names of Randy and Dotti Smith) was a family owned business that had its roots as a hobby for the daughter of Randy and the children of his wife Dotti. With the birth of a son and another on the way Randy moved his family to Anaheim, California where the supplemental income hobby turned to Disneyland as a customer in 1956. The orders increased so much that Randy quit his job as an engineer and went into business for himself. During this time the company was known only as "rj," the small case initials of Randy J. Smith. The name of Randotti was formed in 1967-68.  Randotti Products Randy built a back building in their backyard and began pumping out about 175 different types of souvenir skulls, tikis, tombstones and statuary. Many glowed in the dark. At the request of buyers at Disneyland Randy began to design products specific to certain rides in the magic kingdom such as the Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted Mansion. Soon numerous Disneyland shops carried the Randotti line, which were often displayed in the street windows, the most prestigious location possible for a souvenir. Orders kept increasing until Randy and Dotti moved their backyard business into shop in Stanton, California in 1967. When Walt Disney World opened in 1971 the buyers there screamed for Randotti merchandise as well.Today, the Randotti name and their line of souvenir skulls and tombstones has a collector following and the items sell for many times their original price. The Smith family is proud and we know Randy and Dotti would be as well, knowing that their work still brings joy to so many. The backyard saloonWhen the family business was moved to Stanton Randy turned the backyard building in Anaheim into a private old west saloon and gambling hall, to honor his grandfather, Soapy Smith. It was a grand place to grow up in as a kid. Collecting and selling antique gambling equipment became a sideline for the family. For
thirty years son Jeff learned as much as he could about Soapy from his
father. Randy passed away on December 12, 1987. His marker bears dice, coming up sevens on every angle. He is greatly missed.

Description

    "The writing style of the book is great. It is definitely non intimidating for students. The authors do a great job in the clarity and readability of the material." - Judy Correa Kaiser, Saint Ambrose University " It makes research design and statistics approachable and students are able to grasp the material well." - Deborah Ragin, Montclair State University " The writing style is enjoyable. The writers write like they are talking to a student. It is approachable and easy to understand. I have not seen this in other experimental psychology textbooks." - Rebecca Regeth, California University of Pennsylvania "I love the writing style of this text. The subject level, the clarity of the arguments, the readability and interest is very appropriate the new investigators that this class prepares. The chapter organization presents a natural flow and development of the subject matter based on progression and relevance," - Own Johnson, Tennessee State University

Keith has worked extensively in the theater and his Broadway credits include Fences, Come Back, Little Sheba, King Hedley II, The Piano Lesson, and Salome.
Off-Broadway credits include Fabulation (Playwrights Horizons), Jitney (Second Stage), Holiday Heart (Manhattan Theatre Club), Before It Hits Home (NYSF) and Auturo Ui (Classic Stage Company). Regionally, he has acted in God of Carnage (Atlanta's Alliance Theatre), The Dreams of Sarah Breedlove (Alabama Shakespeare), In Walks Ed (Long Wharf), Les Trois Dumas (Indiana Rep), Tartuffe (Hartford Stage), and The Heliotrope Bouquet (La Jolla Playhouse), among many others.
In 2001, Keith starred in the international tour of the August Wilson play Jitney, which opened at the National Theatre in London where it was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best New Play.
Keith is the voice of Clay Simons, The Lost's Road Captain, in the hugely popular video game Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned and as The Crowd of Liberty City and The Vibe 98.8 Imaging, in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV. Smith reprised his role as Clay in Grand Theft Auto V.
In 2012, Keith performed in the Virginia Stage Company (VSC) production of the August Wilson drama Fences which originally starred James Earl Jones on the Great White Way. In reviewing Keith's performance, here's what Mal Vincent of The Virginian-Pilot newspaper had to say: "Smith is better than James Earl Jones was in originating the role on Broadway in 1987."
