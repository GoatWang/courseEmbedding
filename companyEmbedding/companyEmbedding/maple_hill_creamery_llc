                                    Spicy-sweet and reminiscent of apple pie.

                                    Zingy, tart, and authentic, the yogurt eater's yogurt.                                






                                    Lemon                                

                                    Just a tad of real lemon extract. Fresh, citrusy, and bright.                                






                                    Vanilla

                                    Think orange-créme soda, without all the sugar.

                                    The best berries, not 'natural flavor' for a subtly sweet treat.

Company Summary


We make our yogurt a little differently. A little more simply.

We rely on a very local supply of milk from 100% grass-fed certified organic small farms near Stuyvesant, NY. We don't homogenize, strain, or skim the milk, and use only scant amounts of authentic extracts, fruit puree, organic sugar, and real maple syrup. We favor a slower, gentler 12-hour culturing process, and donâ€™t add any thickeners, colors, or preservatives. Ever.
The result? A traditionally tart, full-fat, barely-sweet cup of smooth European-style yogurt with a luxurious â€œcreamlineâ€? layer to savor
