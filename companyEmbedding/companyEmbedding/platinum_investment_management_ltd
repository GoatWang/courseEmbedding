So what should Australian investors do, particularly when the property boom is beginning to subside? Where do the better opportunities lie?

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP)
23 May 2007
Platinum Asset Management Limited (ASX code PTM) has a DRP in place but it is not activated and is non-operational.
Given the limited capital requirements of a financial services organisation, such as PTM, it is currently unlikely that the Board of Directors will ever activate the DRP.

        Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
    


Building a Sustainable Business
2014 was a milestone year – Platinum celebrated its 20th anniversary and its funds under management (FUM)1 exceeded A$25 billion.
From a starting-point of a team of four investment professionals and a handful of support staff, Platinum has built a strong brand name and a reputation that is the envy of the financial services industry.  This reputation has been achieved by staying true to Platinum’s key objective – delivering superior returns over time and communicating the intricacies of global investing (and providing investors with steady long-term performance.)
The business of Platinum is to manage clients’ money.  It charges clients a fee for doing so, and these fees are Platinum’s chief source of revenue.  We, at Platinum, have a simple core belief:  if Platinum responsibly and successfully looks after investors’ money, its business should prosper.  A failure to understand and commit to this priority will not result in an enduring wealth management business; marketing, commissions and other devices notwithstanding.

Being a Responsible Money Manager
History of Strong Performance
Our history has been punctuated with recurrent market challenges – the Asian monetary crisis of 1997-98, the tech bubble of 2000-01, and the more recent global financial crisis of 2007-08.  In spite of these challenges, we have seized the many opportunities presented by the market and have over the long-term typically outperformed the benchmark MSCI Index by a significant margin.  As at 31 May 2016, the flagship Platinum International Fund had achieved an average compound annual return of 12.65% since its inception in 1995, compared to 6.28% for the MSCI All Country World Net Index.  Indeed, the majority of our Platinum Trust Funds have performed strongly over the long-term, delivering superior returns to our investors.
Click here for more information on the performance of all publicly available Platinum funds.
Investment Process
How did we achieve these strong returns?  Platinum is well-known for its distinctive stock selection methodology which seeks out a broad range of investments where the market has, for transient reasons, mispriced their business.  To do this, Platinum employs a team of highly skilled specialist analysts, who take a global perspective and apply screening and intensive research to isolate real as opposed to imagined issues.
In applying Platinum’s thematic, contrarian investment method, we build each portfolio from individual stock selections rather than from any pre-determined asset allocation. At times whole sectors or industries may be misunderstood and this can give rise to several investments in that and related areas. We pay no heed to the weightings of any benchmark, such as the MSCI Index.  
Investment risks are actively monitored and managed through appropriate measures such as the use of derivatives and currency hedging (where permitted under the fund’s mandate).
A more detailed description of our investment process can be found here and click here for further information on Platinum’s risk management strategies.
Better Engagement with Investors
In addition to the core principle of striving for superior long-term performance in global equity investments, Platinum’s business has been founded on the following precepts:

No up-front fees;
No exit fees;
No trailing commissions to financial intermediaries or advisers;
No soft dollar benefits paid to or received from financial advisers or advisory firms;
Forward pricing (no “market timing” or “late trading”) of unit trust products;
We support financial advisers with quality presentations from the investment team;
We give biennial investor presentations for those investing directly with us;
We provide clear and engaging quarterly investor reports;
We provide consistent high service standards to clients and advisers.

All of these principles were adopted with the single aim of better servicing our clients, and none of which has altered over the 22 years of Platinum’s growth.
Ethical Conduct
The ethical standards of the financial services industry have been facing increasing scrutiny worldwide since the global financial crisis.  Platinum has always held the highest standards of integrity and honesty and has put in place robust policies aiming to prevent unethical conduct such as fraud, bribery and insider trading.  Given the nature of Platinum’s business, we are particularly mindful of the risks of insider trading and personal dealing.  Platinum has therefore implemented appropriate systems of ongoing monitoring and regular training to ensure compliance by all staff members with our Business Rules of Conduct and Trading Policy.
Ethical Investment
Platinum regards the subject of ethical investing as highly complex and points to the contradictions and conflicts that are an essential element of the capitalist system.  We have no way of individually assessing the beliefs and values of our investors or the companies in which we invest.
Cognisant of the diversity of views on these subjects, Platinum decided at this stage not to adopt any formalised ethical investment policy in selecting, retaining and realising investments.  However, that is not to say that ethical considerations such as environmental responsibility and labour standards do not play a part in our investment process.  Our investment analysts routinely take such factors into consideration when assessing the overall quality and sustainability of an investment prospect. (It has been our experience that when our values of fair play and ethics are upheld by the company under scrutiny, it tends to lead to fewer disappointments as an investment.) 
To adopt a more formal set of ethical investment criteria would require Platinum to develop a template of ethical values that (hopefully) satisfies the majority of unit holders on matters including labour standards, environmental impact, social intercourse, political system, governance behaviour and standards, national institutions and so on.  In our view, it is not possible to create such a template without unduly imposing a set of values on all investors regardless of whether they share these values.
Workplace Diversity and Flexibility
In a service-oriented business like Platinum, our people are our greatest asset.  That is why we focus equally on attracting the best talent and providing an inclusive and supportive work environment for our staff.
Platinum actively promotes a culture of equal opportunity and has the principles of meritocracy, fairness, equality and contribution to commercial success at all levels within the Company.  We value the blend of skills, perspectives, styles and attitudes available to the Company through a diverse workforce and recognise that such diversity has contributed to our business success.  (For example, our investment research team includes not only economists and finance experts, but also scientists and engineers.  You can find more information about our investment team here.)
In this context, workplace diversity includes gender, age, ethnicity, cultural background and more.  To promote workplace diversity, our Board has adopted a Diversity Policy in addition to a Workplace Anti-Discrimination & Anti-Harassment Policy.  The Diversity Policy includes a set of clear objectives as part of our corporate governance practice.  These include:

To provide flexibility to staff members.  In this context, workplace flexibility involves developing people management strategies that accommodate differences in background, perspectives and family responsibilities of staff.
To include in the recruitment process for vacant positions a diversified group (including gender diversity) of candidates.  This further extends to the interview process for vacant positions on Platinum’s Board of Directors.
To provide training opportunities with the aim of bringing through the underlying potential of staff.
Established a diversity committee comprising representatives from each business area.  The diversity committee will meet periodically and will monitor progress on Board-recommended diversity strategies and make recommendations to the Board for further diversity opportunities.

The following statistics (current as of 11 May 2016) demonstrate Platinum’s ongoing endeavours to promote diversity and flexible work arrangements.  This has allowed Platinum to exceed the country’s average in many aspects, for example, the representation of women on the board and in senior executive positions, women employed on a part-time basis, and the percentage of workforce made up of people born outside Australia.

Platinum’s efforts to create an inclusive and supportive work culture have resulted in excellent retention rates.  For example, the average investment management industry experience of our fund managers was 18.8 years (as at 11 May 2016), with an average of 14.2 years at Platinum.  The average number of years with Platinum for the remainder of the investment team was more than five years.  The average number of years at Platinum for non-investment team staff was nearly seven years.  Moreover, it is not uncommon to find departed employees re-join Platinum after spending several years in other countries or industries.
Making a Contribution to the Financial Advisory Industry
At Platinum, we believe that being a member of the financial services industry entails a duty to help improve the industry.
Financial Reform
Financial advisers play an important part in Australia’s financial services system.  The government has essentially forced the public through savings/superannuation schemes to rely on intermediaries to secure their long-term financial well-being.  However, there is confusion in our legislation as to the obligations of independence of financial advice.
In early 2014, we took the opportunity of the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) reform bill and made a submission to the Senate inquiry on this important issue.  We pointed out the huge concentration of power in the hands of the country’s four big banks and the detriments their considerable influence over financial advisers can bring to the investing public.  In highlighting the lack of protection investors face regarding the efficacy of advice obtained from financial intermediaries, we urged the lawmakers to give more consideration to the interest of the public in the FoFA reform.
Education
To play a small part in raising the professionalism in the financial advisory industry, Platinum together with the Neilson Foundation are funding a total of 20 scholarships a year at five Australian universities, each scholarship being to the value of $15,000 per year11. The scholarships are to be awarded to students who are majoring in financial planning. 40% of the scholarships awarded since the programme began in 2014 have been awarded to female students. Platinum has further committed to providing valuable work experience opportunities for two candidates from this programme each year.
Commitment to Climate Action
We are committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. Platinum continues its long-standing commitment to combating climate change with the measurement and offsetting of its carbon footprint.
