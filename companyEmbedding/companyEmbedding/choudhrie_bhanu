Emerging markets all set to become experts in handling environmental issues 










Clean
tech’s world soon to become the center of gravity in emerging markets, confirms
Bhanu Choudhrie of C&C Alpha Group 



The speed of economic change can be
overwhelming for those investing in the emerging markets. It offers huge
opportunities to the investors but at the same time it also poses some great
challenges. The social and cultural issues associated with changing markets
cannot be overlooked as growth is directly associated with it. 



In the current scenario, Global warming
comes across as the greatest challenge for investors. With more than seven
million people dying prematurely due to environmental pollution, Global Warming
is now a major issue for emerging economies worldwide. 





There is no doubt that global warming is the
biggest threat to human health but it also has the potential to become the
single biggest driver of economic transformation. Decarbonisation of economies
can affect the world in big way. It will not just affect the way we produce
power but also transform the way we grow food and live our lives. 



Expressing his concern about global warming
and various environmental issues, Bhanu Choudhrie said, “It is
often said that the sins of developed economies, whose factories belched out
fossil fuels throughout the 20th century, are being visited on
emerging markets at the very point that they are experiencing stellar economic
growth for the first time. They are being required to decarbonise, just as
demand from a nascent, voracious middle-class is taking off. 



It is quite fascinating to notice that the
innovation curve is moving east to west and north to south. Giving his opinion
about some dramatic shifts in approach coming from emerging markets, Achim
Steiner, Former Executive of the United Nations Environment Program said,
“Thailland advertises itself as a “sufficiency economy” and Bhutan talks of
“Gross National Happiness” –but these are not merely theoretical concepts,
these are national branding strategies which feed through to political
implementation” 



Interestingly, we all have this concept
fixed in our minds that wealth and technology can make us independent. On the
contrary, we are more dependent on it than ever before. It is high time that
all of us realize that we need to protect nature in order to survive.

LeaseTeam’s ASPIRE To Aid Customers Bank’s New Commercial Finance Business







Customers Bank, a state chartered, full-service US business bank, has come up with a segment to deal with end-to-end lease and loan management solutions called Customers Bank Commercial Finance (CBCF) and have chosen LeaseTeam’s ASPIRE to help them with it. This new business division would be responsible for providing equipment finance and leasing products and services for customers from different asset classes. Service vendors, independent finance companies, dealers, bank-owned leasing companies and direct customers would also be eligible for these services. ASPIRE, with an effective single system, will assist CBCF with their plans by making transactions easier; organising the adjudication process better through pipeline management and asset management. Samuel H. Smith III, managing director of CBCF, explained about the value ASPIRE would add to their plans: “ASPIRE will provide everything in an end-to-end operating system solution that our commercial finance and leasing business was looking for. 





“LeaseTeam understands our unique challenges and is providing customized solutions that will enable us to process our transactions more efficiently while providing the flexibility for our future growth and expansion into new business channels and markets. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as a result of the expert guidance that Randy Haug and his team have provided.” Randy Haug, co-founder and executive vice president at LeaseTeam said his team would work hard for Customers Bank and its clients’ success. “We’re delighted to add Samuel H. Smith III and his trusted and experienced team to our growing family of bank equipment finance companies nationwide. The synergies between our group at LeaseTeam and Sam’s team were immediate. We are currently putting our combined years of experience, trust and integrity to work in the deployment of ASPIRE, which is being configured specifically for the success of Customers Bank Commercial Finance and its clients.”Located in Portsmouth, Customers Bank Commercial Finance (CBCF) is a division of Customers Bancorp, Inc. It is known to provide a number of lease and financing products through vendor as well as direct and capital markets origination channels focused on markets such as industrial, packaging, franchise, plastics, construction, marine among others. Customers Bancorp Inc. engages in public banking services through its subsidiary Customers Bank, where the board of directors includes noted names like Bhanu Choudhrie and Jay S. Sidhu.
