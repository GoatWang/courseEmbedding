SANOOK
ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 (A Development Stage Company) 

Notes to
Financial Statements (Unaudited)
May 31, 2011

 

NOTE 1.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Sanook
Enterprises, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Nevada on September 28, 2006. The Company was formed
to engage in providing customers with custom golf packages at
different locations in Thailand.

The
Company is in the development stage. Its activities to date have
been limited to capital formation, organization, development of its
business plan and ongoing development of its website. The Company
has commenced limited operations.

NOTE 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. BASIS
OF ACCOUNTING

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of accounting. The Company has elected an August 31,
year-end.

B. BASIC
EARNINGS PER SHARE

ASC No.
260, "Earnings Per Share", specifies the computation, presentation
and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for
entities with publicly held common stock. The Company has adopted
the provisions of ASC No. 260.

Basic net
loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to
the lack of dilutive items in the Company.

C. CASH
EQUIVALENTS

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

D. USE OF
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In
accordance with ASC No. 250 all adjustments are normal and
recurring.

SANOOK
ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 (A Development Stage Company)

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)
May 31, 2011

 

NOTE 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED)

E. INCOME
TAXES

Income
taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for
Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all
temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net
operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit)
results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

F.
REVENUE

The
Company records revenue on the accrual basis when all goods and
services have been performed and delivered, the amounts are readily
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The Company has
not generated any revenue since its inception.

G.
ADVERTISING

The
Company will expense its advertising when incurred. There has been
no advertising since inception.

H.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The
Company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements
through the date the financial statements were issued and filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and believe that none
of them will have a material effect on the company's financial
statements.

NOTE 3.
GOING CONCERN

The
accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern
basis. The Company had no operations during the period from
September 28, 2006 (inception) to May 31, 2011 and generated a net
loss of $49,851. This condition raises substantial doubt about the

currently in the development stage and has minimal expenses.
Management believes that the Company's current cash of $2,249 is
not sufficient to cover the expenses they will incur during the
next twelve months.
