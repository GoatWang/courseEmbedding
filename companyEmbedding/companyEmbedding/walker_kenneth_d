                        Please donate to help out North Tonawanda firefighter Ken walker in this hard time. For those that don't know Ken received a letter in the mail threatening to leave the fire service or he will regret it. This morning his house caught on fire. I'm a fellow firefighter from a neighboring company that is trying to help someone who is in need of help. From one firefighter to another. From one human to another human. It is amazing to have to raise the goal again! The Walker family appreciates all of the generosity! New goal is now 130k!!Thank you again for all the donations!

I am the father of Shawn Moynihan. I have never been prouder of my son. He set up this go fund me account to help a brother fire fighter. He has never met Ken Walker and are not friends on face book . Do we have to be friends to want to help somebody in need that's what fire fighters do.

As a military veteran one thing that I can attest to (and I see it here) is that BROTHERHOOD starts with SERVICE. Shawn, I can tell by your efforts that you consider Ken a brother, you see past everything else and I commend you for doing this! Break the barriers and the chains racism and ignorance, by learning and valuing humanity for what it is. Vehemently oppose anything less than that.

Monday this man recieved a vulgar hate letter in his mailbox, stating essentially that black men are not welcome to be firefighters in NT and threatening him to resign before the end of the week "or else". Today they torched his apartment and altogether 4 apartments suffered serious damage. This go fund me is to help Ken and his family recoup as much as possible after all of their belongings were damaged in that fire. This man is a volunteer firefighter in North Tonawanda who needs and more than deserves our help and support. He has a young family, I do believe 3 children (I could be wrong on that number) and a wife.  He puts his life on the line for our community, please help show him that this is not acceptable in our back yard and we are behind him 100% by donating what you are able. Thank you Ken for your service. I am so sorry this is happening to you and your family.

OK LISTEN!! To all of you who keep posting that Ken doesn't want a go fund me page blah blah etc...... this may be true but put yourself in his shoes he is a proud father/ firefighter trying to take care of his family and get through a hard time would you want anyone to help you or would you do everything you can to help your family?  YES he said he doesn't want a go fund me or money from anyone but this man lost EVERYTHING sometimes we don't realize we need help or are to proud to accept it. I am one of his fellow firefighters and I understand where his pride is coming from we are made to protect and care for others that's what we're trained to do but sometimes even as strong as we are we have to take help where help is given. This doesn't make one weaker or less of a man etc...... That being said this campaign should continue to grow. To the questions of legitimacy go fund me insures strict guidelines including entering of several forms of personal information and states in its contracts that shall it be known the funds not be delivered to proper person legal actions will be enforced etc..... However if you do still feel uncomfortable you can always as said come down to Gratwick Hose fire hall 110 Ward Rd North Tonawanda NY 14120 on this Sunday  Aug 7th between 10-2 to give donations of any sort to Ken and His Family

Ken Walker may be saying that he doesn't want to burden people, but one of the reasons I donated was to protest hate and prejudice. I want my few bucks to show that I will stand against acts of violence. So, it's not just about helping Ken and his family. It's about taking a stand of my own. BTW: I'm so happy to have an easy way to donate. I know that GoFundMe charges fees, but my guess is that more people donate when they can follow a link and quickly pay. People also want to be part of something they can watch grow and spread, which will ultimately mean more money for this worthy cause. Donate in a way that makes you comfortable. There is a lot of satisfaction in seeing people stand together--even if it's in cyberspace! Kudos to Shawn for setting it up, and to Ken and his family: you have the support of more people than you know or can imagine.

North Tonawanda Police Department 12 mins ·  Please don't post links to Go Fund Me. Please do all of your donations through Gratwick Fire Department. GoFundMe will deduct a 5% fee from each of your donations, and you’ll also be charged a 2.9% + $0.30 fee from WePay for each payment you request. As an example: If you raise $10,000 during your GoFundMe campaign, the company will keep $500, and you’ll be charged an additional $300 in processing fees to complete payment (assuming you only request it once). This means that on a $10,000 campaign, you’ll end up receiving $9,200 after everything is said and done. Any links will be removed from this page.

To anyone who might question the legitimacy of this campaign: I understand the hesitance and skepticism. I even called the fire company to verify this is a valid GoFundMe.  However, being too impatient to wait for a return call (and knowing the likelihood they're under an avalanche of voicemails), it only took a few minutes of vetting online through trustworthy news outlets to determine that Mr. Moynihan's campaign is the real deal.  Thank you, Shawn, for starting this for the Walker family. Love really is the best way to conquer hate. I know how wonderful the Buffalo-area people are, having lived there for six years. You've given us a chance to show appreciation for Mr. Walker's bravery and love for his dear family.

Donald Trump has unfortunately unleashed a whole bunch of racists in this country. Yesterday I met Daniel Webster a Republican running for congress in Florida. He asked me for my vote this Nov. and I told him I could not give him my vote because there were too many racists in his party. I went on to say I don't think all Republicans are racists but if you are a racists the Republican Party is your party. To my surprise he replied you are right.

I hope to God this money is seriously going to the Walker family.. I just saw one gentlemen say the person who created this page is not friends with Kenneth nor knows him and there are 2 other Go Fund Me pages for Kenneth Walker and since I don't feel comfortable donating to this page I will and encourage others to donate at his fire dept. on Sunday from 10am - 2pm at Gratwick Hose Fire Department at 110 Ward Rd., North Tonawanda.

Nobody should ever have to go through what this man and his family are going through. It does not matter what color we are on the outside- we all bleed red. Thank you for all you do. I hope they find out soon who is doing this. We had a fire in our home 2-1/2 years ago. It is a very devasting thing and takes a long time to recover from. Keep strong.

As a military veteran one thing that I can attest to (and I see it here) is that BROTHERHOOD starts with SERVICE. Shawn, I can tell by your efforts that you consider Ken a brother, you see past everything else and I commend you for doing this! Break the barriers and the chains racism and ignorance, by learning and valuing humanity for what it is. Vehemently oppose anything less than that.

Monday this man recieved a vulgar hate letter in his mailbox, stating essentially that black men are not welcome to be firefighters in NT and threatening him to resign before the end of the week "or else". Today they torched his apartment and altogether 4 apartments suffered serious damage. This go fund me is to help Ken and his family recoup as much as possible after all of their belongings were damaged in that fire. This man is a volunteer firefighter in North Tonawanda who needs and more than deserves our help and support. He has a young family, I do believe 3 children (I could be wrong on that number) and a wife.  He puts his life on the line for our community, please help show him that this is not acceptable in our back yard and we are behind him 100% by donating what you are able. Thank you Ken for your service. I am so sorry this is happening to you and your family.

OK LISTEN!! To all of you who keep posting that Ken doesn't want a go fund me page blah blah etc...... this may be true but put yourself in his shoes he is a proud father/ firefighter trying to take care of his family and get through a hard time would you want anyone to help you or would you do everything you can to help your family?  YES he said he doesn't want a go fund me or money from anyone but this man lost EVERYTHING sometimes we don't realize we need help or are to proud to accept it. I am one of his fellow firefighters and I understand where his pride is coming from we are made to protect and care for others that's what we're trained to do but sometimes even as strong as we are we have to take help where help is given. This doesn't make one weaker or less of a man etc...... That being said this campaign should continue to grow. To the questions of legitimacy go fund me insures strict guidelines including entering of several forms of personal information and states in its contracts that shall it be known the funds not be delivered to proper person legal actions will be enforced etc..... However if you do still feel uncomfortable you can always as said come down to Gratwick Hose fire hall 110 Ward Rd North Tonawanda NY 14120 on this Sunday  Aug 7th between 10-2 to give donations of any sort to Ken and His Family

Ken Walker may be saying that he doesn't want to burden people, but one of the reasons I donated was to protest hate and prejudice. I want my few bucks to show that I will stand against acts of violence. So, it's not just about helping Ken and his family. It's about taking a stand of my own. BTW: I'm so happy to have an easy way to donate. I know that GoFundMe charges fees, but my guess is that more people donate when they can follow a link and quickly pay. People also want to be part of something they can watch grow and spread, which will ultimately mean more money for this worthy cause. Donate in a way that makes you comfortable. There is a lot of satisfaction in seeing people stand together--even if it's in cyberspace! Kudos to Shawn for setting it up, and to Ken and his family: you have the support of more people than you know or can imagine.

North Tonawanda Police Department 12 mins ·  Please don't post links to Go Fund Me. Please do all of your donations through Gratwick Fire Department. GoFundMe will deduct a 5% fee from each of your donations, and you’ll also be charged a 2.9% + $0.30 fee from WePay for each payment you request. As an example: If you raise $10,000 during your GoFundMe campaign, the company will keep $500, and you’ll be charged an additional $300 in processing fees to complete payment (assuming you only request it once). This means that on a $10,000 campaign, you’ll end up receiving $9,200 after everything is said and done. Any links will be removed from this page.

To anyone who might question the legitimacy of this campaign: I understand the hesitance and skepticism. I even called the fire company to verify this is a valid GoFundMe.  However, being too impatient to wait for a return call (and knowing the likelihood they're under an avalanche of voicemails), it only took a few minutes of vetting online through trustworthy news outlets to determine that Mr. Moynihan's campaign is the real deal.  Thank you, Shawn, for starting this for the Walker family. Love really is the best way to conquer hate. I know how wonderful the Buffalo-area people are, having lived there for six years. You've given us a chance to show appreciation for Mr. Walker's bravery and love for his dear family.

Donald Trump has unfortunately unleashed a whole bunch of racists in this country. Yesterday I met Daniel Webster a Republican running for congress in Florida. He asked me for my vote this Nov. and I told him I could not give him my vote because there were too many racists in his party. I went on to say I don't think all Republicans are racists but if you are a racists the Republican Party is your party. To my surprise he replied you are right.

I hope to God this money is seriously going to the Walker family.. I just saw one gentlemen say the person who created this page is not friends with Kenneth nor knows him and there are 2 other Go Fund Me pages for Kenneth Walker and since I don't feel comfortable donating to this page I will and encourage others to donate at his fire dept. on Sunday from 10am - 2pm at Gratwick Hose Fire Department at 110 Ward Rd., North Tonawanda.

Nobody should ever have to go through what this man and his family are going through. It does not matter what color we are on the outside- we all bleed red. Thank you for all you do. I hope they find out soon who is doing this. We had a fire in our home 2-1/2 years ago. It is a very devasting thing and takes a long time to recover from. Keep strong.
