About Us






Johnny Farming Company has been established since 1976 and imports and distributes tyres, jacks, pumps and agricultural products. The family-owned business has progressed and dramatically diversified from its origins as a cane farming enterprise.
John Galea (the namesake and owner of Johnny Farming Company), took over the cane farm from his parents, who had purchased the property in the 1950's. Adapting to changing times John saw the need to expand the business and moved into trucking in the 1980s. After the success of his venture into trucking, John embarked on further diversification and began selling and repairing tractors. In 2000 he extended his business again, selling large earthmoving tyres. By 2005, John decided to set up an office in China to source tyres for all types of vehicles. He also began importing a vast range of other products, specialising in trucking and agriculture.
Johnny Farming Company specialises in tyres, importing tyres for a wide range of vehicle and machinery, as well as agricultural implements and machinery. John strives to source whatever products his client's require for a competitive price. With an office in China, he now has easy access to a range of suppliers ensuring consistent supply.
Contact John and his team today if you are interested in importing a specific item from China, or you would like to purchase any tyres, trucking or agricultural accessories.
