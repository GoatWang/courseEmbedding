Creating Choices for Women. Creating Opportunities for Goldcorp.
The logic is simple. Any business will be better positioned to succeed if it can make full use of the talents and capabilities of its entire workforce. 

That's why we created Creating Choices, a development, training and mentoring initiative for women at Goldcorp. The principles behind the program are the same ones that guide us in all our initiatives: Goldcorp wants everyone to contribute and we are focused on supporting and developing our people. 

Drawing on the power of shared experience and mutual support, our Creating Choices program brings together small groups of female staff at our operating sites and corporate offices. The program is inclusive, so regardless of role or rank, any woman at Goldcorp can participate, and every woman will be welcomed. 

The program is voluntary – a tremendous way to build informal networks – and, once it gets going, virtually self-sufficient. Creating Choices is also self-contained, as participants in each group, including the leaders, all come from the same site or office. 

Goldcorp knows how to add value. Creating Choices was developed by Goldcorp, and it includes, as its learning component, Taking the Stage®, a program developed by the Humphrey Group that helps women develop a confident presence. 

Creating Choices was launched in Vancouver in 2010, and will be launched more broadly across Goldcorp in  2011.



Peñasquito Opening – A Celebration of Opportunity
The official opening of the Peñasquito mine, located near the city of Mazapil in the Central Mexican province of Zacatecas, was quite a party. There was music, spectacle, fireworks and a cast of dignitaries that included Mexican President Felipe Calderón.

However, while the opening provided an occasion, the real cause for celebration was the range of benefits and opportunities that Goldcorp's Peñasquito mine will create for the people of the region.

To date, Goldcorp has invested CDN $1.7 billion in the area's economic growth. On both a direct and indirect basis, this has led to the creation of more than 16,000 jobs, most of which will go to people in the Mazapil district. Goldcorp's investment has also resulted in the development of medical clinics, community amenities, a water purification plant, houses, schools and training for teachers.

As President Calderón noted, through Peñasquito, Goldcorp has established "a path to progress" for the area. Goldcorp is also working to support and empower people and groups, including women, single mothers and the elderly, who are all too often left behind, even during times of prosperity.

Goldcorp is committed to making a sustainable contribution to the Zacatecas region. We've learned through experience that supporting the communities near our operations is not only the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. It is an essential step in creating value and opportunity for all of our stakeholders.



Annual Decant Closing Ceremony at Musselwhite
October 10, 2010
As a form of giving thanks and respect to the land and the water that surrounds us, representatives from the local First Nation communities visit the mine site every year to perform a religious ceremony and bless the water prior to releasing it through the treatment wetland and into the natural environment.
Musselwhite is located within traditional First Nations territory. Each year, in early summer, elders and other representatives from local First Nations communities come to Musselwhite for the annual Decant Opening Ceremony. This year's ceremony took place on June 2, 2010. The elders perform a blessing on the water used in our operations. After the blessing, the water is released into our treatment wetland. There it is naturally purified before re–entering the larger environmental system.

In early fall, the elders and other community members return to mark the annual Decant Closing, and another successful year of effluent release, with a ceremony of thanksgiving. At the end of the ceremony, local First Nations youth close the decant valve, stopping the flow of effluent into the treatment wetland until next year's opening ceremony.

These annual ceremonies remind us of the value and importance of a healthy environment. They also strengthen our partnerships with local First Nations communities, emphasize our shared commitment to environmental responsibility, and highlight potential career opportunities at the mine that are available to First Nations youth.

Materials Stewardship | Product Handling | Lead and Zinc Concentrate
Goldcorp mines gold- and silver-bearing ore, processes the ore and produces doré bars, which are unrefined gold and silver bullion bars. The doré bars are then transferred by secure means to precious metals refineries to be further processed into almost-pure metal. 

Gold and silver doré bars pose no environmental or health risks; and they can be disposed of in this form without environmental or social impacts. As such, we have not developed detailed protocols or procedures relating to product responsibility (other than for product security), and there were no instances of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our products in 2010.

Materials Stewardship
Gold is used as bullion and in jewellery, glass and electronics, with jewellery consuming about 75% of all gold produced. Silver is valued as a precious metal, and its halide salts (especially silver nitrate) are also widely used in photography. The major outlets for silver are photography, the electrical and electronic industries, and domestic use (as cutlery, jewellery and mirrors). 

Both gold and silver are extensively recycled. Mining accounts for about two-thirds of the global supply of gold. The other third comes from existing supplies – mainly recycled scrap gold (e.g., from jewellery, dental materials, plating solutions and electronic equipment) and gold from central banks. Photographic wastes, spent catalysts and electronic scrap are the major sources of materials for silver recycling. 

Product Handling
Goldcorp sells into the worldwide gold and silver market and, as a result, is not dependent on a particular purchaser. We sell our products to refineries or smelters for secondary treatment – not directly to the public. We have a commercial relationship with our customers, and any issues that may arise are addressed according to the terms of our mutual contractual obligations. There were no complaints, incidences of breaches of customer privacy, or losses of customer data in 2009. We are unaware of any outstanding customer issues. 

The doré bars produced at the mine site do not carry public labelling. They are transferred to a refinery for further processing to the London Bullion Market (LBM) standard. Once produced, all 99.99% gold bars are allocated a bar number and imprinted with an LBM registered refiner's mark. There were no instances of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning product information and the labelling of our products in 2010.

There are no codes or voluntary standards that relate to marketing communications regarding gold and/or silver doré bars. Goldcorp is a member of the World Gold Council. As the gold industry's key marketing body, the World Gold Council works closely with jewellery retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers, banks, investment companies and distribution specialists to promote the use of gold in jewellery and industrial applications, as well as by central banks and other official sector institutions. There were no instances of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning marketing communications in 2010.

There were no fines for non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning the provision and use of our products in 2010.

Lead and Zinc Concentrate
With the development of the Peñasquito mine in Mexico, Goldcorp has added lead and zinc concentrates to its product mix. Trial shipments of concentrate commenced at the end of 2009 and continued through 2010. Peñasquito completed commissioning and achieved commercial production on September 1, 2010.

While lead has been mined and used in industrial and household products for centuries and zinc is a trace element essential to human health, both pose risks to human health and the environment when not managed correctly. Concentrates containing combinations of gold, silver, lead and zinc are loaded onto highway road vehicles for transport to in-country smelters or to sea ports for export to foreign smelters in Asia, Europe and North America. Transportation of such concentrate is subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to, road blocks, terrorism, weather conditions and environmental liabilities in the event of an accident or leak. Peñasquito has developed emergency response plans to cover the trucking of its concentrate.

Goldcorp does not produce lead or zinc products that are sold directly to the public.

Goldcorp Inc. is a gold production company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company employs about 15,800 people worldwide,[4] engaged in gold mining and related activities including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Goldcorp’s operating assets include four mines in Canada, two mines in Mexico, and four in Central and South America.[citation needed] As of the third quarter of 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold.[5]
In June 2016, Goldcorp was named one of Corporate Knights magazine's Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.[6] In the same year, the company was also ranked among Canada's Top 100 Employers. Goldcorp has repeatedly been accused of harming the environment, livestock, and public health in multiple studies by advocacy groups and activists, contaminating areas with toxic heavy metals by its mining activities. These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law.[7] The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved[8] since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations.

[9]
In April 2017 Goldcorp closed on the sale of its Los Filos gold mine Guerrero State, Mexico to Leagold Mining for US$350 million. The transaction included US$279 million in cash and $71 million in common shares of Leadgold. Goldcorp also nominated Russell Ball the Leagold's board of directors. [10]

[citation needed]
History[edit]
Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. Following a period of M&A activity, the company quickly grew to become a leading gold producer. The company is focused on responsible mining practices with safe, low-cost production in areas of low political risk. Through the consistent application of its business strategy, Goldcorp has achieved significant growth, industry recognition, and numerous awards.
In 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen launched the Goldcorp Challenge, sharing with the public the company’s geological data with the offer of $575,000 in prizes to those who could help locate Red Lake mine’s next six million ounces of gold. The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves. The challenge helped turn the company from a struggling enterprise into one of the most profitable in the industry.
In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

Goldcorp Inc. is a gold production company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company employs about 15,800 people worldwide,[4] engaged in gold mining and related activities including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Goldcorp’s operating assets include four mines in Canada, two mines in Mexico, and four in Central and South America.[citation needed] As of the third quarter of 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold.[5]
In June 2016, Goldcorp was named one of Corporate Knights magazine's Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.[6] In the same year, the company was also ranked among Canada's Top 100 Employers. Goldcorp has repeatedly been accused of harming the environment, livestock, and public health in multiple studies by advocacy groups and activists, contaminating areas with toxic heavy metals by its mining activities. These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law.[7] The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved[8] since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations.

History[edit]
Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. Following a period of M&A activity, the company quickly grew to become a leading gold producer. The company is focused on responsible mining practices with safe, low-cost production in areas of low political risk. Through the consistent application of its business strategy, Goldcorp has achieved significant growth, industry recognition, and numerous awards.
In 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen launched the Goldcorp Challenge, sharing with the public the company’s geological data with the offer of $575,000 in prizes to those who could help locate Red Lake mine’s next six million ounces of gold. The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves. The challenge helped turn the company from a struggling enterprise into one of the most profitable in the industry.
In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

VANCOUVER, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE:    GG) ("Goldcorp" or the "Company") today reported its second quarter 2017 results.  








Second Quarter Highlights

Net earnings for the second quarter of 2017 were $135 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss of $78 million, or $0.09 per share, for the second quarter of 2016. Operating cash flows for the second quarter of 2017 were $158 million. Adjusted operating cash flows were $320 million(1) for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $204 million for the same period in the prior year. 
Gold production of 635,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs ("AISC") of $800 per ounce, compared to 613,000 ounces at AISC of $1,067 for the second quarter of 2016(1). 2017 guidance reconfirmed for gold production of 2.5 million ounces (+/- 5%). 2017 AISC guidance has been improved to $825(2) per ounce (+/- 5%) from $850 per ounce, reflecting the progress the Company has made on its initiative to realize $250 million in sustainable annual efficiencies by the middle of 2018. 
Program to implement $250 million of sustainable annual efficiencies by the middle of 2018 on track with $200 million expected to be achieved in 2017. More than 100% of the targeted efficiencies have been identified, with the program likely to be extended and the efficiency target increased, after we achieve our current target. 
Portfolio optimization continues to drive increasing net asset value ("NAV") per share. The Company's plan to deliver a 20% increase in gold production, a 20% increase in gold reserves and a 20% reduction in AISC over the next five years advanced with the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation in the Maricunga district in Chile, the divestiture of $500 million of non-core assets in Mexico and Guatemala and solid execution on the Company's key growth projects. 

"We have now delivered four consecutive quarters of on target gold production while also consistently expanding our margins per ounce of gold sales through our successful efficiency program," said David Garofalo, President & Chief Executive Officer.  "In addition, over the last 18 months, $500 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales has been reinvested in two new projects that has seen us increase our gold reserves from 41 million to 50 million ounces.  We are targeting a further 20% increase in gold reserves over the next five years while we increase production by 20% and drive down our all-in sustaining costs by 20%, from our existing portfolio of mines and projects."

Board Appointment and Senior Management Change
The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Matthew Coon Come to the Company's Board of Directors, effective July 26, 2017.
"Matthew is a tremendous addition to our Board of Directors," said Ian Telfer, Chairman of the Board of Goldcorp.  "His dedication and leadership in advocating for the rights of Indigenous people, both in Canada and internationally, will be instrumental as we continue to strengthen relationships with our community partners."
Mr. Coon Come, 61, is a national and international leader and an advocate of indigenous rights. He is the former Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees and the former Chairperson of the Cree Regional Authority, positions he held for over 20 years. He also served as National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations from 2000 to 2003. In recognition of his leadership in environmental stewardship, Mr. Coon Come was awarded the Goldman Prize in 1994, considered by many as the "Nobel Prize of Environmental Awards". 
Mr. Coon Come studied political science, economics, native studies and courses in law at both Trent and McGill Universities. He also received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Trent University in 1998 and the University of Toronto in 2000, in recognition for his leadership and the significance of his work. He is currently a Director of Labrador Iron Mines Holdings Limited.
The Company also announced that, as part of a planned succession, Russell Ball, Executive Vice-President Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development, will be leaving the organization.  Mr. Ball has served as Goldcorp's CFO since March 2016, after joining Goldcorp in 2013 as Executive Vice President, Projects and Capital Management.
Jason Attew, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy, will assume the role of EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development in the coming months following completion of the transition.  Mr. Attew joined Goldcorp in August 2016, having most recently served as Managing Director, Global Metals and Mining for BMO Capital Markets.
"On behalf of the management team and the board of directors, I would like to thank Russell and wish him success in the future," said David Garofalo, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Russell has been an outstanding business partner to me since my appointment as CEO in 2016.  Since assuming the CFO role, Russell has done an outstanding job in restructuring our finance organization, leaving it a much stronger function.  I look forward to working with Jason as he assumes leadership of our finance organization."

 Footnotes  






 1. 
 The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable basis (Goldcorp's share) throughout this release. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations and projects and the Company's share from Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera, Leagold and NuevaUnión.  






 2. 
 Adjusted operating cash flows comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes, calculated on an attributable basis to include the Company's share of Alumbrera, Pueblo Viejo, Leagold and NuevaUnión's operating cash flows before working capital changes. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash. 







 The following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated financial statements to Goldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows:

 3. 
 "Cash costs: by product" per ounce and "AISC" per ounce are non-GAAP financial performance measures.  







 Cash costs: by-product: 







 Total cash costs: by-product incorporate Goldcorp's share of all production costs, including adjustments to inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's closed mines which are non-cash in nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, lead, zinc and copper credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the Company's commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may impact the Company's operating costs.  







 In addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs: by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production.  







 The Company reports total cash costs: by-product on a gold ounces sold basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. 







 AISC: 







 AISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, mine-site exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, therefore growth capital is excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including non-sustaining expenditures, tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also excluded. 







 The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions. 







 The Company reports AISC on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company follows the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies.

        Goldcorp Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
      

        PR Newswire
      

        VANCOUVER, July 26, 2017
      



VANCOUVER, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/
        - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) ("Goldcorp"
        or the "Company") today reported its second quarter 2017
        results. 
      

Second Quarter Highlights



Net earnings for the second quarter of 2017 were
          $135 million, or
          $0.16 per share, compared
          to a net loss of $78
          million, or $0.09
          per share, for the second quarter of 2016. Operating
          cash flows for the second quarter of 2017 were
          $158 million. Adjusted
          operating cash flows were $320
          million(1) for the second quarter of
          2017 compared to $204
          million for the same period in the prior
          year.



Gold production of 635,000 ounces at all-in sustaining
          costs ("AISC") of $800 per
          ounce, compared to 613,000 ounces at AISC of $1,067 for the second quarter of
          2016(1). 2017 guidance reconfirmed for
          gold production of 2.5 million ounces (+/- 5%). 2017 AISC
          guidance has been improved to $825(2) per ounce (+/- 5%)
          from $850 per ounce,
          reflecting the progress the Company has made on its
          initiative to realize $250
          million in sustainable annual efficiencies by the
          middle of 2018.



Program to implement $250
          million of sustainable annual efficiencies by the
          middle of 2018 on track with $200
          million expected to be achieved in 2017. More
          than 100% of the targeted efficiencies have been
          identified, with the program likely to be extended and
          the efficiency target increased, after we achieve our
          current target.



Portfolio optimization continues to drive increasing
          net asset value ("NAV") per share. The Company's plan
          to deliver a 20% increase in gold production, a 20%
          increase in gold reserves and a 20% reduction in AISC
          over the next five years advanced with the formation of a
          50/50 joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation in the
          Maricunga district in Chile, the divestiture of
          $500 million of non-core
          assets in Mexico and
          Guatemala and solid
          execution on the Company's key growth projects.
        


        "We have now delivered four consecutive quarters of on
        target gold production while also consistently expanding
        our margins per ounce of gold sales through our successful
        efficiency program," said David
        Garofalo, President & Chief Executive Officer.
         "In addition, over the last 18 months, $500 million of proceeds from non-core
        asset sales has been reinvested in two new projects that
        has seen us increase our gold reserves from 41 million to
        50 million ounces.  We are targeting a further 20%
        increase in gold reserves over the next five years while we
        increase production by 20% and drive down our all-in
        sustaining costs by 20%, from our existing portfolio of
        mines and projects."

Board Appointment and Senior Management Change


        The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of
        Matthew Coon Come to the
        Company's Board of Directors, effective July 26, 2017.
      

        "Matthew is a tremendous addition to our Board of
        Directors," said Ian Telfer,
        Chairman of the Board of Goldcorp.  "His dedication
        and leadership in advocating for the rights of Indigenous
        people, both in Canada and
        internationally, will be instrumental as we continue to
        strengthen relationships with our community partners."
      

        Mr. Coon Come, 61, is a national and international leader
        and an advocate of indigenous rights. He is the former
        Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees and the
        former Chairperson of the Cree Regional Authority,
        positions he held for over 20 years. He also served as
        National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations from 2000
        to 2003. In recognition of his leadership in environmental
        stewardship, Mr. Coon Come was awarded the Goldman Prize in
        1994, considered by many as the "Nobel Prize of
        Environmental Awards".
      

        Mr. Coon Come studied political science, economics, native
        studies and courses in law at both Trent and McGill Universities. He also
        received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Trent University in 1998 and the
        University of Toronto in 2000,
        in recognition for his leadership and the significance of
        his work. He is currently a Director of Labrador Iron Mines
        Holdings Limited.
      

        The Company also announced that, as part of a planned
        succession, Russell Ball,
        Executive Vice-President Chief Financial Officer and
        Corporate Development, will be leaving the organization.
         Mr. Ball has served as Goldcorp's CFO since
        March 2016, after joining
        Goldcorp in 2013 as Executive Vice President, Projects and
        Capital Management.
      

Jason Attew, Senior Vice
        President, Corporate Development and Strategy, will assume
        the role of EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate
        Development in the coming months following completion of
        the transition.  Mr. Attew joined Goldcorp in
        August 2016, having most
        recently served as Managing Director, Global Metals and
        Mining for BMO Capital Markets.
      

        "On behalf of the management team and the board of
        directors, I would like to thank Russell and wish him
        success in the future," said David
        Garofalo, President and Chief Executive
        Officer.  "Russell has been an outstanding business
        partner to me since my appointment as CEO in 2016. 
        Since assuming the CFO role, Russell has done an
        outstanding job in restructuring our finance organization,
        leaving it a much stronger function.  I look forward
        to working with Jason as he assumes leadership of our
        finance organization."

The Company has included
                non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable
                basis (Goldcorp's share) throughout this release.
                Attributable performance measures include the
                Company's mining operations and projects and the
                Company's share from Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera,
                Leagold and NuevaUnión.

Adjusted operating cash
                flows comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash
                flows before working capital changes, calculated on
                an attributable basis to include the Company's
                share of Alumbrera, Pueblo Viejo, Leagold and
                NuevaUnión's operating cash flows before working
                capital changes. The Company believes that, in
                addition to conventional measures prepared in
                accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain
                investors use this information to evaluate the
                Company's performance and ability to operate
                without reliance on additional external funding or
                use of available cash.

















The following table
                provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by
                operating activities in the consolidated financial

"Cash costs: by product"
                per ounce and "AISC" per ounce are non-GAAP
                financial performance measures.

















Cash costs:
                by-product:

















Total cash costs:
                by-product incorporate Goldcorp's share of all
                production costs, including adjustments to
                inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in
                estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the
                Company's closed mines which are non-cash in
                nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product
                silver, lead, zinc and copper credits, and
                treatment and refining charges included within
                revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for
                realized gains and losses arising on the Company's
                commodity and foreign currency contracts which the
                Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to
                fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating
                oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may
                impact the Company's operating costs.

















In addition to
                conventional measures, the Company assesses this
                per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the
                impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product
                credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that
                the non-controllable and controllable variability
                is independently addressed. The Company uses total
                cash costs: by product per gold ounce to monitor
                its operating performance internally, including
                operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment
                of potential development projects and acquisition
                targets. The Company believes this measure provides
                investors and analysts with useful information
                about the Company's underlying cash costs of
                operations and the impact of by-product credits on
                the Company's cost structure and is a relevant
                metric used to understand the Company's operating
                profitability and ability to generate cash flow.
                When deriving the production costs associated with
                an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product
                credits as the Company considers that the cost to
                produce the gold is reduced as a result of the
                by-product sales incidental to the gold production
                process, thereby allowing the Company's management
                and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of
                gold production.

















The Company reports total
                cash costs: by-product on a gold ounces sold basis.
                In the gold mining industry, this is a common
                performance measure but does not have any
                standardized meaning. The Company follows the
                recommendations of the Gold Institute Production
                Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased
                operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and
                represented a global group of producers of gold and
                gold products. The production cost standard
                developed by the Gold Institute remains the
                generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs
                of production by gold mining companies.

















AISC:

















AISC include total
                production cash costs incurred at the Company's
                mining operations, which forms the basis of the
                Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the
                Company includes sustaining capital expenditures,
                corporate administrative expense, mine-site
                exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation
                cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks
                to reflect the full cost of gold production from
                current operations, therefore growth capital is
                excluded. Certain other cash expenditures,
                including non-sustaining expenditures, tax
                payments, dividends and financing costs are also
                excluded.

















The Company believes that
                this measure represents the total costs of
                producing gold from current operations, and
                provides the Company and other stakeholders of the
                Company with additional information of the
                Company's operational performance and ability to
                generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance
                measure, allows the Company to assess its ability
                to support capital expenditures and to sustain
                future production from the generation of operating
                cash flows. This information provides management
                with the ability to more actively manage capital
                programs and to make more prudent capital
                investment decisions.

















The Company reports AISC
                on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance
                measure was adopted as a result of an initiative
                undertaken within the gold mining industry;
                however, this performance measure has no
                standardized meaning and should not be considered
                in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
                performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The
                Company follows the guidance note released by the
                World Gold Council, which became effective January
                1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory
                market development organization for the gold
                industry whose members comprise global senior gold
                mining companies.

If silver, copper, lead

                costs for the three months ended June 30, 2017
                would have been $644 per ounce of gold (three

As described above, AISC
                include total production cash costs incurred at the

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking
        Statements


        This press release contains "forward-looking statements"
        within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States
        Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the
        United States Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  the
        United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
        1995, or in releases made by the United States Securities
        and Exchange Commission, all as may be amended from time to
        time, and "forward-looking information" under the
        provisions of applicable Canadian securities legislation,
        concerning the business, operations and financial
        performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking
        statements include, but are not limited to, the future
        price of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, the
        estimation of Mineral Reserves (as defined below) and
        Mineral Resources (as defined below), the realization of
        Mineral Reserve estimates, the timing and amount of
        estimated future production, costs of production, targeted
        cost reductions, capital expenditures, free cash flow,
        costs and timing of the development of new deposits,
        success of exploration activities, permitting time lines,
        hedging practices, currency exchange rate fluctuations,
        requirements for additional capital, government regulation
        of mining operations, environmental risks, unanticipated
        reclamation expenses, timing and possible outcome of
        pending litigation, title disputes or claims and
        limitations on insurance coverage. Generally, these
        forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
        forward-looking terminology such as "plans", "expects" ,
        "is expected", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates",
        "forecasts", "intends", "anticipates" , "believes", or
        variations or comparable language of such words and phrases
        or statements that certain actions, events or results
        "may", "could", "would", "should", "might" or "will be
        taken", "occur" or "be achieved" or the negative
        connotation thereof.
      

        Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a
        number of factors and assumptions that, if untrue, could
        cause the actual results, performances or achievements of
        Goldcorp to be materially different from future results,
        performances or achievements expressed or implied by such
        statements. Such statements and information are based on
        numerous assumptions regarding present and future business
        strategies and the environment in which Goldcorp will
        operate in the future, including the price of gold,
        anticipated costs and ability to achieve goals. Certain
        important factors that could cause actual results,
        performances or achievements to differ materially from
        those in the forward-looking statements include, among
        others, gold price volatility, discrepancies between actual
        and estimated production, Mineral Reserves and Mineral
        Resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational
        and development risks, litigation risks, regulatory
        restrictions (including environmental regulatory
        restrictions and liability), changes in national and local
        government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations
        and/or change in the administration of laws, policies and
        practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and
        political or economic developments in Canada, the
        United States and other jurisdictions in which the
        Company does or may carry on business in the future,
        delays, suspension and technical challenges associated with
        capital projects, higher prices for fuel, steel, power,
        labour and other consumables, currency fluctuations, the
        speculative nature of gold exploration, the global economic
        climate, dilution, share price volatility, competition,
        loss of key employees, additional funding requirements and
        defective title to mineral claims or property. Although
        Goldcorp believes its expectations are based upon
        reasonable assumptions and has attempted to identify
        important factors that could cause actual actions, events
        or results to differ materially from those described in
        forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that
        cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated,
        estimated or intended.
      

        Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown
        risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may
        cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or
        achievements of Goldcorp to be materially different from
        those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
        statements, including but not limited to: risks related to
        international operations, including economic and political
        instability in foreign jurisdictions in which Goldcorp
        operates; risks related to current global financial
        conditions; risks related to joint venture operations;
        actual results of current exploration activities; actual
        results of current reclamation activities; environmental
        risks; conclusions of economic evaluations; changes in
        project parameters as plans continue to be refined; future
        prices of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc; possible
        variations in ore reserves, grade or recovery rates;
        failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as
        anticipated; mine development and operating risks;
        accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining
        industry; risks associated with restructuring and
        cost-efficiency initiatives; delays in obtaining
        governmental approvals or financing or in the completion of
        development or construction activities; risks related to
        the integration of acquisitions; risks related to
        indebtedness and the service of such indebtedness, as well
        as those factors discussed in the section entitled
        "Description of the Business – Risk Factors" in Goldcorp's
        most recent annual information form  available on
        SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.
        Although Goldcorp has attempted to identify important
        factors that could cause actual results to differ
        materially from those contained in forward-looking
        statements, there may be other factors that cause results
        not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can
        be no assurance that such statements will prove to be
        accurate, as actual results and future events could differ
        materially from those anticipated in such statements.
        Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on
        forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
        made as of the date hereof and, accordingly, are subject to
        change after such date. Except as otherwise indicated by
        Goldcorp, these statements do not reflect the potential
        impact of any non-recurring or other special items or of
        any disposition, monetization, merger, acquisition, other
        business combination or other transaction that may be
        announced or that may occur after the date hereof.
        Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of
        providing information about management's current
        expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to
        get a better understanding of Goldcorp's operating
        environment. Goldcorp does not intend or undertake to
        publicly update any forward-looking statements that are
        included in this document, whether as a result of new
        information, future events or otherwise, except in
        accordance with applicable securities laws.

Message from President & CEO, David Garofalo
“In 2016, we undertook a significant restructuring to substantially grow the net asset value per share of Goldcorp by decentralizing the business to drive accountability down to the mine sites, significantly reducing operating costs, selling non-core assets and reinvesting that capital into a robust internal pipeline and a new geologically prospective mining camp in the Yukon. This culminated in the January 2017 announcement of our ambitious 20/20/20 five year growth program that would see Goldcorp deliver a 20% increase in production, a 20% increase in gold reserves and a 20% decrease in all-in sustaining costs, positioning the company to drive increasing NAV per share.”

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018                                                   Goldcorp Inc.
