No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Choosing your coverage amount

How much coverage do you need?

Too little and you’ll want more later. Too much and you’re overpaying. Fortunately, you can find out how much coverage you need to fully protect your loved ones in seconds.



Employer-paid coverage may not be enough
Most employee life insurance only offers 1-2 years of salary. But two years will go by faster than you think. Plus, that coverage lapses as soon as you change jobs. So protect your family on your terms with your own life insurance policy.

Be sure to think ahead
Do you know how much your financial obligations may increase over time? Once you factor in child care, mortgages, college expenses, healthcare costs, debt and inflation, what you need today may not necessarily be what your family will need tomorrow. So when considering coverage amount, be sure to think ahead.

 
 




1More than half of all SBLI guaranteed level premium term life insurance applications, completed using our Accelerated Underwriting process, are issued in 15 days or less. According to the LOMA (Life Office Management Association) 2013 Individual Life STTA Report, the national average to issue a term life insurance policy is 30.1 days.

Term Life vs. Whole Life


What kind of life insurance do I need?

Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain period of time. The term—the length of time which your premiums remain the same—is typically chosen based on the number of years your family would be vulnerable if you were no longer there to provide for them. Whether it’s during your working years, your kids’ college years, or the length of your mortgage, you buy a term policy for a specific period of time.
Whole life provides lifelong protection and includes a guaranteed cash value which accumulates tax-advantaged over time. You can borrow from the guaranteed cash value for any reason you choose, including paying for your kids’ tuition or as a supplemental source of retirement income for you and your spouse.

Answers to Common Questions about Life Insurance

Learn the Basics
Get answers to common questions with SBLI’s Life Insurance Basics.



We understand. Life insurance can be intimidating at first. That’s why getting it from SBLI is important. We make the process easy and explain things simply. See for yourself below with our life insurance basics.



What kind of insurance do I need?
Whole or Term Life?

The kind of life insurance you need depends on your unique situation. Term Life insurance may be right if you only need coverage for a specified amount of time–as long as your kids are still at home or while you have a mortgage, for instance. Whole life, with generally higher premiums, fulfills a longer-term insurance need and offers a cash value from which you can borrow for any reason you choose. Many consider purchasing some of both to get the best of both worlds.
Term Life Insurance
Term life protects your beneficiaries for the length of the policy. With SBLI’s guaranteed level premium term life, your premium is guaranteed never to change over that period. You pay your premiums and we agree to pay your family the value of the policy in the case of your death while the policy is in force.

Term length choices of 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years
Very affordable
Payments never change during the entire period you select
Choice of two policy add-ons (“riders”)
Accelerated Death Benefit rider is included at no premium charge

Learn More

Whole Life Insurance
Whole life insurance offers coverage for your entire life. While premiums are generally higher, you can borrow from the policy’s cash value while you’re alive for any reason you choose, including for your kids’ tuition and extra retirement income. SBLI’s whole life products are eligible for dividends as well.

Coverage for life
Premiums never increase
Policy has a guaranteed cash value
Grows tax-advantaged over time
Can borrow against value of policy
Eligible for dividends
Choice of up to 7 policy add-ons (“riders”)
Accelerated Death Benefit rider is included at no premium charge

How Much Is Enough?
When considering how much coverage you need, it is important to keep in mind both your current and future financial obligations.
Consider how much money it would take to replace your annual income, pay the mortgage, and cover car payments and credit debt. Getting the right term life insurance policy can meet these and other needs if you pass away unexpectedly.
You should also consider your financial needs if you do not pass away unexpectedly. For example, you may want a source of supplemental retirement income or additional funds to pay your kids’ tuitions. Whole life insurance can help do that, thanks to its guaranteed cash value from which you can borrow for any reason.
Try our free Coverage Estimator for a personalized term coverage amount.


What does it cost?
Life insurance varies depending on your age, health, gender, and the type of policy you choose. The one thing most policies have in common is that most people overestimate their cost.

Step 5: Policy issued
If your application is approved, we’ll send your policy and a choice of convenient payment options. Your policy will be in effect upon your first premium payment.

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.

The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company: No-Action Letter dated  















Home | Previous Page





























 
No-Action Letter under:Securities Act of 1933 - Rule 145
Investment Company Act - Sections 5, 8 and 11
The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company
December 27, 2001


RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF  
INSURANCE PRODUCTS
 DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
  The Manufacturers
   Life Insurance Company
  (U.S.A.), et al.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 27, 2001, and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) ("ManUSA"), The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of America ("ManAmerica"), or The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of North America ("MNA") under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") if ManAmerica and MNA transfer certain separate accounts ("Separate Accounts") to ManUSA in connection with the proposed reorganization of ManUSA, ManAmerica, and MNA (the "Reorganization").  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if:  (1) the change in depositor for the Separate Accounts as a result of the Reorganization is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Separate Accounts on Form N-4 or Form N-8B-2 under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form S-6 under the 1933 Act are filed by ManUSA and the Separate Accounts to cover any securities issued after the Reorganization in connection with variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts funded by the Separate Accounts. 

Further, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, without registration under the 1933 Act, ManAmerica transfers to ManUSA assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under a fixed annuity option with a market value adjustment provision, and MNA transfers to ManUSA assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under a fixed annuity contract with a market value adjustment provision (collectively, "Registered MVA Contracts"), as a result of which ManUSA would assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of ManAmerica and MNA under the Registered MVA Contracts.

In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against ManUSA or the Separate Accounts if, after consummation of the Reorganization, ManUSA, the Separate Accounts, and other parties named in the exemptive orders and no-action letters cited in your December 27, 2001 letter continue to rely on such orders and no-action letters without filing amended or new applications and no-action letters for the same relief previously granted.1
Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.  Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.  

Kenneth C. Fang
Attorney

1   You have not requested, and we are not providing, any assurances with respect to reliance on the staff no-action position taken in Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company (pub. avail. October 23, 1990) by ManUSA, ManAmerica, or MNA, and the Separate Accounts either prior to or after the Reorganization.

Re: The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.)
  The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of America
  The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of North America
Dear Mr. Kotapish:

  We are writing on behalf of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) ("ManUSA"), The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of America ("ManAmerica") and The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of North America ("MNA"), which propose to combine their operations by having (i) MNA merge into ManUSA and (ii)ManAmerica transfer substantially all its assets and liabilities  to ManUSA (together,  the "Reorganization").  The purpose of this letter is to ask the Staff to advise us that it would not recommend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") take any enforcement action under various sections of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and Rule 145 under the 1933 Act, if, in connection with the Reorganization and in the manner described below, ManAmerica and MNA transfer, intact, each of their separate accounts registered under the 1940 Act (the "Separate Accounts") to ManUSA, with ManUSA succeeding ManAmerica and MNA as co-issuer with their respective Separate Accounts of all the variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts funded by the Separate Accounts (the Contracts") and as depositor of the Separate Accounts (the "Transfer").  As discussed below, those transactions are subject to usual regulatory and stockholder approvals, but the owners of the Contracts (the "Contract Owners") will have no right to opt-out of, vote on or otherwise consent to any of the transactions and therefore will not have any investment decision to make with respect to the Transfer or any other aspect of the Reorganization. 

  ManAmerica has issued one Contract with a fixed annuity option and a market value adjustment provision which it registered under the 1933 Act, File No. 33-57020 (the "ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract").  MNA has issued one fixed annuity contract with a market value adjustment provision which it registered under the 1933 Act, File No. 333-6011 (the "MNA Registered MVA Contract").  As a result of the Reorganization, ManUSA will also succeed to the obligations of ManAmerica and MNA under the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract and the MNA Registered MVA Contract (collectively, the "Registered MVA Contracts").  We are therefore also requesting the Staff to advise us that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, in the manner described below, each of ManAmerica and MNA transfers to ManUSA  assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Registered MVA Contracts, and ManUSA assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of ManAmerica and MNA under the Registered MVA Contracts (the "Fixed Account Transfer").

  E. Separate Accounts and Contracts
ManUSA has registered one separate account under the 1940 Act and one variable life insurance contract under the 1933 Act.3
ManAmerica has four Separate Accounts.4  Separate Account One funds one variable life insurance contract5 as to which ManAmerica is relying on the Staff no-action position taken in Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company (available October 23, 1990)("Great-West"). 6 Separate Account Two funds two variable annuity contracts7 as to both of which ManAmerica is relying on Great-West.  Separate Account Three funds seven variable life insurance contracts8 as to three of which ManAmerica is relying on Great-West.  Separate Account Four funds two variable life insurance contracts9 as to one of which ManAmerica is relying on Great-West.

  MNA has two Separate Accounts.  Separate Account A funds eleven variable annuity contracts.10  Separate Account B funds one variable life insurance contract as to which MNA is relying on Great West.11
Each separate account discussed under this caption is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act and consists of subaccounts each of which invests exclusively in shares of one of the series of MIT (or in the case of certain Contracts funded in MNA Separate Account A in the shares of one of three series of ML Fund).  

  F.  Registered MVA Contracts 
ManAmerica offered the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract only as an investment option under a Contract which it no longer offers and as to which it is currently relying on Great-West.12  ManAmerica holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act. ManAmerica is no longer offering the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract, is not accepting additional purchase payments under outstanding ManAmerica Registered MVA Contracts (or transfers from the Separate Account for the variable portion of the Contract) and is not filing post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract.  At the effective time of the Transfer, ManAmerica will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under these contracts to ManUSA, and ManUSA will enter into an assumption reinsurance arrangement with respect to, and thereby assume ManAmerica's obligations under, the contracts.  ManUSA does not intend to offer additional ManAmerica Registered MVA Contracts, accept additional purchase payments under the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contracts that it reinsures (or accept transfers from the Separate Account for the variable portion of the Contract) or file post-effective amendments to the current 1933 Act registration statement, or a new 1933 Act registration statement, for the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract.

  The MNA Registered MVA Contract is a single purchase payment deferred fixed annuity contract which is offered to individuals and to eligible groups.  It has no variable investment options.  MNA holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the MNA Registered MVA Contract in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  At the effective time of the Transfer, as a result of the merger of MNA into ManUSA, assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under these contracts will be transferred by MNA to ManUSA, and ManUSA will assume MNA's obligations under the contracts.  Sales of the MNA Registered MVA Contract will cease as of the effective time of the Transfer.  

  II.  Proposed Transaction
Manulife Financial conducts insurance and related operations in the United States through more than 15 wholly-owned subsidiaries, including ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA.  It proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs. A major step in this process is to combine the operations of ManAmerica and MNA with those of ManUSA.  To achieve this objective, ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA will effect the Reorganization, i.e., (i) the merger of MNA into ManUSA, and (ii) the transfer of substantially all the assets and liabilities of ManAmerica to ManUSA, in connection with which ManUSA will enter into assumption reinsurance arrangements with respect to the ManAmerica Contracts and the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract.  

  The Reorganization will include, among other things, the Transfer, i.e., a transfer by ManAmerica and MNA of each of their Separate Accounts intact to ManUSA, and the Fixed Account Transfer, i.e., a transfer by ManAmerica and MNA to ManUSA of non-unitized separate account assets intact and of general account assets, together equal to the reserves and other liabilities under the Registered MVA Contracts. ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA anticipate that the Reorganization, including the Transfer and the Fixed Account Transfer, will be effective on January 1, 2002 (the "Effective Date").  They will bear all costs associated with those transactions.

  A. The Transfer
ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA will follow the procedures set forth below in implementing the Transfer.

  Prior to the date of this letter:

 - ManUSA and ManAmerica entered into an agreement for assignment of assets and assumption of liabilities and an assumption reinsurance agreement, each of which was approved by their Boards of Directors.  The Separate Accounts are not parties to these agreements.

    - The combination of ManUSA and ManAmerica, including the assumption reinsurance agreement, received approvals required under applicable state insurance laws, including approval by the Insurance Commissioner of the state of Michigan.

    - ManUSA and MNA entered into a merger agreement that was approved by their Boards of Directors.   The Separate Accounts are not parties to this agreement.

    - The combination of ManUSA and MNA received approvals required under applicable state insurance laws, including approval by the Insurance Commissioners of the states of Michigan and Delaware.

    - ManUSA prepared new registration statements for the Contracts on Forms N-4 and S-6 under the 1933 Act which it will file and request be declared effective in connection with the Transfer. 

On the Effective Date:

- ManUSA will receive all the assets of each Separate Account, which will be maintained intact and not combined with the assets of any other separate account of ManUSA or any other entity in connection with the Transfer, will assume the liabilities and obligations of ManAmerica and MNA under the Contracts13 and will become the depositor for the Separate Accounts and the co-issuer with the Separate Accounts of the Contracts, as a result of which each Separate Account previously maintained by ManAmerica or MNA will become a Separate Account of ManUSA. 

    - Except for the succession of ManUSA to the role of depositor for the Separate Accounts and to the liabilities and obligations arising under the Contracts, the Transfer will not: have any effect on the Separate Accounts;  affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Contracts, including those dealing with withdrawal or surrender rights or charges, death benefits, annuity options, investment options, administrative charges and mortality and expense risk charges; or dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the Contract Owners.

Immediately after the Transfer, and except for ongoing Contract charges and deductions noted in the immediately following paragraph:

- The assets and liabilities of each Separate Account will have been transferred intact from ManAmerica or MNA and will be same as they were immediately prior to the Transfer and will be legally separate from any other business of ManUSA.

    - Each Contract will continue to be funded in the same Separate Account in which it was funded immediately prior to the Transfer.

    - Each Contract Owner's interest will be the same as it was immediately prior to the Transfer, i.e., the respective net asset values per unit of interest in each Separate Account and the values determined under the Contracts will be identical to what they would have been absent the Transfer. 

    - Each Separate Account will continue to maintain its separate status as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act and as a separate account under applicable state law.

    - Each Separate Account will continue to have available for investment all the series of Underlying Funds in which it invested immediately prior to the Transfer.  No existing investment option will have been substituted or terminated by virtue of the Transfer, and the addition of any new investment option will not have been contingent upon the effectiveness of the Transfer. 

    - ManUSA and each Separate Account will file an amendment to the existing registration statement under the 1940 Act of the Separate Account on Form N-4 or Form N-8B-2, as appropriate, to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the Separate Account from ManAmerica or MNA to ManUSA. 

    - The principal underwriter for the Contracts will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manulife.

    -In compliance with applicable state law, ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA will notify Contract Owners that ManUSA has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of ManAmerica or MNA under the Contracts.

Except for charges and deductions that would have been made pursuant to the Contracts in any event in the absence of the Transfer, there will be no charge against or other deduction from the Separate Accounts or the Contracts in connection with the Transfer.   

  After the Transfer, ManUSA intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfer is effected, and to continue offering new Contracts through the Separate Accounts identical to the Contracts being offered on the Transfer Date, but for the change in depositor.  Payments so accepted and new contracts so offered will be covered by the new registration statements to be filed with the Commission under the 1933 Act in connection with the Transfer.  ManUSA will not accept payments under the Contracts, and will not offer identical new Contracts, until the new registration statements filed with the Commission have been declared effective and the Reorganization has become effective.  ManUSA in the future may register other variable contracts to be offered through the Separate Accounts or other separate accounts.

  ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA have determined, based on the nature of the Transfer and related transactions involved in the Reorganization, that no provision of the Contracts or state law provides Contract Owners with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Transfer or any other aspect of the Reorganization. Neither the Transfer nor any other aspect of the Reorganization gives rise to any event affecting any Separate Account that would require a vote of Contract Owners under the 1940 Act. Consequently, Contract Owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Transfer or any other aspect of the Reorganization.

  The Transfer will have no effect on the Underlying Funds.  The Underlying Funds will not be parties to the Transfer or to any related transaction the implementation of which is contingent upon consummation of the Reorganization. Neither the Transfer nor any other aspect of the Reorganization will, with respect to each series of the Underlying Funds in which the Separate Accounts invest, give rise to: a change in investment objectives, policies and restrictions; the addition, substitution, amendment or termination of a series; or a change in investment adviser, subadviser,  assets or charges imposed on the series or its shareholders.  Therefore, there will be no event affecting any of the Underlying Funds or any series of the Underlying Funds in which the Separate Accounts invest that would require a vote of its shareholders under state law or the 1940 Act.

  B. The Fixed Account Transfer
ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA will follow procedures in connection with the transfer of the Registered MVA Contracts that are substantially the same as those set forth above for the Transfer, except for those procedures that reflect requirements of the 1940 Act.  The assumption reinsurance agreements that apply to the Contracts issued by ManAmerica will also apply to the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract.  On the Effective Date, each non-unitized separate account of ManAmerica and MNA will become a non-unitized separate account of ManUSA.  At the same time, ManUSA  will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of ManAmerica and MNA (and, in the case of ManAmerica,  reinsure the Registered MVA Contracts at full value) and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of ManAmerica and MNA under the Registered MVA Contracts which they issued prior to the Transfer. As in the case of the Contracts, ManAmerica will remain contingently liable under the Registered MVA Contracts previously issued by it, subject to indemnities to be determined by negotiation between the parties. The Fixed Account Transfer will not change the terms of the Registered MVA Contracts, except for the succession of ManUSA as the insurer under the Registered MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those contracts.

  In compliance with applicable state law, ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA will notify the owners of the Registered MVA Contracts that ManUSA has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of ManAmerica or MNA under those contracts.

  After the Fixed Account Transfer, ManUSA intends to treat the Registered MVA Contracts as follows.  It will treat the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contracts in the same way that they are currently treated by ManAmerica.  It will not offer the ManAmerica Registered MVA Contract and will not accept additional purchase payments under outstanding ManAmerica Registered MVA Contracts (or transfers from the Separate Account for the variable portion of the Contracts).  It will also treat the MNA Registered MVA Contracts (these are single payment fixed annuity contracts that do not provide for any transfers to or from any of the Separate Accounts) that are outstanding at the effective time of the Transfer in the same way that they are then being treated by MNA. Sales of the MNA Registered MVA Contract will cease as of the Fixed Account Transfer. 

  ManUSA, ManAmerica and MNA have determined, based on the nature of the Fixed Account Transfer and related transactions, that no provision of the Registered MVA Contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Fixed Account Transfer.  Consequently, owners of Registered MVA Contracts will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Fixed Account Transfer.

  III.  Discussion
As discussed more fully below, it is our view that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder and Sections 8 and 11 of the 1940 Act are inapplicable to the Transfer and that the exemptive relief under the 1940 Act granted, and the no-action assurances given, to ManAmerica or MNA and their respective Separate Accounts prior to the Transfer and listed in note 19 may continue to be relied upon after the Transfer by ManUSA and the affected Separate Accounts without the need for the filing of amended or duplicative exemptive applications or no-action requests with the Commission.

  The staff has, in the past, responded favorably to no-action requests dealing with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act noted above for similar transactions.14   The proposed Transfer poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions.15
It is also our view, as discussed below, that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder do not apply to the Fixed Account Transfer.

  A.  Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 Thereunder Are Inapplicable to the Transfer
In our view, the Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act. Each Separate Account after the Transfer will remain intact, and its assets will be legally segregated from all other assets of ManUSA and will not be combined with those of any other account or entity. 

  There will be by virtue of the Transfer no change to the Contracts, except for ManUSA succeeding ManAmerica and MNA as the insurance company co-issuing the Contracts with the Separate Accounts and providing the rights and benefits under the Contracts to Contract Owners.   These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same; each Contract will remain funded by the same pools of assets which constitute the Separate Account in which it was funded immediately prior to the Transfer; and each Separate Account will continue to have available for investment all the series of Underlying Funds in which it invested prior to the Transfer.  

  As discussed above, Contract Owners will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Transfer, have available any new or different investment options.  Consequently, Contract Owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Transfer.  Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 14516 thereunder are inapplicable to the Transfer.17
We believe, however, that registration statements for the Contracts issued through the Separate Accounts, as accounts of ManUSA, need to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover additional payments accepted on Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfer is effected and Contracts issued after that time.  As noted above, in connection with the Transfer, ManUSA and the Separate Accounts will file new registration statements on Forms N-4 and S-6 with the Commission under the 1933 Act and will request that the registration statements be declared effective in connection with the Transfer.  These new registration statements would reflect ManUSA's assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of ManAmerica and MNA with respect to the Contracts pursuant to the Transfer.  After the Transfer, each Contract Owner at the time of the Transfer will receive a prospectus that reflects ManUSA as the co-issuer with a Separate Account of the Contract owned by the Contract Owner and as the depositor of the Separate Account in which the Contract is funded, but which retains the historical financial information of the Separate Account.  (This procedure will be followed both for those Contracts being offered by ManAmerica or MNA at the time of the Transfer and for those Contracts not then being offered for which a 1933 Act  registration statement is not being maintained in reliance on the staff no-action position taken in Great-West.  After the Transfer, ManUSA will follow the procedures set forth in Great-West with respect to these Contracts.)18
B.  Section 11 of the 1940 Act Is Inapplicable to the Transfer
Based on the analysis set forth above relating to Section 5 and the precedents cited in note 14, we also believe that the Transfer would not involve an exchange of securities, namely the Contracts, issued by an investment company for another security of an investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.  However, should the Transfer be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11 of the 1940 Act, we believe that the Transfer will comply with the requirements of Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Thus, Commission approval should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with effecting the Transfer.

  C.  Section 8 of the 1940 Act Is Inapplicable to the Transfer
We believe that the Transfer can, and should, be effected through the amendment of the existing registration statements for the Separate Accounts under the 1940 Act rather than through the filing of  new notifications of registration and registration statements for the Separate Accounts pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.  The change in the depositor of the Separate Accounts caused by the Transfer will not change the structure or operations of the Separate Accounts or a Separate Account's relationship to the insurance company that is the co-issuer with the Separate Account of the Contracts funded in that Separate Account, to any other separate account of that insurance company or to the Contract Owners.

  As indicated above, ManUSA and each Separate Account will file an amendment to the existing registration statement of the Separate Account on Form N-4 or Form N-8B-2 under the 1940 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Separate Account from ManAmerica or MNA to ManUSA as a result of the Transfer. 

  D.  Continuation of Exemptive Relief and No-Action Assurances Previously Granted
We believe that the exemptions under the 1940 Act and no-action assurances listed below19 which the Separate Accounts and ManAmerica or MNA and the other parties named therein have received from the SEC or its staff should continue to be applicable after the Transfer to each such Separate Account and ManUSA and such other parties, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications or no-action requests for the same relief.  Their continued applicability is appropriate because the Transfer will not change either the structure or operations of any Separate Account, nor its relationship to its depositor, any other separate account or Contract Owners.  The only resulting change will be the substitution of ManUSA for ManAmerica or MNA as depositor for each Separate Account and co-issuer with the Separate Account and insurer of the Contracts.  It is our view that such a change has no impact upon, and is not relevant to, the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications offered for those exemptions.

  E. Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 Thereunder Are Inapplicable to the Fixed      Account Transfer
In our view, the Fixed Account Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.  No change will be made to the Registered MVA Contracts, except for ManUSA succeeding ManAmerica and MNA as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Registered MVA Contracts to the owners of those contracts.   These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Each of ManAmerica and MNA will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts which hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Registered MVA Contracts intact to ManUSA in the same manner that it transfers the assets and liabilities of the Separate Accounts.  Consequently, when the Fixed Account Transfer becomes effective, ManUSA will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer. 

  As discussed above, owners of Registered MVA Contracts  will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Fixed Account Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, have available any new or different investment options.  Consequently, owners of Registered MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Fixed Account Transfer.  Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder are inapplicable to the Fixed Account Transfer and that, accordingly,  ManUSA may effect the Fixed Account Transfer without having a 1933 Act registration statement in effect with respect to the MVA Registered Contracts at the time of the transfer.

  ManUSA will not accept any additional purchase payments under (or transfers to) the Registered MVA Contracts outstanding at the effective time of the Fixed Account Transfer.  We believe, therefore, that ManUSA does not need to have registration statements in effect after the Fixed Account Transfer for the Registered MVA Contracts issued by ManAmerica and MNA. 

  IV.  No-Action Request
Based upon the above facts and circumstances, we respectfully request that the Staff advise us  that it will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Transfer or the Fixed Account Transfer or under Sections 8 and 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Transfer if the transactions are effected as described herein.  In addition, we request that the Staff advise us that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if in effecting the Transfer (i) ManUSA and the Separate Accounts filed an amendment to the registration statement for each Separate Account on Form N-4 or Form N-8B-2  under the 1940 Act to effect the change in depositor for each Separate Account from ManAmerica or MNA to ManUSA and (ii) ManUSA filed new registration statements on Forms N-4 and S-6, as appropriate, for the Contracts under the 1933 Act to cover securities transactions which are effected in connection with the Contracts after the effective time of the Transfer and for which an effective 1933 Act registration statement may be required.  We also request the Staff's concurrence in our view that the exemptive orders and no-action letters cited herein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, will continue to be applicable to the Separate Account to which granted, to ManUSA and to the other parties named therein without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions or no-action requests for the same assurance.

  If you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter, please call the undersigned at 202-223-3500.

                Very truly yours,

                Jones & Blouch L.L.P.

              By______________________________
                   John W. Blouch

Footnotes

1  MIT was originally organized as NASL Series Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation, to serve as the underlying fund for the Contracts issued by MNA.  Effective December 31, 1988, NASL Series Fund, Inc. was reorganized as the Massachusetts business trust which is today known as MIT. Effective December 31, 1996, the series of Manulife Series Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation, which since its organization had served as the sole underlying fund for the Contracts issued by ManAmerica, were merged into series of MIT as a result of which MIT became the underlying fund for both ManAmerica and MNA.

2 Manulife has three wholly-owned United States subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the 1934 Act and, independently of the Reorganization, has been considering combining some or all of their operations. Manulife currently expects that effective January 2, 2002 the broker-dealer activities of MSS and ManEquity will be transferred to Manulife Financial Securities LLC ("MFS"), a recently organized Delaware limited liability company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manulife, and that MFS will succeed MSS and ManEquity as the principal underwriter for the Contracts.

6  An indication that ManAmerica or MNA is relying on Great-West with respect to a particular  Contract means that the company has ceased offering that Contract and is following the procedures set forth and relying on the Staff no-action position taken in Great-West.  Contract Owners continue to be entitled to make purchase payments under their Contracts, to make withdrawals from the Separate Account in which the Contract is funded and, except as otherwise noted in this request, to transfer amounts among subaccounts available under the Contract.

14  There is a long line of no-action letters concerning intact transfers of separate accounts effected pursuant to merger transactions. There is also a long line of no-action letters that deal with assumption reinsurance arrangements involving intact transfers of separate accounts effected in connection with transactions that did not involve a merger of two or more insurers. For all practical purposes, these two lines of letters have raised the same issues and resulted in the same no-action assurances.   The letters dealing with intact transfers in connection with mergers include:   AUSA Life Insurance Company, Inc. (pub. avail. Sept. 18, 1998); Pacific Life Insurance Company (pub. avail. Oct. 29, 1997); Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. (pub. avail. Dec. 18, 1996); Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (pub. avail. May 17, 1996); Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., et al.

Apr. 26, 1995); Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Company (pub. avail. Sept. 15, 1995); Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (pub. avail. Oct. 27, 1993); Security First Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Jan. 17, 1992); The Great-West Life Assurance Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 27, 1991); Allegiance Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. July 31, 1990); Mass Life Ins. Co. of New York, et al. (pub. avail.  Nov. 14, 1989); Anchor National Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Nov. 8, 1989); and Provident Mutual Life Ins. Co. of Philadelphia (pub. avail. Feb. 2, 1987) (collectively referred to herein as "assumption reinsurance no-action letters"). See also Hartford Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 31, 1977); Variable Annuity Accounts B & C of Aetna Variable Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 10, 1976); Hartford Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Sept. 1, 1975); and American Variable Annuity Life Assurance Co. (pub. avail. Sept. 6, 1974) which dealt with similar issues in connection with "change in domicile" transactions.

15 The staff provided no-action assurance with respect to Section 17 in the assumption reinsurance no-action letters and in many of the merger no-action letters cited in note 14.  In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 17, 1996) the staff stated that neither Section 17(a) nor Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act is applicable when two insurance companies merge and a separate account is transferred from the merged company to the surviving company if specified conditions are met.  In Metropolitan Life, the staff further stated that it does not intend to issue further no-action letters in this area absent novel facts and circumstances.  ManUSA, MNA and ManAmerica are relying on the position taken in Metropolitan Life with respect to both the merger of MNA into ManUSA and the transfer of substantially all the assets and liabilities of ManAmerica to ManUSA.

16  Rule 145 under the 1933 Act provides, in pertinent part, that certain business combinations, including certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of assets, will be deemed to involve the "offer" or "sale" of securities requiring registration under that Act under circumstances where existing security holders are in effect asked to make an investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for a security they presently own.  The Transfer will not involve a merger or consolidation since the Separate Accounts will be transferred intact from ManAmerica and MNA to ManUSA.  Moreover, even if the Transfer were deemed to be a "transfer of assets" for purposes of Rule 145, it is clear that the Rule does not apply because the Contract Owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction.  For these reasons, we believe that Rule 145 is inapplicable to the Transfer.

17  Our view is not altered by implementation as of the Effective Date of actions taken by the Trustees of MIT and by its shareholders on December 19, 2001 to approve the creation of a multi- class structure, the adoption of 12b-1 plans and amendments to the Advisory Agreement between MIT and MSS.  These are not events of the type covered by Rule 145 which, as discussed in note 16, applies to votes solicited in connection with certain business combinations involving the issuance of new securities.  The Staff has granted no-action relief under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder under circumstances in which shareholder approval of new investment advisory agreements was solicited prior to the effectiveness of the transfers of separate accounts. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (pub. avail. May 17, 1996) and Voyager Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Jan. 10, 1986) (shareholder approval also solicited with respect to the election of directors and ratification of accountants).  Moreover, while in each of these letters the implementation of new advisory agreements was contingent upon the effectiveness of the transfers of separate accounts, all the MIT actions will be implemented whether or not the Reorganization is consummated.  Because these actions are being taken independently of, and their implementation is not contingent upon, the Transfer, their implementation as of, rather than prior to, the Effective Date does not alter our view that the Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of a new or different security.

18   We are not requesting any no-action assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by ManAmerica, MNA and ManUSA on Great-West.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

DISCOVERING HIDDEN VALUE

Life settlements have changed the way we think about life insurance. For consumers, life settlements have unlocked the market value of life insurance, transforming unneeded policies into assets with significant value. For advisors, life settlements open a host of new strategies for strengthening portfolios and building client relationships.
One Transaction. Multiple Applications.
There are a variety of situations which may lead someone to reevaluate their life insurance needs, including:

Long term care funding – a policyowner who needs assistance funding long term care can sell their life insurance and use the proceeds to help offset the cost.
Recouping term premiums – a policyowner who no longer needs their convertible term policy can use a life settlement to eliminate future premiums and recoup a portion of their overall premium outlay.
Restructuring cash flow – a policyowner with limited cash flow can use the proceeds from a life settlement to fund a reduced policy with lower premiums.
A need to eliminate premiums and retain a portion of coverage – a policyowner may find they need to retain a certain level of coverage. Through a life settlement, a policyowner can keep a portion of their coverage while eliminating future premium obligations, in lieu of a cash payment.

We make the process simple. Basic information about the policy and the insured’s health is submitted to Coventry. Upon review, the policyowner will receive an offer from Coventry First either in the form of a cash payment or the amount of death benefit they can retain with no future premium obligations.
To learn more about life settlements call 877.836.8300.

Case Studies A 79 year-old male owned a universal life policy with a face amount of $1.5 million. Originally purchased for estate preservation, the policyowner could no longer afford premium payments on the policy. Rather than allowing the policy to lapse, his advisor suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First provided the policyowner with $196,000 for a policy that otherwise had no cash surrender value, which he used for immediate retirement expenses and supplementary income.The 73 year-old policyowner and his spouse originally purchased a $3 million survivorship universal life policy 14 years prior for estate preservation. A couple of years after his wife passed away, he approached his advisor because he no longer needed the coverage and could not afford premium payments. Rather than allowing the policy to lapse – since it had no cash value – his advisor suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First provided the policyowner with $270,000, which he used for supplementary retirement income.Thirteen years earlier, a businessman purchased three policies with a total face value of $12 million for estate planning purposes. With total annual premium payments projected at over $206,000, he arranged for his business to fund the premiums for two of the policies as part of a split dollar agreement. Now, facing a downturn in his business, along with current total annual premiums of more than $290,000, the policyowner decided he no longer wanted to keep the policies in force. He needed to repay his business just over $1 million for accumulated annual premium payments, while the policies' cash surrender value was $962,400. He contacted his advisor who suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First paid the policyowner $1,271,000 for the three policies, which was more than enough to repay the accumulated annual premiums owed.

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?
                            

As one of the oldest and largest mutual life insurance companies in the United States, New York Life has been protecting generations of families for more than 170 years. New York Life has the highest possible ratings for financial strength currently awarded to any life insurer from the leading independent rating services: A.M. Best (A++) Highest Rating, Fitch (AAA)Highest Rating, Standard & Poor’s (AA+) Second-Highest Rating, Moody’s Investors Service(Aaa) Highest Rating. Ratings as of 5/01/17.




	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?
                            



Yes. New York Life offers a range of coverage amounts and solutions to fit your individual life insurance needs.

Through the multiple lead filters we are able to better target the type of customers we want, which has led to more homes closed as well as a better retention rate for leads closed through HTQ  Not to mention, I have been extremely impressed with the knowledge of my Regional Director and helpfulness of each person I have spoken with at Hometown Quotes.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
