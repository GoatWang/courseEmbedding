Information about Paragon Offshore plc’s Completed Financial Restructuring



Attention: On July 18, 2017, Paragon Offshore plc (“OldCo”) emerged from U.S. Bankruptcy reorganization (the “Effective Date”).  As part of the restructuring, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of OldCo and certain other assets of OldCo and/or certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (which together constitute the ongoing operational business of the Paragon Offshore group) were transferred directly or indirectly to Paragon Offshore Limited, a newly formed Cayman Islands company (“Paragon Offshore”). 
OldCo will continue to exist as a separate entity subsequent to the Effective Date and its shares were not cancelled on the Effective Date; therefore, OldCo’s shares may continue to trade on over-the-counter markets. At this time, shares of Paragon Offshore are not traded on any market. 
Please note that OldCo and Paragon Offshore are two separate and distinct entities and any shares you may see traded of OldCo DO NOT represent the equity of the reorganized Paragon Offshore nor any right to receive any equity or other interest in (or property of) Paragon Offshore.

PARAGON OFFSHORE PLC Company Profile


   Paragon Offshore hopes to be a paragon of standard-specification offshore drilling. It operates a fleet of 41 Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs), and one Floating Production, Storage and Offtake (FPSO) vessel, and also conducts contract labor operations on the Hibernia Platform in offshore eastern Canada. Paragon Offshore provides drilling services to more than 17 customers in 12 countries on five continents. Its clients include PETROBRAS, Pemex, ONGC, Exxon Mobil, TOTAL, Centrica, and Wintershall. The company was formed in 2014 when offshore driller Noble Corp. spun off its standard-specification shallow-water, mid-water, and deep-water assets as Paragon Offshore.
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017.
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.

PARAGON OFFSHORE PLC Revenue and Financial Data


   Paragon Offshore hopes to be a paragon of standard-specification offshore drilling. It operates a fleet of 41 Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs), and one Floating Production, Storage and Offtake (FPSO) vessel, and also conducts contract labor operations on the Hibernia Platform in offshore eastern Canada. Paragon Offshore provides drilling services to more than 17 customers in 12 countries on five continents. Its clients include PETROBRAS, Pemex, ONGC, Exxon Mobil, TOTAL, Centrica, and Wintershall. The company was formed in 2014 when offshore driller Noble Corp. spun off its standard-specification shallow-water, mid-water, and deep-water assets as Paragon Offshore.
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017.

The articles of incorporation are drafted according to legal statute. The documents are filed with the jurisdiction government office by a licensed company, as required by law, such as OffshoreCompany.com and associates. Then, initial offshore company formation documents and registration certificates, as well as a declaration location of a registered agent within the incorporating jurisdiction, are filed with the appropriate agencies. The exact requirements of forming offshore companies varies from each jurisdiction. Regardless of your jurisdiction, OffshoreCompany.com will complete all of your paperwork, file your documents, set up your registered agent and facilitate the entire offshore incorporation process for you.
