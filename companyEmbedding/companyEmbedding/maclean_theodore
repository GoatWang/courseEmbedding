Boston Business Journal







 



 






 



It’s surprising how much you can learn about Microsoft Corp.’s top dog in New England from his Facebook profile.
In just a few moments anyone subscribed to the service and living in the Boston area can discover that he was born in Chicago, is of Scottish and Greek descent and enjoys skiing and watching the Red Sox with his family. He also recently watched the animated film “Wall-E.”




 


While opening oneself so widely in an online environment is rare among Boston’s most powerful businessmen, Ted MacLean says having a digital identity is crucial for understanding how he and his employer, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), can meet the needs of a changing technological world.
“As someone who works at a technology company with innovation as its strength, I need to be aware of trends and how those trends are applied,” he said. “There’s so much out there. ... I listen to what my customers are trying to do and figure out of all those things that might have some applicability to businesses.”





MacLean, 43, readily admits that he is not a software architect or lifelong technologist — he majored in history at Carleton College and received an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles. He says his real passion is for how technology is used to solve problems at home or in business, adding that “the magic of software” can go a long way to help find new answers to old and new struggles.
That problem-solving ability is valued by Microsoft, a technology behemoth that is constantly challenged by other industry giants such as Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG). To boost its local research and development operations, Microsoft has raided the Greater Boston academic and startup community.
During MacLean’s three years at the helm of Microsoft’s New England operations, its presence has mushroomed from a 225-person office focused on sales and customer support to nearly 950 people focused on product development and research. The company has acquired a handful of local startups, from Beverly’s Groove Networks to, most recently, Needham enterprise search firm FAST Search and Transfer. MacLean also oversees Microsoft’s first East Cost R&D lab in Cambridge’s Kendall Square.

“Google, Apple and Salesforce (Salesforce.com) actually make us play a better game,” he said. “Our ability to compete is completely dependent on our ability to attract and retain talented computer science, sales and marketing and other individuals. We are in Cambridge for a very specific reason: We want to be close to MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and the research going on there. We want to be a part of that environment.”
He takes the competition seriously and maintains a loyalty to the Microsoft brand in both his personal and professional lives.




 


When quizzed about his choice of mobile phone­ — the traditional corporate Blackberry does not use Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system­ — he showed a reporter a Motorola Q 3G phone with Windows Mobile. He uses neither Apple iPods nor Google anything and sticks with his company’s digital music player and search engine, even though many tech experts find Microsoft’s offerings inferior.
The general manager is also committed to developing key relationships with area companies, an area of business development that MacLean knows well.
After marrying his wife, who was a founding partner of software firm Calypso Systems Inc., he left his consulting job at A.T. Kearney Inc. to become Calypso’s president and CEO in 1999. When the company looked to improve its relationship with Microsoft, he took a chance and sent an e-mail to Steve Ballmer, now Microsoft’s CEO.
“I reached out to Steve and said, ‘We’re doing all this great stuff on your platform, but you’re not helping us try and solve some problems.’ I didn’t know him at the time,” MacLean said.
Ballmer e-mailed him back, offering him a chance to meet at Microsoft’s Redmond, Wash., headquarters. He thought he would get 15 minutes with the executive; he spent two hours there strategizing.
Calypso was broken up and sold off to a variety of tech buyers, including Microsoft, in 2002. MacLean stayed on with the software giant.
Part of MacLean’s mandate when coming to Waltham in March 2005 was to take the pulse of the region’s technological needs and communicate them back into the company’s product-development teams. But first he had to make those businesses aware that Microsoft was even around.
“When I first came here I’d frequently get the feedback, ‘I didn’t know Microsoft was here,” he said, noting the firm has been in the Boston area for two decades.
“Part of the challenge personally is to actually participate in the local economy and local community. The more that people see that our presence here is deep, then people will see over the fact that our headquarters isn’t here.”
The business community has seemed to embrace Microsoft’s efforts to grow its role, either through supporting science and technology education programs or through playing influential roles in groups like the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce or the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.
“He’s given not only leadership but visibility and outreach to Microsoft more than his predecessors,” said Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce CEO Paul Guzzi.
