History[edit]
Zhang Lei founded Hillhouse Capital Group in June 2005.[6] The company is named after an avenue in New Haven, one block from where the Yale investment office was previously located.[7] Zhang used an initial $20 million, which he received from Yale through David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, to begin Hillhouse. An additional $10 million soon followed.[1]
According to the Financial Times, Zhang built Hillhouse by being one of the first investment firms to back mainland China’s burgeoning internet sector, including investing in Tencent Holdings Ltd., which is one of China’s most valuable internet companies today. Hillhouse was also one of the first firms to invest in JD.com, the e-commerce giant.[1]
Performance[edit]
Hillhouse has achieved investment returns of up to 52% annualized from inception until 2012, even in spite of a 37% drop in 2008, making Hillhouse among the most profitable funds of its size in the world, and the leading fund in Asia[3][8][9] In 2014, returns had reportedly dropped to over 40%.[10] Owing to its low profile but high performance, founder Zhang Lei and Hillhouse have been likened to Stephen Mandel and Lone Pine Capital.[3]
Notable investments[edit]
Tencent Holdings Ltd: Some of the original $20 million provided from Yale was invested in Tencent Holidings in 2005. It was Hillhouse’s earliest investment and one of their most profitable.[4]
JD.com: Hillhouse was also an early investor in JD.com. At the time of the listing of JD.com on NASDAQ in May 2014, the company was valued at $26 billion. Hillhouse’s original $255 million investment was, at the time of the IPO, valued at $3.9 billion.[11]
Blue Moon: Hillhouse invested in Blue Moon, a liquid detergent maker, in 2010 as its only outside institutional investor. In 2013, Blue Moon was ranked #1 in the China Brand Power Index published by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The market share of its liquid detergent has been ranked #1 in China for the past five consecutive years.[12]
Joint ventures[edit]
Hillhouse established an exclusive joint venture focused on China with the US healthcare provider, Mayo Clinic. Hillhouse will work with the Mayo organization to expand its influence in China. Hillhouse and Mayo celebrated the establishment of this joint venture in January 2015 with a healthcare conference in Beijing, where healthcare industry CEOs, regulators, and academics participated in a discussion about the future of healthcare in China.[13]
Investment philosophy[edit]
Henny Sender discussed Zhang’s investment philosophy in an article published in the Financial Times.[1] According to Sender, “Zhang sees himself as the product of both east and west.” Hillhouse does deep and fundamental research on industries and business models, and applies the value investing philosophy in local contexts while investing in different geographies.
According to Sender, Zhang often brings together leaders of private companies (particularly portfolio companies) for informal discussions. He believes it is beneficial for executives to learn from one another. When leaders of JD.com met with leaders from a hypermarket company, Zhang said, “Etailers learn how offline companies think, and retailers learn how ecommerce companies think.”[1]
Zhang also believes that China’s business model is better suited to emerging markets and is therefore bringing that model to developing nations in Asia. In Indonesia Hillhouse launched a joint venture between mobile messaging platform WeChat and Indonesia’s giant communications and media conglomerate Global Mediacom. “Indonesia is now like China some years ago,” commented Zhang.[14]
Sender also explains that Zhang’s investment philosophy is comparable to that of Warren Buffett, which is to buy and hold. “In a world of speculators, Zhang’s philosophy stands out.”[1][15]
Insider Monkey pointed out that some of Hillhouse’s investment decisions could be classified as contrarian, although they do maintain a considerable number of mainstream investments as well.[16]
Notable investors[edit]
Under a plan reported in August 2015 for Stanford University to invest about $200 million with Hillhouse, the group will be "investing money for at least six of the 10 wealthiest universities in the U.S."[17]

Chinese Consortium Plans To Acquire GLP
Jul 3 17
Global Logistic Properties Limited (SGX:MC0) received bids from a Chinese consortium consisting of Hillhouse Capital Management, Ltd. and Hope Investments. Another consortium led by Warburg Pincus has also submitted round 2 bidding letters for the company. The deal is likely to be the largest acquisition in Asia. 


Aviva Plc, Hillhouse Capital and Tencent Holdings Limited Agree to Develop Insurance Company in Hong Kong
Jan 20 17
Aviva plc, Hillhouse Capital and Tencent Holdings Limited have agreed to develop an insurance company in Hong Kong, which will focus on digital insurance. As part of the agreement, Hillhouse and Tencent will acquire shares in Aviva Life Insurance Company Limited. Following completion of the transaction, Aviva and Hillhouse will each hold 40% and Tencent will hold 20% shareholdings in Aviva Hong Kong. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. As part of the transaction, the shareholders' agreement between the parties contains options which may require Aviva to purchase or dispose of its shareholding in certain circumstances.


Global Logistic Properties Undertakes Strategic Review
Dec 2 16
Global Logistic Properties Limited (SGX:MC0) is undertaking a strategic review of options available to enhance shareholder value, following a request from its largest shareholder GIC Pte. Ltd. It has appointed JP Morgan (SEA) Limited as its financial advisor and constituted a special committee, consisting of four independent directors, to oversee the strategic review. "As part of the strategic review, Global Logistic Properties through JPMorgan is in the process of making preliminary approaches to various parties to evaluate the viability of options available for its business," Global Logistic Properties said. But it added that there is no assurance that any transaction will materialise from the strategic review and the company will make an appropriate announcement in the event of any material developments. Its clarification filing followed a Bloomberg article the same day, which reported that  GLP is working with JPMorgan to review strategic options after drawing unsolicited interest from an investor group including China Investment Corporation; Hillhouse Capital Management, Ltd.; HOPU Jinghua (Beijing) Investment Consultancy Co., Ltd. But GLP made no mention of this unsolicited interest in its clarification announcement. When contacted by Business Times, a GLP spokeswoman declined to comment.

History[edit]
Zhang Lei founded Hillhouse Capital Group in June 2005.[6] The company is named after an avenue in New Haven, one block from where the Yale investment office was previously located.[7] Zhang used an initial $20 million, which he received from Yale through David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, to begin Hillhouse. An additional $10 million soon followed.[1]
According to the Financial Times, Zhang built Hillhouse by being one of the first investment firms to back mainland China’s burgeoning internet sector, including investing in Tencent Holdings Ltd., which is one of China’s most valuable internet companies today. Hillhouse was also one of the first firms to invest in JD.com, the e-commerce giant.[1]
Performance[edit]
Hillhouse has achieved investment returns of up to 52% annualized from inception until 2012, even in spite of a 37% drop in 2008, making Hillhouse among the most profitable funds of its size in the world, and the leading fund in Asia[3][8][9] In 2014, returns had reportedly dropped to over 40%.[10] Owing to its low profile but high performance, founder Zhang Lei and Hillhouse have been likened to Stephen Mandel and Lone Pine Capital.[3]
Notable investments[edit]
Tencent Holdings Ltd: Some of the original $20 million provided from Yale was invested in Tencent Holidings in 2005. It was Hillhouse’s earliest investment and one of their most profitable.[4]
JD.com: Hillhouse was also an early investor in JD.com. At the time of the listing of JD.com on NASDAQ in May 2014, the company was valued at $26 billion. Hillhouse’s original $255 million investment was, at the time of the IPO, valued at $3.9 billion.[11]
Blue Moon: Hillhouse invested in Blue Moon, a liquid detergent maker, in 2010 as its only outside institutional investor. In 2013, Blue Moon was ranked #1 in the China Brand Power Index published by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The market share of its liquid detergent has been ranked #1 in China for the past five consecutive years.[12]
Joint ventures[edit]
Hillhouse established an exclusive joint venture focused on China with the US healthcare provider, Mayo Clinic. Hillhouse will work with the Mayo organization to expand its influence in China. Hillhouse and Mayo celebrated the establishment of this joint venture in January 2015 with a healthcare conference in Beijing, where healthcare industry CEOs, regulators, and academics participated in a discussion about the future of healthcare in China.[13]
Investment philosophy[edit]
Henny Sender discussed Zhang’s investment philosophy in an article published in the Financial Times.[1] According to Sender, “Zhang sees himself as the product of both east and west.” Hillhouse does deep and fundamental research on industries and business models, and applies the value investing philosophy in local contexts while investing in different geographies.
According to Sender, Zhang often brings together leaders of private companies (particularly portfolio companies) for informal discussions. He believes it is beneficial for executives to learn from one another. When leaders of JD.com met with leaders from a hypermarket company, Zhang said, “Etailers learn how offline companies think, and retailers learn how ecommerce companies think.”[1]
Zhang also believes that China’s business model is better suited to emerging markets and is therefore bringing that model to developing nations in Asia. In Indonesia Hillhouse launched a joint venture between mobile messaging platform WeChat and Indonesia’s giant communications and media conglomerate Global Mediacom. “Indonesia is now like China some years ago,” commented Zhang.[14]
Sender also explains that Zhang’s investment philosophy is comparable to that of Warren Buffett, which is to buy and hold. “In a world of speculators, Zhang’s philosophy stands out.”[1][15]
Insider Monkey pointed out that some of Hillhouse’s investment decisions could be classified as contrarian, although they do maintain a considerable number of mainstream investments as well.[16]
Notable investors[edit]
Under a plan reported in August 2015 for Stanford University to invest about $200 million with Hillhouse, the group will be "investing money for at least six of the 10 wealthiest universities in the U.S."[17]

History[edit]
Zhang Lei founded Hillhouse Capital Group in June 2005.[6] The company is named after an avenue in New Haven, one block from where the Yale investment office was previously located.[7] Zhang used an initial $20 million, which he received from Yale through David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, to begin Hillhouse. An additional $10 million soon followed.[1]
According to the Financial Times, Zhang built Hillhouse by being one of the first investment firms to back mainland China’s burgeoning internet sector, including investing in Tencent Holdings Ltd., which is one of China’s most valuable internet companies today. Hillhouse was also one of the first firms to invest in JD.com, the e-commerce giant.[1]
Performance[edit]
Hillhouse has achieved investment returns of up to 52% annualized from inception until 2012, even in spite of a 37% drop in 2008, making Hillhouse among the most profitable funds of its size in the world, and the leading fund in Asia[3][8][9] In 2014, returns had reportedly dropped to over 40%.[10] Owing to its low profile but high performance, founder Zhang Lei and Hillhouse have been likened to Stephen Mandel and Lone Pine Capital.[3]
Notable investments[edit]
Tencent Holdings Ltd: Some of the original $20 million provided from Yale was invested in Tencent Holidings in 2005. It was Hillhouse’s earliest investment and one of their most profitable.[4]
JD.com: Hillhouse was also an early investor in JD.com. At the time of the listing of JD.com on NASDAQ in May 2014, the company was valued at $26 billion. Hillhouse’s original $255 million investment was, at the time of the IPO, valued at $3.9 billion.[11]
Blue Moon: Hillhouse invested in Blue Moon, a liquid detergent maker, in 2010 as its only outside institutional investor. In 2013, Blue Moon was ranked #1 in the China Brand Power Index published by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The market share of its liquid detergent has been ranked #1 in China for the past five consecutive years.[12]
Joint ventures[edit]
Hillhouse established an exclusive joint venture focused on China with the US healthcare provider, Mayo Clinic. Hillhouse will work with the Mayo organization to expand its influence in China. Hillhouse and Mayo celebrated the establishment of this joint venture in January 2015 with a healthcare conference in Beijing, where healthcare industry CEOs, regulators, and academics participated in a discussion about the future of healthcare in China.[13]
Investment philosophy[edit]
Henny Sender discussed Zhang’s investment philosophy in an article published in the Financial Times.[1] According to Sender, “Zhang sees himself as the product of both east and west.” Hillhouse does deep and fundamental research on industries and business models, and applies the value investing philosophy in local contexts while investing in different geographies.
According to Sender, Zhang often brings together leaders of private companies (particularly portfolio companies) for informal discussions. He believes it is beneficial for executives to learn from one another. When leaders of JD.com met with leaders from a hypermarket company, Zhang said, “Etailers learn how offline companies think, and retailers learn how ecommerce companies think.”[1]
Zhang also believes that China’s business model is better suited to emerging markets and is therefore bringing that model to developing nations in Asia. In Indonesia Hillhouse launched a joint venture between mobile messaging platform WeChat and Indonesia’s giant communications and media conglomerate Global Mediacom. “Indonesia is now like China some years ago,” commented Zhang.[14]
Sender also explains that Zhang’s investment philosophy is comparable to that of Warren Buffett, which is to buy and hold. “In a world of speculators, Zhang’s philosophy stands out.”[1][15]
Insider Monkey pointed out that some of Hillhouse’s investment decisions could be classified as contrarian, although they do maintain a considerable number of mainstream investments as well.[16]
Notable investors[edit]
Under a plan reported in August 2015 for Stanford University to invest about $200 million with Hillhouse, the group will be "investing money for at least six of the 10 wealthiest universities in the U.S."[17]

History[edit]
Zhang Lei founded Hillhouse Capital Group in June 2005.[6] The company is named after an avenue in New Haven, one block from where the Yale investment office was previously located.[7] Zhang used an initial $20 million, which he received from Yale through David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, to begin Hillhouse. An additional $10 million soon followed.[1]
According to the Financial Times, Zhang built Hillhouse by being one of the first investment firms to back mainland China’s burgeoning internet sector, including investing in Tencent Holdings Ltd., which is one of China’s most valuable internet companies today. Hillhouse was also one of the first firms to invest in JD.com, the e-commerce giant.[1]
Performance[edit]
Hillhouse has achieved investment returns of up to 52% annualized from inception until 2012, even in spite of a 37% drop in 2008, making Hillhouse among the most profitable funds of its size in the world, and the leading fund in Asia[3][8][9] In 2014, returns had reportedly dropped to over 40%.[10] Owing to its low profile but high performance, founder Zhang Lei and Hillhouse have been likened to Stephen Mandel and Lone Pine Capital.[3]
Notable investments[edit]
Tencent Holdings Ltd: Some of the original $20 million provided from Yale was invested in Tencent Holidings in 2005. It was Hillhouse’s earliest investment and one of their most profitable.[4]
JD.com: Hillhouse was also an early investor in JD.com. At the time of the listing of JD.com on NASDAQ in May 2014, the company was valued at $26 billion. Hillhouse’s original $255 million investment was, at the time of the IPO, valued at $3.9 billion.[11]
Blue Moon: Hillhouse invested in Blue Moon, a liquid detergent maker, in 2010 as its only outside institutional investor. In 2013, Blue Moon was ranked #1 in the China Brand Power Index published by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The market share of its liquid detergent has been ranked #1 in China for the past five consecutive years.[12]
Joint ventures[edit]
Hillhouse established an exclusive joint venture focused on China with the US healthcare provider, Mayo Clinic. Hillhouse will work with the Mayo organization to expand its influence in China. Hillhouse and Mayo celebrated the establishment of this joint venture in January 2015 with a healthcare conference in Beijing, where healthcare industry CEOs, regulators, and academics participated in a discussion about the future of healthcare in China.[13]
Investment philosophy[edit]
Henny Sender discussed Zhang’s investment philosophy in an article published in the Financial Times.[1] According to Sender, “Zhang sees himself as the product of both east and west.” Hillhouse does deep and fundamental research on industries and business models, and applies the value investing philosophy in local contexts while investing in different geographies.
According to Sender, Zhang often brings together leaders of private companies (particularly portfolio companies) for informal discussions. He believes it is beneficial for executives to learn from one another. When leaders of JD.com met with leaders from a hypermarket company, Zhang said, “Etailers learn how offline companies think, and retailers learn how ecommerce companies think.”[1]
Zhang also believes that China’s business model is better suited to emerging markets and is therefore bringing that model to developing nations in Asia. In Indonesia Hillhouse launched a joint venture between mobile messaging platform WeChat and Indonesia’s giant communications and media conglomerate Global Mediacom. “Indonesia is now like China some years ago,” commented Zhang.[14]
Sender also explains that Zhang’s investment philosophy is comparable to that of Warren Buffett, which is to buy and hold. “In a world of speculators, Zhang’s philosophy stands out.”[1][15]
Insider Monkey pointed out that some of Hillhouse’s investment decisions could be classified as contrarian, although they do maintain a considerable number of mainstream investments as well.[16]
Notable investors[edit]
Under a plan reported in August 2015 for Stanford University to invest about $200 million with Hillhouse, the group will be "investing money for at least six of the 10 wealthiest universities in the U.S."[17]
