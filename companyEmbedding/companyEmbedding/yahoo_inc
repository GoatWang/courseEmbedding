Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.
Products and services

Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a "universal profile" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.[77]
Content
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a "universal profile" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.[77]
Content
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]

Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users.

Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Marissa Mayer (2012–2017)[162]
Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)
Scott Thompson (2012)
Tim Morse Interim (2011–2012)
Carol Bartz (2009–2011)
Jerry Yang (2007–2009)
Terry Semel (2001–2007)
Timothy Koogle (1995–2001)

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect

Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo.

Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]

Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a "universal profile" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.[77]
Content
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]

Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Marissa Mayer (2012–2017)[162]
Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)
Scott Thompson (2012)
Tim Morse Interim (2011–2012)
Carol Bartz (2009–2011)
Jerry Yang (2007–2009)
Terry Semel (2001–2007)
Timothy Koogle (1995–2001)

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect

Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo.

Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

This analysis occurs on all communications content as it is sent, received, and when it is stored, including communications content from services synced with your Yahoo account. For certain use cases, Yahoo runs automated algorithms on commercial communications to create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to identify the elements of an airline receipt). These templates do not include the recipient’s personal data. Yahoo template editors may review the templates to improve our services and our personalization of your experience.
    
Please read our  FAQ  to learn more.
This information may also be used for interest-based advertising. To learn more, you can visit Yahoo’s control tool for interest-based advertising.
Yahoo may share keywords, package tracking and product identification numbers with third parties in order to enhance your user experience and provide targeted ads.


Yahoo Mail may include interactive mail features from 3rd parties as well. Your personally identifiable information is not directly shared with the 3rd party without your consent.
In some cases, we may analyze and collect information about photos and other content you upload to Yahoo Mail.  For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information. This information allows us to improve our services and provide additional features and functionality.

Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger now share a common search platform. You may now elect to archive Yahoo instant messages along with Yahoo Mail messages and search them together (including Voice Mail, SMS, and more).
Messages stored on Yahoo servers in this manner are accessible from any computer system or device able to access Yahoo Mail or the latest versions of Yahoo Messenger.

Yahoo Groups











Yahoo Groups offers communications and community tools, including email discussion & newsletter lists, a message archive, chat rooms, file sharing, and photo albums, which allow you to post or display personally identifiable information about yourself. To create a Yahoo Group or take advantage of web-based features of Yahoo Groups, you must be a registered Yahoo user. To join and take part in an email discussion, you do not need to register for a Yahoo account.
Information Collection and Use Practices

You can join or create a Yahoo Group using your Yahoo ID or an alias.
You need to give a valid email address to use Yahoo Groups.
If you are only a member of a group's email list and do not have a Yahoo account, we will not send you marketing messages. Receiving marketing messages from Yahoo is predicated on you registering for a Yahoo account.
Yahoo Groups uses an invisible pixel, sometimes called a web beacon, in HTML email messages to measure activity levels. Yahoo may use this information to further refine our service and the advertising we display.

Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices

Messages you email to the group or that you post through the web site for a Group will always include your email address.
    
Full headers of all email postings can be seen by anyone accessing the messages through the web site.


Your full email address will be visible to the owner and moderator(s) of any Group to which you belong.
    
Some Group owners, though, may choose to give members the option to not allow their email addresses to be visible to owner and moderators. Choosing this option may limit your ability to post and take advantage of other features of the Group.


In using Yahoo Groups and its various tools, you may make some of your personal information public. You may also choose to share some of your personal information with other Group members.
When you share files, post messages, create polls, or add bookmarks to a Group to which you belong, your name, alias and truncated email address will appear next to the file, message, poll or bookmark on the Groups website.
The personal email address of Group owners and moderators who invite members to join the Group via the "invite" tool are visible to the recipients of an invitation.
Certain information from your Yahoo Profile may be visible to others such as your name, gender, city, online status and other information that you have chosen to make public.
If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Practices Regarding Your Ability to Update or Delete Information

If you are a Group owner, you can edit or delete any posting or member in your Group. You can also completely delete your Group at any time. Group owners can also grant moderators the ability to edit or delete postings and members from the Group.
As a Group member, you can edit your Group memberships and preferences at any time. You can also delete your own messages from a Group.

Other

Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to the Yahoo Terms of Service and  Community Guidelines.
Please see Yahoo Groups Help if you have questions about this service.

This module details our privacy practices for versions of Yahoo Messenger released on or after December 3, 2015. For additional information on how Yahoo treats your personal information, please visit our Privacy Policy.
Note: Versions of Yahoo Messenger released prior to December 3, 2015 are no longer supported, however you may review the privacy module here. Please upgrade to the new Yahoo Messenger.
Information Collection & Use Practices

We collect information about you when you use Yahoo Messenger. We collect information from you directly, such as your phone number, email address, photos, and, with your consent, device contacts. We also collect information from you automatically when you use Yahoo Messenger, such as your IP address, location, analytics on app usage, device ID and type, and mobile carrier.
We use the information collected to provide our products and services to you, communicate with you, and operate and improve our products. For example, we use your information to create an account for you and to enable you to search for, connect to, and communicate with other Yahoo Messenger users (and vice versa).
When using Yahoo Messenger, your communications content is stored on our servers and may be made searchable for you through our platforms.


Yahoo’s automated systems analyze all communications content (such as Mail and Messenger content including instant messages and SMS messages) to, without limitation, provide personally relevant product features and content, to match and serve targeted advertising and for spam and malware detection and abuse protection. This analysis occurs on all communications content as it is sent, received, and when it is stored, including communications content from services synced with your Yahoo account.
    
Please read our FAQ to learn more.
This information may also be used for interest-based advertising. You may opt-out of Yahoo’s automated scanning for commercial purposes, as well as our interest-based advertising, through our Ad Interest Manager.



Information Sharing & Disclosure Practices

When you communicate using Yahoo Messenger, we facilitate sharing communications with your friends.
To make it easier for you to locate and communicate with other Yahoo Messenger users, we may, with your consent, synchronize data from your devices. We do this to help you get the most out of Yahoo’s services and enhance your online experience, for example, to help you manage your contacts individually or in groups, de-duplicate contacts, or suggest contacts to message.
Other users who have your phone number or email address stored as a contact on their device will be able to discover you on Yahoo Messenger and see your Messenger name and photo.
You can invite your friends to join Yahoo Messenger, and 1-on-1 and group conversations. Invitations may include message content, such as your name and photos.

Unsending Messages, Photos & GIFs

In many cases you can unsend communications content (however, we may retain copies and logs for audit and record purposes or as required by law).
There are some exceptions to the unsend feature, for example:
    
Users who receive your messages, or any other content, can save or copy them, including taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capturing methods or technology. Also, if users save or copy content (including photos) before it is unsent, they may be able to access and share that content later;
Push notifications of new messages aren’t taken back, so users may be able to read notification snippets of unsent messages;
A message cannot be unsent if a friend is still using a prior version of Yahoo Messenger or goes offline before you can unsend;
Please review the interoperability and unsend Help pages to learn more.


Think before you share! Messages are sent immediately. There's no guarantee the recipients won't see the message before you unsend it.

Other

Some features available in Yahoo Messenger, such as the “like” and unsend features, may not function when communicating with friends using prior versions of Yahoo Messenger (versions released prior to December 3, 2015).
Please see Yahoo Messenger Help pages if you have additional questions about this product.

Yahoo Inc. Earnings Fall Following Big Investments in Search, Product Development
Mobile and search shows signs of promise, but big spending on traffic acquisition takes an unexpected toll.











                Tim Beyers
            

                (TMFMileHigh)



            
            Apr 21, 2015 at 5:19PM

Shares of Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) stock had fallen 1.44% as of 4:29 p.m. ET Tuesday evening, as investors jeered first-quarter results that came short of expectations. Here's a closer look at the final totals versus Wall Street's projections:


YHOORevenueYOY GrowthEPSYOY Growth

Consensus estimate
 $1,054.21 million
 (3%)
 $0.18
 (52.6%)


Q1 actuals
 $1,043 million

 $0.15
 (60.5%)


DIFFERENCE
 ($11.21 million)
 (1%)
 ($0.03)
 (7.9%)



Sources: S&P Capital IQ and Yahoo press release. 
Commenting on the results, CEO Marissa Mayer said in a press release:

We anticipated that we would grow GAAP revenue ahead of revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA, and that's precisely what we saw this quarter. For the next phase of the transformation, we will focus on accelerating our GAAP revenue growth while managing our margins and costs.

What went right: Mayer is correct to point to top-line gains. Gross revenue was up 8.2% before TAC, or traffic acquisition costs. Mobile (up 61.5%) and in-house search (up 19.5%) helped produce the gain. We may see even more of this sort of growth in future quarters now that Yahoo! has reached an amended, non-exclusive accord with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to pursue search deals on any platform. Expect Mayer to go where the money is. 





What went wrong: Growth didn't come cheap. TAC soared 298.9% as search became more expensive. Specifically, search-related TAC jumped over a hundredfold -- from $686,000 to just over $100 million. Development costs for new and existing apps also surged, rising 21.8% and taking a bite out of profits. Separately, cash flow from operations, or CFFO, suffered a $3.28 billion hit from taxes due on the sale of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock. Without it, CFFO was on track to more than double.
What's next: Yahoo! chose not to provide a second-quarter outlook in its press release. Analysts tracked by S&P Capital IQ have the company generating $1,039.5 million in revenue and $0.20 a share in adjusted profit, versus $1,040.37 million and $0.37 a share in last year's Q2. Longer term, analysts have Yahoo! earnings declining an average of 0.31% annually over the next three to five years.
And in terms of the overall business? Investors should be watching for signs that Mayer is making good on her promise to reverse the equation and grow revenue faster than TAC. If she proves up to the task, cash and profits will flow like a wild mountain river, flush after the thaw.

        Commentary: Mayer’s investments have yet to pay off

Bloomberg



Marissa Mayer logged more than a dozen years at Google before taking the helm at Yahoo in July 2012.

Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer has been hiring product engineers this year with the same gusto as when she was a top executive at Google Inc. The problem with that strategy is that Yahoo

                                         unlike its larger rival 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    GOOG, +0.49%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         isn’t seeing any revenue boost yet from its investments. Product-development costs surged 23% in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, while revenue slipped 3% on a year-over-year basis (minus traffic-acquisition costs, or TAC). That helps explain why Yahoo’s third-quarter operating income showed a year-over-year drop of 39%, after that important metric had climbed 44% during the first six months of 2013. Yahoo reported its third-quarter results late Tuesday.  Much of that higher spending was due to the acquisition of Tumblr, which Yahoo bought earlier this year for close to $1 billion, and whose operating expenses are now counted on Yahoo’s income statement, according to CFO Ken Goldman But Mayer has also been on a hiring binge at Yahoo, especially in engineering, bringing 1,000 engineers aboard so far this year. Sales and marketing costs also rose, climbing 5% on a year-over-year basis.







While Yahoo’s total operating costs in the quarter were held flat from a year ago, at $1.05 billion, they would have risen if the company hadn’t booked a restructuring charge in the year-earlier period. Mayer and CFO Goldman both said during the company’s earnings conference call Tuesday that expenses are expected to level off in 2014. That may be just in time for Yahoo shareholders, since the company also issued a fourth-quarter revenue forecast range that was slightly below Wall Street’s earlier expectations. The new forecast signals that Yahoo will post either little or no top-line growth in 2013, Mayer’s first full year at the helm, even though the company’s number of paid search clicks rose 21% in the third quarter. The just-completed quarter saw a huge decline in another important Yahoo metric: cash flow from operations. Net operating cash plunged 72% during the quarter, compared with a year earlier, and is down 48% for the first nine months of this year. All this might be cause for alarm if not for Yahoo’s lucrative stake in Alibaba, the biggest online-commerce company in China.

Some Wall Street analysts estimate that at least half of Yahoo’s $34 billion market valuation is owed to its Alibaba shares, which are expected to soar in value with an Alibaba IPO. Sources have told this column that the offering will come next year, and Goldman said Tuesday that Yahoo does “expect that Alibaba will IPO at some point,” though he didn’t offer any time frame.  Yahoo said it had amended a prior agreement with Alibaba and will now sell at least 208 million shares of the company in any IPO, down from at least 261.5 million shares previously.  Yahoo invested $1 billion in Alibaba in 2005, in exchange for a 40% stake, and still owns about a quarter of the company. Once it does sell Alibaba shares, Yahoo will be able to book extraordinary gains from those transactions for at least several quarters, as it did after selling a large Alibaba stake last September. Yahoo has been using the gains from that sale to fund investments and buy back shares, thereby reducing its share count and raising per-share earnings. Even as it does, Yahoo will continue to benefit from its equity interests in both Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, as it did in the third quarter. Yet the gains from any Alibaba share sales will be booked in a limited number of quarters, even as Yahoo’s operations continue to struggle. And investors just got a preview of what Yahoo’s financials might look like after the Alibaba gains are gone. On a GAAP basis, Yahoo’s net income plunged by 91% in the third quarter to $297 million, or 28 cents per share. That’s because last year’s third-quarter earnings line ballooned by $2.8 billion with the sale of Alibaba shares.  And 78% of net income for the third quarter was due to what’s called “earnings from equity interests” on Yahoo’s income statement — which is primarily from the investments in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba. That line rose to $233 million. In other words, less than a quarter of Yahoo’s net profit came from its own operations. Investors whose optimism has helped drive a doubling of Yahoo’s share price since Mayer took the CEO job in July 2012 should be aware that they’re making a bet on a revenue turnaround that has yet to materialize. Unless Yahoo’s investments begin to boost its top line, growth investors should be nowhere near this stock once the company has booked most of the financial gains from its Alibaba share sales.  Note: The author has no positions, long or short, in Yahoo or any of its rivals.

(NASDAQ:AABA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Yahoo Inc. - Breaking Up Is Hard To Do But Profitable - 11% UpsideFeb. 2.15 | About: Yahoo! Inc. (AABA) Roundabout Asset Management Special situations, quantitative, hedge fund managerRoundabout Asset Management LLCSummarySpin-off of Alibaba shares is a significant valuation catalyst.Upside of 11.2% should be realized in less than twelve months.Recent concerns over tax-minimizing corporate transactions has presented this opportunity.Background
On January 27, 2015 Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) released its 4Q14 earnings. As part of the release, YHOO informed shareholders that it would spin-off the remainder of its stake in Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) in a tax-free manner to shareholders. Based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis, YHOO shares are trading at a significant discount to fair value and provide an attractive opportunity for investors.
Company Description
Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, YHOO is a global Internet media company that offers communications, content, and a community platform that delivers consumer experiences and advertising solutions across digital screens. Revenues are derived between Search (40.5%), Display (37.8%) and Other (21%).
The Company has struggled in recent years with competition from Google, Facebook, and other social media platforms, as indicated by revenue contraction in seven out of the past eight quarters.
CEO Marissa Mayer was hired in 2012 to turnaround the failing core business, but improvements have yet to materialize. The significant rise in YHOO shares since her hiring are due to the Company's holdings of Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan Corp. (OTCPK:YAHOY).
Spin-Off Details
The spin-off of BABA shares to YHOO shareholders is expected to occur in the 4Q15 after YHOO's lock-up expires in September 2015. The "SpinCo" will house all of YHOO's remaining shares in BABA and a legacy, ancillary, operating business of Yahoo ("Active Trade or Business", or "ATB"). The SpinCo will assume no debt and YHOO will retain its cash.
The transaction still requires Board, IRS, and SEC approval. Most importantly, the Company will look to the IRS to provide a favorable ruling in regard to the tax-free nature of the deal. The proposed transaction is similar in nature to the recent spin-off of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) from Liberty Ventures (NASDAQ:LVNTA) in 2014, which we use as a proxy for timing purposes.

The pro-forma structure of YHOO and SpinCo is as follows: 
Opportunity - 11% upside in ~11 months
The spin-off of LTRPA from LVNTA took 321 days between announcement to completion, and I believe this transaction should be no different.
The valuation framework deployed below contains a few assumptions that err on the side of conservatism.

Given that the SpinCo will not be a "pure-play" the shares will trade at a discount to BABA shares. However, given that the ATB will likely be immaterial compared with the value of the BABA shares (~$35 billion) and relatively equal liquidity between the SpinCo shares and BABA shares (SpinCo will have 383.6 million BABA shares vs. the 320.106 million shares offered in the IPO). I estimate that the discount will be minimal and likely in the neighborhood of 0%-2%.
Assuming this transaction goes forward, shareholders can expect YAHOY to be spun-off in a similar manner, however, given the potential taxable event, I have assigned a 10% discount.
For the core YHOO business I am using the average analyst estimated EBITDA for FY15 and applying a 4.0x EV/EBITDA multiple. This multiple is significantly below comps and below analysts' estimates who favor using a higher multiple (closer to 5.0x by my estimates) on a higher 2016 EBITDA level. According to one analyst, the peer group trades at 6.7x EBITDA (implying that I am using a 40% discount to peers).
I apply a 7.5% discount to YHOO's net cash position as while I believe Yahoo's management will remain good stewards of capital (the Company has reduced gross shares outstanding by 29% since 2012 for $9.4 billion), there could be potential for dilutive spending by management. The Company has said that it anticipates returning ~50% of the after-tax proceeds to shareholders so we know that at least half of the cash on hand will not be used inappropriately.

In addition to the individual component discounts, I apply a 15% "HoldCo" discount to the remaining YAHOY, YHOO Core Business and YHOO Net Cash as I believe the Street will ultimately assess a sum-of-the-parts discount on the HoldCo.
Risks
Core YHOO continues decline: Revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA were down 1% and 13% respectively in 2014 and analysts are estimating that revenue and EBITDA will fall 5.1% and 17% respectively in 2015 according to Bloomberg. While Mayer has tried to stabilize and grow the business, there is no guarantee that she will be successful in the near future. The valuation framework used considers this fact and if the core business turns around there is additional upside for shareholders.
Unfavorable IRS ruling: While YHOO has enlisted the help of tax advisors before announcing the spin-off, and even considering the LTRPA spin-off, there is no guarantee that the IRS will allow the tax-free deal. If the IRS does not give its approval, shareholders are likely to value YHOO assuming BABA and YAHOY are fully-taxed, which could push shares of YHOO down to $31.50 (28% downside).
Technical Details
In order to capture the spread described in the valuation section investors should short 0.40 shares of BABA for every one share of YHOO and short 2.10 shares of YAHOY for every one share of YHOO (this refers to the shares traded in Japan and not the ADR that this article references). These ratios will ensure YHOO shareholders are not impacted by the changes in BABA and YAHOY share prices. Borrowing costs are currently minimal.
Conclusion
While the arbitrage community may be somewhat apprehensive about tax-related deals after the recent fallout from the Shire/AbbVie cancelled merger, the spin-off of BABA shares from YHOO is far less likely to run into any trouble with the IRS and the current upside makes this an attractive situation.

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.
Products and services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services
Yahoo operated a portal that provides the latest news, entertainment, and sports information. The portal also gave users access to other Yahoo services like Yahoo! Search, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Maps, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Messenger.

Yahoo provided Internet communication services such as Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Mail. As of May 2007, its e-mail service would offer unlimited storage.[75]
Yahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360°, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011.[76]
Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a "universal profile" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.[77]
Content
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page.
On March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54.[78]

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Next
Yahoo Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo technologies currently undergoing testing. It contains forums for Yahoo users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo technologies.[97]
Yahoo BOSS
Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Marissa Mayer (2012–2017)[162]
Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)
Scott Thompson (2012)
Tim Morse Interim (2011–2012)
Carol Bartz (2009–2011)
Jerry Yang (2007–2009)
Terry Semel (2001–2007)
Timothy Koogle (1995–2001)

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]







Logo used from January 1994 to March 1995









Logo used from March to August 1995









Logo used from August to December 1995









Logo used from January 1996 to June 2002

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a "universal profile" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.[77]
Content
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility

Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Marissa Mayer (2012–2017)[162]
Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)
Scott Thompson (2012)
Tim Morse Interim (2011–2012)
Carol Bartz (2009–2011)
Jerry Yang (2007–2009)
Terry Semel (2001–2007)
Timothy Koogle (1995–2001)

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]
Yahoo Meme
Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management
Chief Executive Officers

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Search BOSS
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]
Yahoo Accessibility
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]







Logo used from January 1994 to March 1995









Logo used from March to August 1995









Logo used from August to December 1995









Logo used from January 1996 to June 2002

After Woman’s Mysterious Death At Mexico Resort, Tourists Report Similar Incidents


Something sinister is happening at a handful of luxury Mexican resorts - at least according to one lawyer and some tourists who’ve vacationed there. After a young woman died under mysterious circumstances at the Iberostar Paraiso Resort in Playa Del Carmen, her family and attorneys have been looking for a plausible explanation for what happened to her. Abbey Conner, 20, died in January within just a few hours of arriving at a resort with her family. She and her brother, Austin Conner, 23, were drinking and swimming in chest-deep water at the hotel pool. The last thing Austin remembered was taking some shots at the bar. The next? Waking up inside an ambulance. Read: Woman Dies After Taking Mystery

Key witness identified in Minneapolis officer-involved shooting that killed Australian bride-to-be


Minnesota officials have identified and located a key witness to the officer-involved shooting that killed an Australian bride-to-be in Minneapolis last weekend. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced in a press release Friday night that its agents interviewed the witness, who was seen riding a bike in the area immediately before the shooting and stopped at the scene to watch as two Minneapolis police officers provided medical assistance to Justine Ruszczyk. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is conducting the investigation into the incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department, is urging anyone who may have also witnessed the shooting to contact them at 651-793-7000.

Hillary Clinton is America's Biggest-And Most Important-Loser


Hillary Clinton's election loss can still be seen and felt across the country, just as if it were that same night in early November when millions were glued to their screens, witnessing a stunning moment of history in real time. Now, six months into a presidency that isn't hers, the former Democratic candidate continues battling criticisms from all sides of the nation, as if she were still on the ballot. The right covers her flaws with tunnel vision, even as a failed candidate with no tangible influence in policymaking or domestic affairs, focusing on Clinton while explosive new reports undermine the ethics of Donald Trump’s White House.

Selena Gomez's Gym Style Seems Simple - Until You See Her Sports Bras



 
 A post shared by Amy Rosoff Davis (@amyrosoffdavis) on May 17, 2016 at 4:25pm PDT 
 
 
 We're well aware of Selena Gomez's bikini style and even her favorite travel-ready airport looks , but let's take a second to talk about her undeniable gym style. Whether Selena is hitting the gym in West Hollywood or working with her personal trainer Amy Rosoff Davis and getting in shape with some Pilates , she's got a signature look. And like her airport style, it's rooted in high-waisted bottoms and a lot of slouchy, cropped tops. In this instance, that means high-waisted leggings and sports bras or loose-fitting gym tees and sweatshirts - and don't forget her standard pair of Adidas Boosts or running shoes.

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]

The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]

Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users.

Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]







Logo used from January 1994 to March 1995









Logo used from March to August 1995









Logo used from August to December 1995









Logo used from January 1996 to June 2002









Logo used from June 2002 to November 2009

After Woman’s Mysterious Death At Mexico Resort, Tourists Report Similar Incidents


Something sinister is happening at a handful of luxury Mexican resorts - at least according to one lawyer and some tourists who’ve vacationed there. After a young woman died under mysterious circumstances at the Iberostar Paraiso Resort in Playa Del Carmen, her family and attorneys have been looking for a plausible explanation for what happened to her. Abbey Conner, 20, died in January within just a few hours of arriving at a resort with her family. She and her brother, Austin Conner, 23, were drinking and swimming in chest-deep water at the hotel pool. The last thing Austin remembered was taking some shots at the bar. The next? Waking up inside an ambulance. Read: Woman Dies After Taking Mystery

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced in a press release Friday night that its agents interviewed the witness, who was seen riding a bike in the area immediately before the shooting and stopped at the scene to watch as two Minneapolis police officers provided medical assistance to Justine Ruszczyk. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is conducting the investigation into the incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department, is urging anyone who may have also witnessed the shooting to contact them at 651-793-7000.

Hillary Clinton is America's Biggest-And Most Important-Loser


Hillary Clinton's election loss can still be seen and felt across the country, just as if it were that same night in early November when millions were glued to their screens, witnessing a stunning moment of history in real time. Now, six months into a presidency that isn't hers, the former Democratic candidate continues battling criticisms from all sides of the nation, as if she were still on the ballot. The right covers her flaws with tunnel vision, even as a failed candidate with no tangible influence in policymaking or domestic affairs, focusing on Clinton while explosive new reports undermine the ethics of Donald Trump’s White House.

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]
Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.[101]

Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]
Storing personal information and tracking usage

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]

Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

Ice-T Addresses Allegations of Wife Coco’s ‘Cultural Appropriation’HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearch0Ice-T Addresses Allegations of Wife Coco’s ‘Cultural Appropriation’Cindy ArboledaYahoo StyleJuly 21, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareTwitter came for Coco Austin after she debuted her a new hairstyle, which she self-titled Da Coco Swoop. Now Ice-T is fighting back. (Photo: Getty Images)MoreCoco Austin is known for her reality TV stardom, voluptuous figure, and marriage to one of the founding fathers of gangster rap, Ice-T. But over the past few days what people have been talking about in relation to Coco is her hair. Recently the mother of one debuted a new hairstyle and dubbed it “Da Coco side swoop.” Almost immediately she came under fire on social media, with many calling her out for cultural appropriation.The Twitterverse was enraged that Austin seemed to claim ownership of the box braids, even going so far as to rename the classic and traditionally black hairstyle. Commenters did not mince words in calling her on cultural appropriation, making sure to also point out that this is a hairstyle black women have been wearing forever. “Da Coco Swoop braids” I blame black men for allowing their white significant other to even remotely think this was ok @FINALLEVEL she wrong pic.twitter.com/ycqZvI2wEQ — (@LafayeGallagher) July 17, 2017  Little black girls wear braids but get told they have to take it out in school…but then here comes the Coco Swoop ‍♀️ — X I O M A R A (@XiomaraLaChelle) July 20, 2017  This is cultural appropriation. It has always been BRAIDS & now a white girl is calling it the “coco swoop” like it’s something new. pic.twitter.com/C3jRO3xb4I — Tia (@arollingbeauty) July 21, 2017 It’s kind of shocking for Coco to think that she was inventing something with the “Coco Sweep.” Not only is the look popular and classic, it’s also been highly visible in recent decades. It’s impossible to think that Coco didn’t see Beyoncé wear the same hairstyle on her 2016 visual album, Lemonade. The correct name for these kind of braids are lemonade braids ‍♀️ — CMB (@Chaneeeemarie) July 20, 2017 If we go back to 2007, we can see Alicia Keys rocking the same ‘do. Y’all know Alicia keys slayed the braids before y’all called them #lemonadebraids pic.twitter.com/DIt9uNexdi — ✨QUEEN✨ (@JoyyUnSpeakable) July 14, 2017 And of course Janet Jackson showcased the style in the early 1990s. Reasons We Are A Part Of The Rhythm NationJanet’s braids in Poetic Justicehttps://t.co/TjC7uQ9Kkg@JanetJackson#actress #singer pic.twitter.com/8BppwIu7qd — Daniel Paul (@DanDBear) January 3, 2017 While those against Coco were loud and proud, there were others who commented defending Austin’s hairstyle. “If you guys read the original post she didn’t rename the braids, she clearly said she names all her hairstyles, braids and no braids. Stop looking to spread hate and negativity, you are free to not follow her if it bothers you so much,” wrote an Instagram follower.Now her husband, Ice-T, is fighting back and defending his wife for her style choice. “Wrong for what? Braiding her hair?? You sound dumb,” he tweeted to the naysayers. Wrong for what? Braiding her hair?? You sound Dumb. https://t.co/fcyJ4ZEs0u — ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) July 17, 2017 He continued advocating on behalf of his wife through a series of emotional tweets. Lol… I honestly can't believe you MFs are STILL taking bout braids for 3 days…. Lol https://t.co/rtLVAKfm4R — ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) July 20, 2017  I love you too…! Don’t trip… Crack is a hell of a Drug…..

Ice-T Addresses Allegations of Wife Coco’s ‘Cultural Appropriation’HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearch0Ice-T Addresses Allegations of Wife Coco’s ‘Cultural Appropriation’Cindy ArboledaYahoo StyleJuly 21, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareTwitter came for Coco Austin after she debuted her a new hairstyle, which she self-titled Da Coco Swoop. Now Ice-T is fighting back. (Photo: Getty Images)MoreCoco Austin is known for her reality TV stardom, voluptuous figure, and marriage to one of the founding fathers of gangster rap, Ice-T. But over the past few days what people have been talking about in relation to Coco is her hair. Recently the mother of one debuted a new hairstyle and dubbed it “Da Coco side swoop.” Almost immediately she came under fire on social media, with many calling her out for cultural appropriation.The Twitterverse was enraged that Austin seemed to claim ownership of the box braids, even going so far as to rename the classic and traditionally black hairstyle. Commenters did not mince words in calling her on cultural appropriation, making sure to also point out that this is a hairstyle black women have been wearing forever. “Da Coco Swoop braids” I blame black men for allowing their white significant other to even remotely think this was ok @FINALLEVEL she wrong pic.twitter.com/ycqZvI2wEQ — (@LafayeGallagher) July 17, 2017  Little black girls wear braids but get told they have to take it out in school…but then here comes the Coco Swoop ‍♀️ — X I O M A R A (@XiomaraLaChelle) July 20, 2017  This is cultural appropriation. It has always been BRAIDS & now a white girl is calling it the “coco swoop” like it’s something new. pic.twitter.com/C3jRO3xb4I — Tia (@arollingbeauty) July 21, 2017 It’s kind of shocking for Coco to think that she was inventing something with the “Coco Sweep.” Not only is the look popular and classic, it’s also been highly visible in recent decades. It’s impossible to think that Coco didn’t see Beyoncé wear the same hairstyle on her 2016 visual album, Lemonade. The correct name for these kind of braids are lemonade braids ‍♀️ — CMB (@Chaneeeemarie) July 20, 2017 If we go back to 2007, we can see Alicia Keys rocking the same ‘do. Y’all know Alicia keys slayed the braids before y’all called them #lemonadebraids pic.twitter.com/DIt9uNexdi — ✨QUEEN✨ (@JoyyUnSpeakable) July 14, 2017 And of course Janet Jackson showcased the style in the early 1990s.

Stop looking to spread hate and negativity, you are free to not follow her if it bothers you so much,” wrote an Instagram follower.Now her husband, Ice-T, is fighting back and defending his wife for her style choice. “Wrong for what? Braiding her hair?? You sound dumb,” he tweeted to the naysayers. Wrong for what? Braiding her hair?? You sound Dumb. https://t.co/fcyJ4ZEs0u — ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) July 17, 2017 He continued advocating on behalf of his wife through a series of emotional tweets.

Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[4][5] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[6][7] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[8] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, served as CEO and President of Yahoo until June 2017.[9]
It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[10] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016.[3][11][12] According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month.[13][14] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted "more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages".[15]
Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s,[16] and in 2017, Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion, excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[17]

Founding




Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo


In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[18][19] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!",[20][21] the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, being their first product and original purpose.[22][23] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[24]
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[25] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[26] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[27] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[28] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
Expansion
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users[29] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine.[22] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[30]




Yahoo headquarters in 2001


Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.[31]
In February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.[32] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[33] In September 2011 she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left.[34] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.[35] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[36]
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.[36][37][38] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[39]
On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.[40]




Yahoo! sign at Times Square


On May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."[41][42] On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially.[43] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.[44]
On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[45]
Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.[46]
In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.[47]
On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.[48]

By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.[49] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,[50] and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.[51] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company."[52] The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.[53]
The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016 that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.[54][55]
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.[56][57][58] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella.[59] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.[60][61]
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,[62] one of the largest breaches reported to date.[63] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.[64][65] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.[66] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to "forge" cookies.[67]
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,[68] causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.[69] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.[69]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[70][71][72][73][53]
Altaba, Inc.
Main article: Altaba
On June 16th, 2017, parts of the original Yahoo Inc, which were not purchased by Verizon Communications, were renamed Altaba Inc. On the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website, they listed the new company as a "non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."[74]
The former Yahoo Inc. ticker symbol, YHOO, was retired in favor of AABA. This took place on Monday, June 19th, 2017.

Co-branded Internet services
For more details on this topic, see AT&T Internet Services § Conversion to AT&T Internet Services.
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC),[79][80] Verizon Communications,[81][82] Rogers Communications,[83][84] and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.
Mobile services
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.
Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.
The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.[85]
As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.[86]
On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.[87]
Commerce
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.[88] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.[89]
Small business
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.[citation needed]
Advertising
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.
Following the closure of a "beta" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.[90]
Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.[91]
On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo,[92] an online advertising management platform.[93] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.[94]
In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft.[95] But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.[96]

Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology.[98] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.[99]
In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.[100]

Main article: Yahoo Meme
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.
Y!Connect

Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.[102]
Yahoo Axis
Main article: Yahoo Axis
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012.[103] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.[104]
Yahoo SearchMonkey
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.
Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.[105]
Defunct services
Main article: List of Yahoo-owned sites and services § Closed/defunct services
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web.[106] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages.[107] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive,[108] OOcities.com, and other such databases.[109]
Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.[110]
Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009.[111] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.[112]
Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section.[113] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.[114]
Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.
Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian.[115] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did "not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement".[116]
Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service.[117] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).[118]
In early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.[119][120]
Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.[121]
The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.
11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.[122] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.[citation needed]
The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."[123] On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.[124]
Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo.[125] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.[126]
Privacy




Protest against the mass surveillance by the NSA


In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.[127]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.[128][129]
In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a "coordinated effort" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.[130]

Working with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors.[131] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.[132]
On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a "Do Not Track" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.[133] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the "Do Not Track" browser setting.[134]
According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events.[135] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.[135]
On September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.[136]
In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.[137]
Criticism
Main article: Criticism of Yahoo
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party.[138] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine.[139] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009.[140] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.[141][142]
Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for "providing state secrets to foreign entities"[143] as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo.[144] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate.[145] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, DC and other purchases.[146]
In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address.[147] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights[148] sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.[149]
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's "user created" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.[150] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active.[151] Yahoo was[when?] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group,[152] which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website "Cryptome" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers.[153]
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised,[154][155] Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.[156]
Allegations of sexism against men
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated "Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.[157][158]
The lawsuit states: "Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext."[158]
A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.[159][160][161]
Management

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business.[163]
Yahoo International




Yahoo's Bangalore office


Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.
Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%,[164] YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.
Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[165]
On March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.[166][167][168][169][170]
Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.[171] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.
On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, "Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo's information." Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.[172]
On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com,[173] and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page.
Logos and themes




Logo used from 1996 to 2013 (shown: purple variant used from 2009), red version still used by Yahoo! Japan






Yahoo logo with the Y! moniker (2009–2013)






Yahoo! sign with address at its headquarters


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side.[174] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014.[175] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: "Y!"[176]
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.[177][178] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.[179] Mayer explains:

So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.[180]

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.[181] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.[182]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
