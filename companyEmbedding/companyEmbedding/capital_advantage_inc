Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
