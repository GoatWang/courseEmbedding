Photronics Promotes Richelle E. Burr to Vice President & General Counsel | Business Wire
























































Photronics Promotes Richelle E. Burr to Vice President & General 
      Counsel






January 22, 2010 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



BROOKFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Photronics, Inc. (Nasdaq:PLAB), a worldwide leader in supplying 
      innovative imaging technology solutions to the global electronics 
      industry, is pleased to announce that Richelle E. Burr has been promoted 
      to Vice President & General Counsel. Since 2003, Ms. Burr has acted in 
      the role of Corporate Counsel for the company. She has over 18 years of 
      business and corporate legal experience serving the semiconductor and 
      industrial manufacturing industries. Ms. Burr's experience includes 
      acquisitions and divestitures, international business transactions, 
      finance and securities law.
    

      Prior to joining Photronics, Ms. Burr was Assistant Joint Ventures 
      Counsel as well as Securities and Finance Counsel for Union Carbide 
      Corporation, where she provided general corporate legal advice on joint 
      venture formations, corporate acquisitions and divestitures, Securities 
      and Exchange Act filing reviews, as well as various financing 
      transactions. Ms. Burr was also counsel to the polypropylene business 
      and an international joint venture in Italy.
    

      Ms. Burr earned her juris doctorate from Quinnipiac University School of 
      Law and is a member of the Connecticut Bar.
    

      Constantine (“Deno”) Macricostas, Photronics’ Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer commented, "Ms. Burr's efforts and accomplishments 
      have been instrumental for Photronics. Last fall, she provided the legal 
      guidance necessary to lead our team through a successful stock and notes 
      offering. Additionally, she continues to maneuver the complex 
      international legal landscape as we migrate our global manufacturing 
      network to match customer needs. Richelle has proven herself to be an 
      integral member of our Executive Management Team.”
    

About Photronics


      Photronics is a leading worldwide manufacturer of photomasks. Photomasks 
      are high precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of 
      electronic circuits. A key element in the manufacture of semiconductors 
      and flat panel displays, photomasks are used to transfer circuit 
      patterns onto semiconductor wafers and flat panel substrates during the 
      fabrication of integrated circuits, a variety of flat panel displays 
      and, to a lesser extent, other types of electrical and optical 
      components. They are produced in accordance with product designs 
      provided by customers at strategically located manufacturing facilities 
      in Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional information on the 
      Company can be accessed at www.photronics.com.
    

      The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe 
      harbor” for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of 
      Photronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). The forward-looking 
      statements contained in this press release and other parts of 
      Photronics’ web site involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the 
      Company’s operations, markets, products, services, prices, and other 
      factors as discussed in filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (SEC). These risks and uncertainties include, but are not 
      limited to, economic, competitive, legal, governmental, and 
      technological factors. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the 
      Company’s expectations will be realized. The Company assumes no 
      obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements.
