 Career History



President

                                    2014 - Current                


Destra Capital Advisors LLC


                  Destra Capital Advisors' 'Responsible Alpha' investment philosophy is based on the premise that downside protection is key to the successful investing. The firm's asset managers offer uniquely sophisticated investment products that seek to limit loss as the market falls and provide upside capture as the market rises. Because their funds seek to limit downside risk, they don't have to rely on oversized gains when the market rallies to offset earlier losses. This gives investors the opportunity to earn high lasting returns without undue volatility. Destra manages the Destra Focused Equity Fund, the Destra Preferred and Income Securities Fund and the Destra Dividend Total Return Fund.                




Senior Managing Director, Product & Business Development

                                    Current                


Destra Capital Management LLC


                  Founded by Dominic Martellaro and Nicholas Dalmaso, Destra Capital Management LLC is a fund distributor located in Lisle, Illinois.
