Christy Norton is a powerhouse for food and beverage companies, ag-supply companies, manufacturers, processors, distributors, and cooperatives. Wise business leaders want and need to be prepared for multiple market scenarios. With Christy’s insights and strategies, leaders are able to act more quickly and effectively execute the thoughtful plans she helps them formulate.

Business owners are constantly on the hunt for fresh ideas that add value, and Christy supplies them with a constant stream of knowledge from her immersion in their industry. She understands how to run businesses effectively and profitably, while monitoring operations, employees, and customers.
Some of Christy’s recent projects include:

Helping food and beverage companies determine total cost of ownership for expansion and ensuring new or expanded lines fit with their growth model.
Securing research and development credits and employing other tax-savings strategies for food and beverage companies.
Assisting agricultural cooperatives with capital and financing strategies to maximize member returns and maintain cooperative cash flow.
Assisting local water districts with new California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regulations which results in improved processes to maintain compliance with their standards.

Norton Security covers PCs, Macs, Androids, iPads and iPhones. Some features are not available on iPad and iPhone.
Auto-scan of apps on Google Play supported on Android 4.0.3 or later except for Samsung devices. Samsung devices running Android 4.2 or later are supported. For earlier versions of Android, the Google Play “Share” function must be used to scan apps on Google Play.
Details about your Norton subscription:

Your subscription begins when your purchase is completed for online payments, (or otherwise, when your payment is received). You must download and install on each device to be protected by Norton.
By subscribing, you are purchasing a recurring subscription which will automatically renew annually after the first term.
The price quoted today is valid for the first term of your subscription (i.e., 1 year or 2 years, depending on your selection). After that, your subscription will automatically renew and be billed each year at the current renewal price. The price is subject to change, but we will always notify you in advance.
You can unsubscribe any time at manage.norton.com or by contacting Norton Support. For more details, please visit the Norton Return Policy.
Your subscription includes coverage on the specified number of devices, protection updates and features that may be added, modified or removed, subject to the acceptance of the Norton License Agreement.

‡ Norton Family and Norton Family Premier features are not supported on Mac.
1 Norton Performance: For more detailed information about Norton product performance tests, please see:
AV-TEST, “Best Protection 2015 Award,” February 2016
AV-TEST, “Product Review and Certification Report,” March-April 2016
PassMark Software, “Consumer Security Products Performance Benchmarks (Edition 3),” February 2016

2 Virus Protection Promise: To be eligible for the Virus Protection Promise, you must have a qualifying Norton subscription and unless you have Norton Small Business, you must also have purchased, renewed or upgraded that Norton subscription directly from Symantec, or subscribe to the Norton Automatic Renewal Service. If a Norton expert is unable to remove the virus from your device, then you may receive a full refund on the actual price paid for your current Norton subscription term, or the term of your current Norton subscription bundle. Or, if your bundled purchase contains a Norton subscription with a non-Norton subscription/product, your refund will be limited to the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of your Norton subscription for the current term, not to exceed the total price paid for that bundle. The refund will be net of any discounts or refunds received and less any shipping, handling and applicable taxes, except in certain states and countries where shipping, handling and taxes are refundable. The refund does not apply to any damages incurred as a result of viruses. See Norton.com/guarantee for details including qualifying Norton subscriptions.

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web. Cookies can make it faster to load a website that you visit often, but these files stay on you pc all the time if you don,t clean them all the time . Many antivirus company claim that they will improve your PC performance by removing these and in many circumstances  this is true, however only few company proved this to their users. 
Some really good antivirus company offer special features to the antivirus programs or apps that clean your PC junk files, remove spyware sheets from your computer and allow you to add or remove files, some products also include defragment option on your free scan to speed up your PC performance. So the answer to the question is yes, a free virus scan can detect all of the factors that combine to make your computer slow and help you eliminate them.

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web. Cookies can make it faster to load a website that you visit often, but these files stay on you pc all the time if you don,t clean them all the time . Many antivirus company claim that they will improve your PC performance by removing these and in many circumstances  this is true, however only few company proved this to their users. 
Some really good antivirus company offer special features to the antivirus programs or apps that clean your PC junk files, remove spyware sheets from your computer and allow you to add or remove files, some products also include defragment option on your free scan to speed up your PC performance. So the answer to the question is yes, a free virus scan can detect all of the factors that combine to make your computer slow and help you eliminate them.

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Best Antivirus Software Features 2016                          

Antivirus software have come a long way since their beginnings in 1987, when efficient removal of viruses was a luxury. Nowadays, the average antivirus software goes far and beyond simply removing malware from a device and protecting it, the products have evolved into more of a complete security suite as other dangers to PCs were discovered. As a minimum, antivirus software should be able to scan a computer, detect malware and remove it; if the program doesn’t do achieve that at least, it’s not an antivirus! Antivirus software today is capable of much more, allowing you to further protect your digital world in many different ways.
The first of our top features you should look out for in an antivirus is file backup in the cloud. Backing up your files in the cloud takes away the dangers of physical damage to your computer, examples of which could be your computer hardware malfunctioning or being destroyed (by accident or maliciously), having your computer stolen, natural disasters ruining your hard drive… There are many possibilities that will occur at least once in someone’s lifetime, so it’s smart to be protected from it. Backing up your files in the cloud is one way of achieving this. When you backup your files in the cloud, you create a copy of the files that can be restored with a connection to the internet, allowing you to safeguard your private documents, precious family memories in photos and videos, anything which is important to you and is stored on your computer! Ideally, this feature would be extended to your mobile device, as the chances of physical damage, loss or theft of your mobile device is far higher than for your computer.
Our next top feature to look out for in antivirus software products is the employment of a built in VPN service. A VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a way of privatising your internet browsing, which prevents data siphoning attempts by hackers at the source and keeps your history, habits and data inputs safe. A VPN works by connecting your computer to the internet via an server which uses bank-level encryption, making your location and browsing data near impossible to decipher. There have been many cases of identity theft which could have been prevented through the use of a VPN service, by employing one directly in an antivirus it extends the software’s ability to protection you from internet dangers far more proficiently. VPNs are a very rare addition to an antivirus due to the software being relatively new to the mass market and the cost of providing it. If you were to use a VPN software on it’s own you should expect to pay the same as you would for a standard premium antivirus product.
There are many different features you should look out for when looking to buy antivirus software, but file backup and VPN integration are the 2 killer features for 2016.












                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner.

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web. Cookies can make it faster to load a website that you visit often, but these files stay on you pc all the time if you don,t clean them all the time . Many antivirus company claim that they will improve your PC performance by removing these and in many circumstances  this is true, however only few company proved this to their users. 
Some really good antivirus company offer special features to the antivirus programs or apps that clean your PC junk files, remove spyware sheets from your computer and allow you to add or remove files, some products also include defragment option on your free scan to speed up your PC performance. So the answer to the question is yes, a free virus scan can detect all of the factors that combine to make your computer slow and help you eliminate them. 
 












                            What does an antivirus scan do?                           

The label "antivirus" was originally given to programs that identified and removed particular types of malware called a virus. Today, however, antivirus programs are useful for preventing infections caused by many types of malware, including worms, spyware, Trojan horses, rootkits, spyware, keyloggers, ransomware and  adware. So it is very important to use antivirus software as well .
Everyone has some different questions about antivirus, like is what does an antivirus scan do ? The answer is that the antivirus has the power to detect all the problems that can harm your Desktop , laptop or mobile .Every antivirus has a different system and technology to find and justify the bugs problems to be fixed and it also has the solution to make the programs work perfectly . If we look further to find anything unique things  on various antivirus companies ? then we will come to know that, every establish company has their own secret sauce that makes their technology just a little bit different from everyone else, so it gets increasingly difficult to say anything that How ! and  what makes antivirus go.
Some or many  people know and may  hope that  only that anti-virus is supposed to protect them, but they don't know how and can think it should protect against any nasty and harmful thing under the moon. Some people understand that anti-virus software comprises some sort of signature-scanning technology but it's not true at all , and a surprising number of people believe this is where anti-virus technology stopped litrely.
Overall there are 3 types of common scanning method  provided to  the antivirus products detections you’ll find out there and what they do. it’ll hopefully give you a little glimpse into what’s out there and what you should expect your anti-virus product can do.
 
Specific Detection  l  Generic Detection  I  Heuristic Detection
This kind Of detection is the main thing which  is what a lot of people think of when they think of anti-virus scanners. It looks for known malware's by a specific set of  bugs and characteristics. To detect the malware specifically, the scanner looks around for that signature in a fairly to all particular places , because  Each malware uses its own code to do its thing .
Afterwards, generic detection  previously tries to find all unknown viruses by looking for known suspicious behaviour or the file structures. This is where the process scanning gets more broad and speculative.
Basically, with the heuristic detection majorly applies the “smell test” to all files. This test looks around the machines program misbehaviour and look Is there anything about this file that looks hinky or unusual ? Are its structures are behaving odd in a way that would imply that it’s trying to hide or running from  something? Does it behave in a way that benign files generally don’t?
One of this technique can be works fast because it can exclude clean files as much more quickly if a researcher does all the things right, but it’s also fairly easy to evade this sort of detection. Change the code, move it somewhere else, encrypt it, or hide it in some other way, and then the threat doesn’t get detected anymore.
 Overall antivirus products that focus on smaller businesses naturally fall somewhere in between . Hopefully, this also gives you a better idea to think of what is actually going on behind the scenes of your anti-virus scanner so it seems to become more and more friendly and approachable

Required Reading My typical pattern when reviewing a security product line is to start with the standalone antivirus and then summarize the antivirus review as part of my review of the full security suite. If there's an even bigger mega-suite in the mix, I summarize the entry-level suite review. However, I'm going to take a different path this time.
This product has precisely the same excellent security components as Symantec Norton Security Deluxe. These include top-scoring antivirus, award-winning Android security, no-hassle firewall, consistently accurate phishing protection, a full security suite for macOS, and more. The Premium edition adds five more licenses along with parental control and online backup, neither of which is tightly coupled to the suite's other components.
Please read my review of the malware protection and other features of the Deluxe edition first, then come back here for my evaluation of the added Premium features.

Online and Local Backup Security suite vendors like to promote that their products include online backup—it gives them a nice check mark in the features table. However, all too many of them simply offer a branded version of some partner product that their users could get for free directly from the partner. Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security 2017 offers 5GB of backup space that you could just as easily get directly from IDrive, for example.
Norton's Windows-specific backup component is a completely in-house product, and sells separately for $49.99 per year. PCMag's Max Eddy didn't think much of Norton Online Backup, comparing it unfavorably with other standalone backup services. But compared with backup components in other security suites, it looks pretty good.
The online backup component comes pre-configured with a default backup set that defines what to back up, where to store backed-up files, and when to run the backup. It includes files in and below the Documents folder for each user, but specifically omits possibly massive video files and email files by default. You can edit this backup set to fit your own needs, or create any number of additional backup sets.
The default destination for your backed-up files is Norton's secure online storage, but you can also back up locally. While CD/DVD backup was removed in this edition due to low usage, any other drive that shows up in Windows Explorer is a fair target. That includes local hard drives, remote drives, network drives, and even some cloud storage services. The backup system in Kaspersky Total Security doesn't come with online storage, but you can link it to your Dropbox account.
By default, backup occurs automatically when your computer is idle. That's probably best for ongoing maintenance, but you may want to manually launch the first backup when you're done with your system for the day, as the first time can take a while. Subsequent backups only transmit new and changed files, so they run much faster. You can also schedule a backup set to run on a weekly or monthly schedule. You can also choose to throttle back the bandwidth used for backup, an option that's only needed if you don't choose to back up during idle time.

The restore feature also comes pre-configured with logical defaults. It restores files from the most recent backup (though you can choose another) to their original locations (though you can select a different destination). By default, it waits for you to search out the file or files you want to recover. You can optionally browse all backed-up files, or restore the entire backup set. And you can access your backup sets as if they were local files and folders by opening the Norton Backup Drive in Windows Explorer.
Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete also offers 25GB of hosted storage for backing up and syncing files. It keeps up to ten versions of files and lets you create links to securely share backed-up files. BullGuard Premium Protection also lets you share files from its 25GB of online backup. Norton just keeps the latest version, and secure sharing has been dropped in the current version. Few consumers actually used the feature, and it made overall security more complex, according to my Symantec contact.
The fanciest backup system in the world won't help if it never gets used. Norton makes backup almost effortless, which is as it should be.
Parental Control Your Norton Security Premium subscription also includes Symantec Norton Family Premier, a $49.99 value if purchased separately. Yes, the combined price of Norton Online Backup and Norton Family Premier is greater than the price of this entire suite, and much greater than the $10 you spend to upgrade from Norton Family Delux. That's a great deal.
As with Net Nanny, Qustodio Parental Control 2015, and other modern parental control systems, all configuration and reporting takes place online, with a small client app on each Windows, Android, or iOS device, to handle local monitoring and enforcement of House Rules. Sorry, Mac users, this component isn't for you.
To get started, you log in to your Norton account online and create a profile for each child. The profile includes name, birth year, gender, and an optional photo or avatar. You can also add personal information that you don't want the child to share online. Next, you add a device that the child uses or, if it's a PC, the child's Windows user account. You can install the local Norton Family parental control agent on the current device or email a link. Keep going until you've created a profile for each of your kids; there's no specific limit on the number of child profiles or devices.
With that task out of the way, it's time to define House Rules for each profile. First up is Web Supervision, which manages content filtering. Based on the child's age, Norton selects from the 47 content categories and determines whether to block those categories or just give the child a warning. You can pick your own custom set of categories and choose to block, warn, or just silently monitor. ContentWatch Net Nanny 7 is even more flexible, letting you choose allow, block, or warn separately for each category.

When Norton blocks access to a site, it displays the reason. The child can send parents a message explaining the attempt to visit the site, or report that the site is categorized incorrectly. If a child proceeds to the site despite a warning, parents get notification.
Norton actually checks page content if necessary. I found that it allowed access to a short-story website but blocked its erotic stories. It filters secure (HTTPS) traffic, so kids won't evade it by using a secure anonymizing proxy. And it didn't cave to a simple three-word network command that disconnects some less-clever parental control systems. I couldn't find any sites that should have been blocked but weren't.
Forcing Safe Search has become difficult now that popular search portals enforce use of HTTS. Bitdefender and Trend Micro simply dropped that feature from parental control, though Trend Micro Maximum Security attempts to cover up naughty pictures in search results. Norton has taken a different tack. Search Supervision enforces Safe Search on Ask, YouTube, Google, Bing, and Yahoo. It does so using a browser extension, so a clever child might work around this restriction. Your child can turn off Safe Search and briefly see inappropriate links or pictures until the browser extension turns it on again. 
Video Supervision keeps track of the videos your child watches on YouTube or Hulu. Social Media Supervision simply tracks the existence of your child's Facebook account and reports if the child used a spurious age to set up the account, or posted personal information.
All of the components I've mentioned thus far are enabled by default, but Time Supervision is not. Turning this feature on automatically schedules when the child can use the device and sets a daily maximum for screen time, based on the child's age. For example, my imaginary 13-year-old's schedule allowed access from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. daily, and until 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Screen time was capped at two hours for weekdays, five hours on the weekend. If you want to tweak these settings, you must edit each day separately. 
You can also choose whether to cut off access or just issue a warning. Kids can check their remaining time by clicking the Norton Family icon in the notification area. There's also an option to send a request for more time. Android devices can still be used after hours, but Norton prevents all app activity other than calling emergency contacts. 
Note that time scheduling applies separately to each device the child uses. The equivalent feature in Net Nanny is cross-device, so your kid can't time out on the PC and just switch to Android. 
Mobile Parental Control Three more components become available when you assign an Android device to the child's profile. Android protection is equivalent to Norton Family Parental Control (for Android).
Some mobile parental control systems offer geofencing, meaning you can get notification when your child enters or leaves a specific location. Norton's Location Supervision doesn't do that, but if you enable it the child's device reports its position periodically, and you can view current and past locations on a map.
App Supervision lists all non-default apps installed on the child's Android device. See something you don't like? Just check the box to block use of that app.

I couldn't actively test the advanced Text Supervision feature, because my Android test devices all lack cellular data connection. Here's how it works. In the default Monitored mode, the child can text with any contact that's not specifically blocked. Norton logs all text conversations with unknown contacts. Parents can review the conversations and mark the contact as Blocked or Unmonitored. In Blocked mode, unknowns can't contact your child at all until and unless you mark them as Unmonitored. In Unmonitored mode, all contacts not specifically marked as Blocked are permitted, with no logging.
If your child uses an iOS device, you can still install Norton's parental control, the equivalent of Norton Family Parental Control (for iPhone). However, there's just not much to it.
You do get content filtering, but it only works in the app's internal browser. During installation, the app explains how to set up Restrictions so your child can't use Safari or Chrome, disable Norton, or download other browsers. Once that's done, you get the full power of Web Supervision.
Location Supervision is also available, just as it is on Android. Video Supervision and Search Supervision both work. However, on an iOS device there's no Time Supervision, Mobile App Supervision, Text Message Supervision, or Social Media supervision. If you really need full-powered parental control on iOS devices, look to Editors' Choice Kaspersky Safe Kids (for iPhone).
Parental Reporting and Notification So far I've just talked about how you use Norton to define and enforce House Rules. The other half of the equation is what Norton calls Activities—the logs of what your children have been up to. The Activities summary shows the same eight types of supervision, with an overview of the latest activity. You can filter the summary to just look at one device, in which case you'll see a message stating "This feature is not supported" for categories that don't apply to that device.

Clicking on one of the panel opens a more detailed view, and in most cases you can drill down even farther. For example, the Web Supervision summary shows the most-used categories. Clicking it gets a full list of all sites visited, warned, or blocked. And clicking a specific site displays that site's categories, a thumbnail, and any message that the child sent. Search Supervision displays a word cloud of search words in the summary and lists precise search terms when you click. 
On the Video Supervision summary, you see thumbnails of the videos your child has watched. Drilling down lists the videos, along with the device used for viewing and a date/time stamp. And clicking an item in that list lets you view the video's description or jump straight to the video itself.
Your Norton Family account can have more than one designated parent—that makes sense, but it's not a common feature. Parents get email notification of quite a few events. These include visiting a blocked site, sending information that was defined as personal, and installing an app that blocks Norton Family, among other things. You can turn off any or all of these if they get to be too much.
As you can see, this is an extremely comprehensive parental control system, its only weakness being the limited iOS support. As a standalone product, it's an Editors' Choice.
A Star-Studded Suite If Symantec Norton Security Premium were a movie, it would have a star-studded cast. Its antivirus component is an Editors' Choice, as is parental control system. As a separate product, its Android security app is also an Editors' Choice. Various components earn excellent scores in independent lab tests and in our own tests. And it even offers a full security suite for macOS, something few competitors accomplish.
Norton Security Premium is an Editors' Choice for cross-platform multi-device suites, and it's a great choice as long as its ten licenses suffice for your needs. If your household needs security for even more devices, consider our other Editors' Choice in this area, McAfee LiveSafe. It doesn't score as well as Norton in testing, but you can use it on every device in your household, no limits.
