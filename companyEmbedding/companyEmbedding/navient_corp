Deferment and Forbearance


If you have a federal loan and think you may have a problem making on-time payments due to a temporary financial difficulty, you may be eligible for a period of deferment or forbearance.
Note that these options don't release you from your loan, just from making scheduled payments for a brief time. Remember, interest may continue to accrue.
Log in to your account to request deferment or forbearance on your federal loans
If you have a private loan, contact Navient and your other loan servicers to find out what options are available.
Contact us at 800-722-1300 and let us help you make the right decision for your situation.

Deferment
Deferment is a period where you postpone making payments on your loan. Interest doesn't accrue on subsidized federal loans.
Education Related Deferment
You are eligible if you are engaged in a graduate fellowship program, rehabilitation training, internship or residency, or teaching in a teacher shortage area.
In-School Deferment and Parent PLUS Borrower Deferment
You are eligible if you are enrolled at an eligible school at least half time, or if you are a parent with a Parent PLUS Loan who needs to defer repayment while your student is enrolled in school at least half time.
Trouble Making Payments?
If you're having temporary issues making your student loan payments due to unemployment or economic difficulties, be sure to let us know as soon as possible to avoid becoming delinquent.
Contact us at 800-722-1300 and let us help you make the right decision for your situation.
Unemployment Deferment
If you're unemployed (or working less than 30 hours per week) and seeking full-time employment, you may be eligible for an Unemployment Deferment for up to three years.
If you're working 30+ hours per week but you aren't able to afford your monthly payment, you may consider a graduated or income-driven repayment plan.
Learn more about repayment plans based on your income
Economic Hardship Deferment
You may be eligible for an Economic Hardship Deferment for up to three years.
Contact us at 800-722-1300 and let us help you make the right decision for your situation.
Forbearance
Forbearance is a period during which your monthly loan payments are temporarily suspended or reduced. Payments on your loan principal are postponed, but interest will accrue during the forbearance period. Forbearance is intended to help you out in times of temporary need.
Note that the use of forbearance may cause the loss of borrower benefits – such as repayment incentives that can lower your interest rate – for certain loans. Cosigner release for private loans includes an on-time payment requirement. Forbearance may delay eligibility.
Contact us at 800-722-1300 and let us help you make the right decision for your situation.
