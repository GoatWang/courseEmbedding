At H5 PRODUCTS, we go beyond just the buying and selling of products.We are a partner who shares your brand's vision and helps to take it to the next level.Contact Us Today 





 





ABOUT H5 PRODUCTS 










H5 Products is quickly becoming one of the largest and most dynamic ecommerce retailers in the country.  Our business model is based on mutual success of everyone involved by being versatile, adaptable, and building partner type relationships.  We are dedicated to building and protecting the brands and companies we represent by going the extra mile that other retailers simply won’t do.  Our years of retail service is reflected in our growth and one you can count on to care about your brand as much as you do. 










 





WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT WE DOThe brands we have partnered with have come to expect that H5 Products will deliver beyond their expectations when it comes to marketplace execution. H5 Products is committed to making the investment when we have found the right partner.
H5 Products has developed a program that aligns every partner's purpose and vision with that of their marketplace strategy. While every brand has different goals, objectives, restraints and opportunities, we have found that the following topics are what most companies care about and where we can be of value:

Brand Control
Content Management
Targeted Promotion
Premium Experience

At H5 Products, your brand is as important to us as it is to you and we go out of our way to protect as if it were our own.
 





Brand ControlContent ManagementTargeted PromotionPremium Experience



BRAND CONTROLRemember the days when your sales team spent the whole day looking for retailers to sell your products to? Now your sales staff (and anyone else you have had to hire) is now trying to figure out who are the retailers that are selling your products, where did they get your products, and how do you stop them from selling outside of your pricing policies?
Brands now have staff whose job is to police marketplaces and "try" to keep this under control. It starts to feel like a game of "Whac-a-Mole", a game in which you knock one critter out, and then the next one pops up its ugly head.
Brands are now inundated with "tools" for managing the "Whac-a-Mole" process. For a fee you can use their tools to whack the mole (if you can figure out who the mole is), however the tool does not solve the problem, it just helps you play the game.
No matter what anyone tells you (internal or external) this problem can be solved. This is where the rubber meets the road. It takes commitment, strength and long-term vision. It takes working with a partner who has experience with proven strategies, and the stamina and commitment to stay with it.
If you and your team are truly committed to taking care of this problem, and see the impact resolving the problem can have on all your other partners (i.e. brick and mortar), then H5 Products is ready to partner!
 






CONTENT MANAGEMENTBrand image is everything! Brands would not spend so much on packaging, marketing and education if image was not important, or better yet, critical to how the customer perceives the brand.
At H5 Products, the online brand image starts with the image(s) that are displayed, then the content that describes the product (this includes the claims that are made), and ends with the package that arrives at the customer's doorstep.
H5 Products employs a process that is next to none in the industry. It requires a long term investment in people, processes and a commitment not to cut corners.
PICTURE PERFECT

A picture (or many) tell the story. It is critical that the customer sees the product as it should be. H5 Products takes a lot of pride in the images it is willing to post. If the brand's images do not meet H5 Products' strict requirements, H5 Products' photo team creates ones that do, most times with 360 degree views.

ACCURATE CONTENT

What is said is important. Sometimes what is said can be problematic (claims?). H5 Products takes the direction of the brand for proper content (descriptions, features, etc...). Together H5 Products and the brand craft the message to appropriately reflect what is accurate and relevant.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

What a customer says about the product can be a lightning rod for growth, or a reason for contraction. H5 Products takes its own reviews seriously (over 99% satisfaction), and it takes what customers say in product reviews just as serious. This is true whether the sale was through H5 Products or another seller. H5 Products has dedicated resources to ensure customer's needs are met, and when they are not, understanding what else could have been done, and ideally turning any dissatisfaction into a loyal customer.

 






TARGETED PROMOTIONSThere is much more that can be done on the Amazon Marketplace then just list a product to sell.
Today millions of customers are shopping on Amazon.com. Let us take our experience on the Amazon Marketplace and put your brand in the position to grow. We will help educate and raise awareness of your product by means of promotion.
Here are just a few of the many tools we use:

H5 Products works with the Amazon category teams to create promotions
Marketplace advertising campaign – we fight for the best placement
Increase product reviews – happy customers promote new customers
Cross promote – get a message in front of customers interested in a similar product

 






PREMIUM EXPERIENCE: CUSTOMERS EXPECT ITYou have spent years delivering your brands message of quality, and making sure your brands story is told to the millions of consumers that purchase on Amazon.com every day. With your support, H5 Products can deliver the experience consumers come to expect from your brand. We manually prep all product at our warehouse prior to it arriving at Amazon’s fulfillment centers, which ensures the brands message is consistently delivered the way you want it. It’s not easy, but the right way never is.
This may include clear poly bags, bubble bags, or any other type of protective packaging necessary to ensure that the customer receives their item clean and pristine.
Benefits of customers ordering from us on Amazon.com:

Customer perspective thinking to ensure 100% satisfaction
Product protected in every step of shipping to the customer.
Item not scratched , dirty, or littered with stickers or sticker residue.
Ensure clean, damage free delivery.
Better customer experience equals more customer reviews.
Better experience without the extra cost.

 
 


 





 











WHAT SETS US APART 


















 


MAP ENFORCEMENT


We are a huge advocate of MAP pricing and strongly encourage all of our partners to implement and enforce a MAP policy if they do not currently have one.  MAP enforcement is crucial to maintaining a premier brand status among customers and allows for equality among all retailers (both online and brick & mortar).  We make life easier by working with our partners by monitoring and identifying when and who is not abiding by their MAP agreements. 








 


PRODUCT REVIEWS


Products reviews are very important to the success of any brand as more and more consumers read product reviews prior to purchasing anything.  By monitoring product reviews for any trends or problems, we can coordinate with our partners to help identify what’s good, what’s not, and help resolve any quality issues so that they may be addressed and the product improved, resulting in an increase of sales and satisfaction.























 


LISTING OPTIMIZATION


Product listings with accurate content is very important to the success of any product as customers expect to receive an item that matches both the image(s) and product description.  Prior to listing any products, we analyze each listing to ensure a perfect match.  If anything is wrong or if anything changes, we have the knowledge to correct the listing and work with our partners to insure everything in their listing is accurate and relevant to protect the brand and ensure 100% customer satisfaction.  







 


PAYMENTS


100% of our partners enjoy 100% payment from us prior to shipping any of our purchases, which is how we think it should be.  Unlike many retailers, H5 Products is a healthy and profitable company, and we do not require any credit terms to purchase products.  This “Payment Up Front” approach allows a manufacturer to increase their cash flow, reduce their risk of not being paid by retailers, and free up more time to focus on more important goals of growing and expanding their company. 































 
 





OUR ONLINE STORESOur network of niche specific web stores and online marketplaces put your brands in front of thousands of new customers that have come to associate the H5 Products family of sites with premium quality products. 





 





 





 





 





OUR ADDITIONAL MARKETPLACESWe are an approved vendor with a variety of online marketplaces, which includes the ability to list your products places like Amazon, eBay, Rakuten.com, and Sears.com.  Best of all, we have maintained 100% Seller Feedback on all of our marketplace accounts; an accomplishment that we are very proud of and strive to maintain. 







 







 





"Finally, a company that cares about your brand as much as you do." 





 





BECOME A PARTNERSo you’re interested in telling us about some great new products you think would fit with one of our brands? Perfect! We’re always on the hunt for new products that match well with our brand and mission. Just fill out the form below, and we will be in touch!

Base machines: PONSSE Beaver, PONSSE Fox, PONSSE Scorpion, PONSSE ScorpionKing or track-based machine over 10 tons 





The PONSSE H5 harvester head brings the productivity of thinning to a completely new level. Working is fast and smooth and the design pays special attention to multi-stemming, in particular. Combined with a structure that facilitates easy maintenance, H5 truly meets the new requirements set by loggers.The PONSSE H5 harvester head is a general harvester head especially suited for efficient thinning. Its design pays special attention to smooth multi-stemming. The large opening, long front delimbing knives and the correctly placed wide top feed roller intensify thinning of single trees as well as collecting trunks during multi-stemming. The extremely fast yet economical feed and cutting guarantee high productivity under all operating conditions.Multi-stemming is performed efficiently with the PONSSE H5 harvester head without the need of optional equipment, which would only increase the weight as well as the need for maintenance. This way the crane capacity and reach, and the stability of the base machine, can be utilised fully to the most relevant function – the handling of trees. Multistemming is based on the automatic operating logic of the delimbing knives and feed rollers, which enables grabbing a new trunk with the delimbing knives while the feed rollers hold the trunks in place in the harvester head. Multi-stemming considerably speeds up harvesting without deteriorating the harvester head’s ability to handle single trunks.
