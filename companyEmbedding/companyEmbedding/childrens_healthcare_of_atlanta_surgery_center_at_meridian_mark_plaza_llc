Our Unique Approach                    





Evidence has shown that children do better when their surgical team specializes in caring for kids. Our team—including pediatric surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists—is specially trained and experienced in caring for children.
We perform more than 40,000 surgeries each year, from the most common outpatient procedures, to the most complex operations requiring specialized, multidisciplinary care.
Our hospital and surgical space is designed for children, from the colorful surroundings and pre-op playroom, to the child-sized blood pressure cuffs and other equipment and supplies.
Our anesthesiologists and pain management specialists know how to keep kids safe and comfortable in surgery and while they are healing. Because children lose fluids and heat more easily than adults, we make sure they stay hydrated with fluids and warm with special lights and blankets.
And we know the importance of keeping families at ease and informed. Whatever your child’s condition and needs, you will have the information and resources you need to feel confident caring for him after he goes home.





























Helpful Resources                    









Before surgery                    






Studies show that children cope better with medical procedures when they are well prepared ahead of time. Parents are better able to help their children when they are better prepared as well.
Listen to your child, let him talk about his fears, and answer his questions honestly. Show that you are confident in his safety and the surgery’s success, and make sure he knows sickness and treatment are not punishments.
If you have any concerns, talk to us before the day of surgery and away from your child. In most cases, a nurse will call you a day or two before the surgery to give you instructions. You may be asked to call ahead for instructions the day before the surgery. A child life specialist will be available to help your child relax on the day of surgery. If possible, arrange in advance for care of your other children on the day of surgery, so you can focus on the child in our care.
Pre-admission tour
To help prepare your child for his procedure, the Child Life department at Children's at Egleston and Children's at Scottish Rite offers pre-admission tours for those scheduled for medical procedures or surgeries. This service is provided by a child life specialist who is trained to help children and families cope with hospitalization and illness.

The tour before admission gives you and your child a chance to visit the hospital and see the sights, sounds and events you will experience the day of the procedure. 
The tour will give your child a chance to build trust, understand what is involved and gain control over the experience. It is a non-threatening way to learn about the hospital. 
Children are less scared when told what to expect and why. Pre-operative teaching can give your child the support that is needed. 
Parents and children over the age of 3 are welcome – as well as brothers and sisters over 3. 
Parents of children under the age of 3 are also invited; however, the tour is geared toward children over 3. 

To attend a pre-admission tour, contact:
Children's at Egleston: Ashley McClain, CCLS at 404-785-6325. 
Children's at Scottish Rite: Sarah Rodgers, CCLS at 404-785-4286. 
Preparing for an overnight stay
We have most of the things your child will need during his stay. Children’s provides diapers, hospital gowns and slipper socks. We have breast pumps for breastfeeding mothers, or you may bring your own. We also provide toys for your child’s age and video games.
Each of our private rooms includes a hide-a-bed sofa, bathroom, television and telephone, and each floor has a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. You can eat in our cafeteria or have meals delivered to your child’s room. Our locations also provide a business center, family library and chapel.
Make sure to bring:

All your child’s medicines in their prescription bottles
Comfort items from home, such as favorite clothes, a special toy or blanket
A pillow, pajamas or personal items for yourself if you plan to stay with your child (Your child will feel more secure with a parent or family member close by.)
Snacks from home if desired
Toiletries such as toothbrush and toothpaste















Day of surgery                    






Your child’s legal guardian must come to the hospital with your child, in order to sign papers allowing us to do the surgery.
Before walking out the door to go to the hospital, check to make sure you have:

A list of questions for the doctor or nurse
Any paperwork your child's doctor has given you
Your current insurance card
Your child's regular medicines in their prescription bottles
Your child's favorite blanket, stuffed animal, doll or book
A bottle or sippy cup if your child uses one
An extra pair of clothes for you and your child

If your child is having orthopaedic surgery on the upper (arm, wrist or shoulder) or lower (hips, leg, knee or foot) parts of his body, his doctor may provide instructions on what type of clothing to wear after surgery. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions on what clothing to wear after surgery.



Please add an extra 15 minutes to your commute for parking. And smile! Put your child at ease by showing your confidence, not your concerns.
Let us know right away if your child has had any signs of illness, such as fever, a cold, vomiting or diarrhea. Also let us know if he has been exposed to chickenpox, or if anyone in your household has been exposed to tuberculosis (TB). If you need to cancel, let us know as soon as possible so the surgery can be rescheduled.














Pre-anesthesia history forms                    






When your child is scheduled for surgery, you need to fill out a pre-anesthesia history form with health questions about your child. You can fill out this form in advance at home and save time. Choose the link for the location where your child is having surgery:

Egleston hospital pre-anesthesia history form
Scottish Rite hospital pre-anesthesia history form
Children's at Satellite Boulevard pre-anesthesia history form
Children's at Meridian Mark pre-anesthesia history form

Otolaryngology














Otolaryngology                                
                                

Children have many problems with their ears, nose, throat, head and neck. In fact, more than 80 percent will experience an ear infection by age 3. Depending on your child's situation, his doctor may refer him to an otolaryngologist.

What We Treat                    





Otolaryngologists, or ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, treat children with common childhood problems such as ear infections, hearing loss, breathing problems and sinus issues. Our ENT doctors may also be involved if your child needs ear tubes or a tonsillectomy. We also see children with tumors and masses of the head and neck. Some conditions we commonly treat include:






Ear                    







Cholesteatoma: a skin growth in the middle ear behind the ear drum
Hearing loss: which can slow learning and development
Mastoiditis: an infection of the mastoid bone just behind the ear
Otitis media: middle ear infection















Nose                    







Allergic rhinitis: seasonal nasal allergies
Deviated septum: when the cartilage that separates the nostrils is off-center
Rhinosinusitis: inflammation of the nasal passages and sinus cavities
Sinusitis: inflammation of the sinuses near the nose
Tumors: cancerous and noncancerous
Turbinate hypertrophy: an enlargement of the turbinates (the small structures within your nose that cleanse and humidify air as it passes through your nostrils)















Throat                    







Obstructive sleep apnea: when a child is unable to breathe clearly while asleep, usually because of a blockage
Swallowing disorders: difficulty or pain when swallowing, or the inability to swallow
Tonsil and adenoid enlargement and infections: which can lead to sleep apnea and other health problems
Tumors: cancerous and noncancerous















Airway                    







Abnormalities of the larynx (also called the voicebox): and trachea (also called the windpipe)
Disorders of the aerodigestive tract: the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract and the upper part of the digestive tract, including the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat, vocal cords, and part of the esophagus and windpipe
Laryngomalacia: floppy, soft tissue above the vocal cords that falls into the airway when a child breathes in
Stridor: a harsh, vibrating noise when breathing caused by partially blocked airways















Head and neck                    







Branchial cleft abnormality: mass of tissue in the neck
Dermoid cyst: pocket or sac under the skin that contains tissues normally present in the outer layers of the skin
Enlarged lymph nodes: swollen glands in the neck usually caused by infection, inflammation or disease
Infections and tumors of the parotid and submandibular gland: the salivary glands the keep your mouth moist
Thyroglossal duct cysts: a neck mass or lump that develops from cells and tissues remaining after the thyroid gland forms before birth
Tumors of the neck: cancerous and noncancerous

Our Unique Approach                    





Children often have problems of the ear, nose and throat that are rarely seen in adults. They respond differently to treatment and need an otolaryngology team with pediatric experience and training. Our pediatric ENT specialists are trained and experienced in treating children of all ages, from babies to young adults.
Each year, our team performs:

More than 5,000 ear tube surgeries
Thousands of tonsil and adenoid removal surgeries
Nearly 9,000 total ENT surgical procedures

Our staff also knows how to talk to kids and families and how to help put them at ease at times of stress. We will work closely with you and your child to find the best treatment options for his specific needs.

What to look for in a plastic surgeon
Plastic surgery is more popular than ever, and parents are often bombarded with confusing messages about their choices when seeking a plastic surgeon for their child. Many providers make extravagant claims, or offer deals that seem too good to be true. In the flood of information, it can be difficult to determine who to trust.
At Children’s, we believe these are some of the most important things that parents should look for in a plastic surgeon:

Board certification: The term “board certified” carries a great deal of weight in the medical profession, but when it’s misused it can often be misleading. The American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) is the only organization recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) for certifying plastic surgeons in the U.S. The ABPS helps to ensure that certified plastic surgeons adhere to the highest standards of patient care and safety.
Hospital privileges: Not all surgeons have privileges at pediatric hospitals; sometimes they perform procedures under less than optimal conditions. While certain procedures can be safely performed in an office setting, making sure that your plastic surgeon has privileges at an accredited pediatric hospital ensures that issues can be fully addressed appropriately, in a timely manner and in a child-friendly environment.
Experience and recognition: Often, the best way to determine the skill of a plastic surgeon is to find out how they are regarded by their peers and patients. Look for a doctor who is a member of highly regarded professional organizations, who has published articles in peer-reviewed medical journals, and who is sought out as an expert instructor in his field.

Plastic surgery is not something that should be taken lightly, especially when it comes to your child. Rest assured that all of our pediatric plastic surgeons are board certified in plastic surgery and have hospital privileges at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. At Children’s, a pediatric anesthesiologist is guaranteed for your child’s surgery.

Robot-assisted surgery can offer a faster recovery with less pain and scarring than conventional surgery. Children’s is the only hospital in Georgia with a robotic surgery program dedicated solely to children and teens.








Robot-assisted surgery can offer a faster recovery with less pain and scarring than conventional surgery. Children’s is the only hospital in Georgia with a robotic surgery program dedicated solely to children and teens.










What We Treat                    





Our robotics team works with other specialists to treat a wide range of conditions or disorders using robot-assisted surgery, a minimally invasive technique.





























Services We Offer                    





Our pediatric surgeons are specially trained in using robotics to perform intricate operations. such as:

Bladder neck sling: A procedure used to lift the urethra into a normal position and exert pressure on the urethra to aid urine retention
Cholecystectomy: The surgical removal of the gallbladder
Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE): A surgical procedure used to create a pathway near the anus that helps remove feces using enemas
Mitrofanoff: Uses the appendix to create a channel between the skin surface and the bladder
Nephrectomy: The surgical removal of a kidney
Pyeloplasty: Used to fix blockages between the kidneys and the ureter
Ureteral reimplantation: Used to treat urinary reflux of ureterovesical junction obstruction (UVJO)






























Our Unique Approach                    





Our robotic surgery team specializes in treating children and teens and is highly experienced in the most commonly performed robotic procedures. Our robot-assisted surgical system has a magnified, three-dimensional, high-definition vision system, using a camera attached to a small, flexible tube (an endoscope). The robot’s tiny wristed instruments bend and rotate, and are far more flexible than the human wrist. This technology enables the surgeon see even the smallest structures in great detail, and to operate with precision, dexterity and control.
Compared to conventional surgery, robot-assisted surgery can offer:

A shorter hospital stay
Less blood loss
Fewer complications
Less need for narcotic pain medicine
A faster recovery
Smaller cuts for less scarring

For children with vascular anomalies, few facilities can offer a comprehensive, coordinated approach in one location. Children’s is home to the only clinic of its kind in the Southeast and one of only a handful in the U.S.










What We Treat                    





For children with vascular anomalies, the number of facilities capable of providing comprehensive treatment is limited. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta is pleased to announce that we are now offering a Vascular Anomalies Clinic—becoming the only clinic of its kind in the Southeast and one of only a handful of centers in the country to offer this type of coordinated care.
Vascular anomalies occur when arteries, veins, capillaries or lymph vessels do not develop properly. Some can be disfiguring, and some can present health risks. Many vascular anomalies are congenital (present at birth), but others may develop later in a child’s life.






Vascular tumors                    







Infantile hemangiomas
Congenital hemangiomas
Tufted angioma
Birthmarks
Pyogenic granulomas
Hemangioendotheliomas 
Angiosarcoma
PTEN hamartoma















Vascular malformations                    







Venous malformations (abnormal veins)
Lymphatic malformations (abnormal lymph vessels)

Generalized lymphatic anomaly
Gorham-Stout disease


Arteriovenous malformations (abnormal arteries and veins)
Capillary malformations (port-wine stains, abnormal capillaries)
Arteriovenous fistulas
Primary lymphedema
Generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA)
Gorham-Stout disease
Complex combined malformations

CLOVES syndrome
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
PHACE syndrome
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)
Parkes-Weber syndrome
Proteus syndrome
Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)
Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome
Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
Maffucci syndrome








































Services We Offer                    





Our collaborative team of pediatric specialists work together to provide accurate diagnoses (which can be difficult for these complex conditions), individualized treatment plans and ongoing care for children with vascular anomalies. Our clinic offers:

Medications to control blood vessel growth
Image-guided sclerotherapy to shrink the lesion
Surgery to remove the tumor or lesion
Laser therapy
Clinical trials






























Our Unique Approach                    





Our Vascular Anomalies Clinic combines expertise and resources from across our healthcare system to offer effective, coordinated care. We will create a treatment and follow-up plan just for your child. Our surgeons are highly skilled and experienced in treating vascular malformations, and all our staff members including pediatric anesthesiologists, nurses and other professionals, are trained in working with children and teens.

Our clinic is the only clinic of its kind in the Southeast and one of only a few in the U.S.
We serve as a national referral center for children with vascular anomalies who might otherwise not have access to specialized care.
Children’s offers a convenient location for traveling families—80% of the U.S. population lives within a 2-hour direct flight from Atlanta.
We have one of the largest teams in the country—our clinic represents 16 different pediatric specialties

Children’s License Agreement


Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (“CHOA”) provides free access to certain materials and information, documentation, forms, questionnaires and diagrams relating to the study, prevention, and treatment of concussions via this website and its related pages, including without limitation, for your reference or download (collectively, the “Concussion Program Materials”) as described in this License agreement (“Agreement”).  By accessing the Concussion Program Materials, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1.	Right to Access and Use.  CHOA hereby provides you a fully-paid, nontransferable, nonexclusive, personal right and license to access, download, or otherwise use any Concussion Program Materials solely for the following purposes:

(i)	if you are accessing the materials as a parent, you may use the Concussion Program Materials for your personal, non-commercial use to educate yourself and your family on concussion prevention and treatment for a child; 

(ii)	if you are accessing the materials as an athletics coach or on behalf of a school organization, you may use the Concussion Program Materials to promote concussion safety to your staff, students and athletes and to create appropriate concussion management procedures; and 

(iii)	if you are a healthcare provider, you may use the Concussion Program Materials for your personal, professional development to enhance your medical knowledge in the field of concussions.  You acknowledge the Concussion Program Materials are not to be used as definitive diagnostic tools with any specific patient and your independent medical judgment will be used to treat any patient.

You must maintain all CHOA proprietary notices on the Concussion Program Materials. You may not copy, modify, adapt, reverse engineer or create derivative works of the Concussion Program Materials or remove any copyright or other proprietary rights notices therefrom.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where indicated in the Concussion Program Materials, schools and sports organizations  are permitted to co-brand certain of the Concussion Program Materials with CHOA’s prior written consent. Additionally, schools, sports programs and recreational leagues may put their own logo on the Concussion Policy and modify it to meet their needs. CHOA may update, replace or remove some or all of the Concussion Program Materials from time to time, and you should check back with the website to determine if the Concussion Program Materials you downloaded are current.

2.	Reservation of Rights.  Except for the limited license provided to you in Section 1 of this Agreement, no express or implied license, right, or ownership interest of any kind is granted to you with respect to any of the Concussion Program Materials or any copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights therein.  CHOA reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.

3.	Disclaimer of Medical Advice.  The Concussion Program Materials do not constitute specific medical advice and are provided as information resources only.  The Concussion Program Materials do not create a patient-physician relationship and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice and treatment from a licensed doctor.  In the case of a concern, a medical professional should be consulted.  In the event of an emergency, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately.  By licensing the Concussion Program Materials, CHOA is not assuming any duty to update the Concussion Program Materials, and you are responsible for reviewing and approving the Concussion Program Materials for your use. 

4.	No Warranties.  While CHOA makes efforts to provide materials that accurately reflect the research and information CHOA is authorized to make available publicly, THE CONCUSSION PROGRAM AND ALL RELATED MATERIALS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND CHOA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  

5.	Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL CHOA OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OF CHOA OR ITS AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS OF GOODWILL OR PROFIT IN ANY WAY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MATERIALS, HEREUNDER, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN ANY EVENT, THE LIABILITY OF CHOA AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CHOA AND ITS AFFILIATES, FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. 

6.	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia of the United States of America, without regard to its rules regarding conflicts of law.

7.	General.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior understanding or agreement respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.  You irrevocably waive any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Concussion Program Materials.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

I felt like it was 4pm at 11am.  To cut a long story short, the diet that they put me on, my weekly routine along with the supplements that they prescribed have drastically helped my health.  It was a combination of leaky gut,  gluten reaction and an exhausted thyroid that were the cause.  Overall, the staff was very kind and receptive and the doctors answered my questions very professionally and knowledgeably.   Its a well rounded approach, you also see a dietitian as part of the process.  In my case i had a LOT of blood work, stool tests and a saliva tests that revealed a great deal of information to help me with my condition.I would give this place 5 stars, if it wasn't for the cost.  You wont spend about 3K+ out of pocket like some of the other places that are as reputable or similar (my opinion after reading other peoples reviews on the facilities i researched), but you might have to pay about half that much(in my case)...this might be more or less depending on what they are treating.  This is the amount out of pocket (After insurance had kicked in).  Did they warn me about the cost on the first visit....YES....do i regret the amount that i have to pay(i have a 12 month payment plan).... NO.  When your health starts affecting your job, relationships, and confidence(memory loss), it put a different perspective on how much i was willing to pay.   Most importantly, i can remember stuff far better than i have in years and i cant put a price on that!If you have a short term disease, injury (flu, sprained acl) then this might not be the best place for you.  But if you have a chronic disease, then I would highly recommend these guys!  They really know what they are talking about.Progressive Medical Centerchris.spurgeon.7 ratedThank God for Progessive Medical. I had been to over 30 different doctors over the course of 2 years and was told by each that I either had nothing wrong with me, my ailments were all in my head or that they couldn't do anything for me and I would live out the rest of my life in pain and confusion.  My wife had heard about Progressive and decided to do the new patient tour without me (as I was bed ridden by this time) and returned home excited.  I could tell from the first appointment with the doctor that this place was different from any other I had been to.  They listened to what I had to say, looked me in the eye as I was talking, and didn't rush me out so they could get to their next appointment.  I was immediately given a treatment plan that was adjusted as my condition required.  After 2 years of searching for an answer, I was given one by Progressive Medical!  In 3 short months I was driving again!  I continued to improve under their care and haven't looked back since.  This place is super comprehensive, so at first it does seem confusing because all that is going on inside one building.  (Which is another great attribute.  You don't have to drive all over town to see different doctors and get different treatments.)  I hate to think what my life would be like today if my wife hadn't taken that patient tour and insisted I go.    They gave my wife her husband back, my kids their father, and me my life! Progressive Medical Centerkaywell ratedDO NOT go if  you have Cancer!!! Great place to go to help Restore your Immune System but Do Not Go if  you have Cancer!!!Was excited and had such high hopes after meeting  with Dr Bouquette and Dr Agolli. Extensive testing was done to identify immune system deficiencies. Began Jan 2, 2013 on a 30 day detox, with lots of supplements purchased (additional costs above treatment amount)  and given diet restrictions for that time frame.But at the end on the 30 days there was NO Strategy going forward to address fighting the cancer. I had to call several times to ask ..What now??  Never met with Oncologist on staff or any other staff relating to or regarding my cancer!!!   Got scheduled to see a doctor 3 weeks later to go over test results and then after another  month and a half was told  to go have surgery.    By then the tumor and cancer around it had grown.    The Oncologist that was on staff has retired and there appears to be no true staff to provide services or strategies to help you if you have cancer. DO NOT go if  you have Cancer!  If you are looking for an integrated effort of building your immune system with a definitive fighting of  cancer strategy ... I would not suggest Progressive.Grady Memorial HospitalLori B. ratedThings have really changed over at Grady in the past few years. They are in the process of building a brand new Emergency Department Tower that will relieve the insane congestion of the current tiny ER that so many have experienced. The doctors at Grady are from Emory and Morehouse so you are getting the best of the best. Some of the floors have been completely renovated but I can assure you that the equipment and the staff are of the highest quality. Yes, Grady treats a lot of gun shot victims, but you wanna know what? Those people walk out of Grady as well. Grady has 2 helicopter pads on the roof that all day receive patients that are too critical to be assigned to just any hospital in Atlanta. If I had to trust my life to ANY hospital in the greater Atlanta area, I would choose Grady!Progressive Medical CenterJackie L. ratedIf you are looking for an alternative to standard medical treatment this is the place.  Each staff person was very attentive during their visit with me.  Exceptional service, a quality facility and a wonderful atmosphere to be restored back to health.  I came into the facility "dragging my leg" and unable to put weight on my foot due to a tear in my tendon and two sprains in my right knee.  After only one "pain management treatment", I was able to walk out of the facility walking on my foot.  Dr. Mike Gramazio is wonderful in administering pain management - he definitely has the "magic touch" (blessed hands).  My visit and satisfaction with Progressive Medical is certainly deserving of not only five stars but ten!!!Progressive Medical CenterShineka M. ratedPMC and the staff members have been very attentive  and they are very caring and informative.  I have been treated for conditions that my traditional doctors do not even care to acknowledge that may be the underline cause for my heart condition, such as leaky gut and mercury poisoning .  PMC is trying to find a solution opposed to just treating symptoms.   Overall,  my health has improved.  I also enjoy going to the Pain Management  department  and trying their alternative methods of treatment.  When I leave a session, I am energized and more alert.  I recommend trying the hyperbaric chamber!  Awesome experience so far!   Hypnosis 2 Changemaestro2002 ratedI was a smoker with huge anxiety problem for over 30 years. After spending two sessions with Alisa I am now a non smoker. And 6 sessions later I have my anxiety under control and I don't have panic attacks at work anymore. It has now been eight weeks since I have had a cigarette. I only wish I had have done this sooner. Thank you Alisa and Hypnois 2 Change for all of your help and support. I Highly Recommended for anyone who is ready to quit smoking or dealing with anxiety to see Alisa.West End Discount Pharmacynatalia125 ratedThis is the place to go for yo...This is the place to go for your prescriptions. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful. They had my drugs ready in less than 15 minutes. While waiting I was able to get passport picture for me and my son. They only charge $6.99 and they came out great. What I didn't know is that they deliver prescriptions for free. You can't beat that. They will pick up the prescriptions, fill them and deliver them back to you. WOW!Progressive Medical CenterAmy C. ratedI went to Progressive Medical when I had a six week long headache that didn't seem to have an end in sight. I have now been totally headache free for two weeks. My skin looks amazing! I have recurrent corneal erosions in both eyes that have not bothered me for the past month. I have a much more positive outlook and I am very grateful for all the support and direction from Progressive Medical.MinuteClinicG L. ratedIf you or your kid suddenly does not feel well, but you dont want to rush to the doctor office, minute clinic on North Highland is for you. The personnel at this location is very knowledgeable and provides a  professional opinion. If more serious intervention is required they will send you to see a doctor. The waiting time is reasonable and the pharmacy is right there!

Our Unique Approach                    





Evidence has shown that children do better when their surgical team specializes in caring for kids. Our team—including pediatric surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists—is specially trained and experienced in caring for children.
We perform more than 40,000 surgeries each year, from the most common outpatient procedures, to the most complex operations requiring specialized, multidisciplinary care.
Our hospital and surgical space is designed for children, from the colorful surroundings and pre-op playroom, to the child-sized blood pressure cuffs and other equipment and supplies.
Our anesthesiologists and pain management specialists know how to keep kids safe and comfortable in surgery and while they are healing. Because children lose fluids and heat more easily than adults, we make sure they stay hydrated with fluids and warm with special lights and blankets.
And we know the importance of keeping families at ease and informed. Whatever your child’s condition and needs, you will have the information and resources you need to feel confident caring for him after he goes home.

Before surgery                    






Studies show that children cope better with medical procedures when they are well prepared ahead of time. Parents are better able to help their children when they are better prepared as well.
Listen to your child, let him talk about his fears, and answer his questions honestly. Show that you are confident in his safety and the surgery’s success, and make sure he knows sickness and treatment are not punishments.
If you have any concerns, talk to us before the day of surgery and away from your child. In most cases, a nurse will call you a day or two before the surgery to give you instructions. You may be asked to call ahead for instructions the day before the surgery. A child life specialist will be available to help your child relax on the day of surgery. If possible, arrange in advance for care of your other children on the day of surgery, so you can focus on the child in our care.
Pre-admission tour
To help prepare your child for his procedure, the Child Life department at Children's at Egleston and Children's at Scottish Rite offers pre-admission tours for those scheduled for medical procedures or surgeries. This service is provided by a child life specialist who is trained to help children and families cope with hospitalization and illness.

The tour before admission gives you and your child a chance to visit the hospital and see the sights, sounds and events you will experience the day of the procedure. 
The tour will give your child a chance to build trust, understand what is involved and gain control over the experience. It is a non-threatening way to learn about the hospital. 
Children are less scared when told what to expect and why. Pre-operative teaching can give your child the support that is needed. 
Parents and children over the age of 3 are welcome – as well as brothers and sisters over 3. 
Parents of children under the age of 3 are also invited; however, the tour is geared toward children over 3. 

To attend a pre-admission tour, contact:
Children's at Egleston: Ashley McClain, CCLS at 404-785-6325. 
Children's at Scottish Rite: Sarah Rodgers, CCLS at 404-785-4286. 
Preparing for an overnight stay
We have most of the things your child will need during his stay. Children’s provides diapers, hospital gowns and slipper socks. We have breast pumps for breastfeeding mothers, or you may bring your own. We also provide toys for your child’s age and video games.
Each of our private rooms includes a hide-a-bed sofa, bathroom, television and telephone, and each floor has a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. You can eat in our cafeteria or have meals delivered to your child’s room. Our locations also provide a business center, family library and chapel.
Make sure to bring:

All your child’s medicines in their prescription bottles
Comfort items from home, such as favorite clothes, a special toy or blanket
A pillow, pajamas or personal items for yourself if you plan to stay with your child (Your child will feel more secure with a parent or family member close by.)
Snacks from home if desired
Toiletries such as toothbrush and toothpaste















Day of surgery                    






Your child’s legal guardian must come to the hospital with your child, in order to sign papers allowing us to do the surgery.
Before walking out the door to go to the hospital, check to make sure you have:

A list of questions for the doctor or nurse
Any paperwork your child's doctor has given you
Your current insurance card
Your child's regular medicines in their prescription bottles
Your child's favorite blanket, stuffed animal, doll or book
A bottle or sippy cup if your child uses one
An extra pair of clothes for you and your child

If your child is having orthopaedic surgery on the upper (arm, wrist or shoulder) or lower (hips, leg, knee or foot) parts of his body, his doctor may provide instructions on what type of clothing to wear after surgery. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions on what clothing to wear after surgery.



Please add an extra 15 minutes to your commute for parking. And smile! Put your child at ease by showing your confidence, not your concerns.
Let us know right away if your child has had any signs of illness, such as fever, a cold, vomiting or diarrhea. Also let us know if he has been exposed to chickenpox, or if anyone in your household has been exposed to tuberculosis (TB). If you need to cancel, let us know as soon as possible so the surgery can be rescheduled.














Pre-anesthesia history forms                    






When your child is scheduled for surgery, you need to fill out a pre-anesthesia history form with health questions about your child. You can fill out this form in advance at home and save time. Choose the link for the location where your child is having surgery:

Egleston hospital pre-anesthesia history form
Scottish Rite hospital pre-anesthesia history form
Children's at Satellite Boulevard pre-anesthesia history form
Children's at Meridian Mark pre-anesthesia history form
