Low latency trading: growing local participation

Hong Kong, April 2017 - Mr. Govert Heijboer, Co-CIO of True Partner Capital joined the 24th FOW’s Derivative World Asia Conference where the was invited as member of the panel discussion about low latency trading.
FOW Derivative World Asia has returned to Hong Kong for the region's largest derivatives conference. There are over 650 delegates to hear the latest thinking on the Asian derivatives markets. It is an exclusive opportunity for the participants to network with key industry figures in the Asian and global derivatives trading community.
Asia the new focus of Low Latency trading firms

The panel discussed the subject "Low latency trading: growing local participation". Low latency or high-frequency trading is increasingly recognized as a key component of a modern market. The number of international firms setting up operations in Asia is on the rise once again after a few years of contraction but the emergence of local HFT remains muted. This should change as the costs of entry to all but the lowest latencies are falling.

The discussion points of this panel:

How are regional exchanges looking to work with international market makers?
What is behind the re-emergence of international low latency firms in Asia?
How can Asian trading firms grow their low latency businesses

A selection of other subjects discussed during the conference:


The new normal? Trading global markets in an age of protectionism
Currency derivatives: managing risk in an age of volatility and reform
Commodities: embracing volatility and the return of price inflation?
ETFs: growing liquidity in Asian markets
Asset management: evolving to deal with new challenges
New bilateral margining rules and their impact on the listed markets

OUR MISSION
By actively trading listed derivatives, with round-the-clock coverage of all major global financial markets, True Partner Capital strives to generate uncorrelated returns for its clients and investors, with an emphasis on outperformance in times of market turmoil.
As such, we strongly believe volatility should be treated as a separate asset class, allowing for improved risk/reward characteristics of investment portfolios.





TEAM AND TECHNOLOGY
True Partner Capital is a team of former market makers and IT specialists that have been working together for more than 15 years. 
Their combined expertise on trading, execution and risk management as well as the proprietary trading technology, allows the team to identify and capitalize on trading opportunities.







FUNDS AND MANAGED ACCOUNTS
The True Partner Fund (inception July 2011) applies an active global volatility arbitrage investment strategy, aiming to generate uncorrelated returns by using a volatility neutral approach. The True Partner Volatility Master Fund (inception September 2016) utilizes a similar methodology to identify underpriced and overpriced volatility, but applies an overall long volatility bias. As a result, this fund would be expected to generate more negatively correlated returns.
Besides these funds, True Partner Capital can also provide specifically engineered solutions for investors looking to optimize the risk/reward profile of their overall portfolio.

True Capital Closes $5M Fund For Retail And Consumer Startups Put Through Its TrueStart Accelerator

New Transportation And Energy Accelerator To Run In Berlin And SF












Last month True Capital Partners launched TrueStart, an “innovation hub” based in central London targeting retail and consumer startups across Europe. The rolling 6 month accelerator — teams can apply at any time — aims to put 20 startups through its program each year, who receive mentoring from TrueStart’s team of entrepreneurs, along with legal, accounting and recruitment support, and access to its retail and consumer sector network.
TrueStart founder and True Capital partner Matt Truman was previously Global Head of Retail for Lehman Brothers, and then Head of European Retail at JP Morgan, and its TrueStart’s ability to tap into those retail networks that he says differentiates it from more general accelerators and incubators.
Today, however, the retail and consumer-focused accelerator gets another shot in the arm with the announcement that True Capital has closed a $5 million seed fund to help fuel growth for the startups put through the TrueStart program. In other words, TrueStart is now a physical incubator underpinned by a formal fund, a move Truman tells me is designed to “take an entrepreneur all the way from seed to being a multi-million pound company, knowing the funding is there if they are successful.”
“What we’re trying to do with the hub is take the young innovators, the future leaders, and connect them with the big retailers and consumer products businesses who actually are struggling to be innovative because of their size,” says Truman. “We’re trying to get everybody in the same room, trying to knock down the same doors, so they can all benefit from that expertise but also put a fund around it.”
In terms of the type of deal-flow the TrueStart program is seeking, it says it’s on the hunt for early-stage startups with products, technologies or services that are targeted at disrupting any aspect of the retail and consumer landscape. Examples cited include in-store technology, social commerce, data analytics for retailers, or a new brand or consumer product.
Three startups are already being accelerated by TrueStart and are housed in its 4,500 square foot space in London’s Victoria. “One is a wearables technology business, one is a new e-commerce play, and the third one is effectively a crowdsourcing opinion app,” explains Truman.
For those accepted into the program, terms are flexible but typically include a cash investment of between £25-50k, for on average 10 per cent equity, valuing each startup between half and three quarters of a million pounds.
