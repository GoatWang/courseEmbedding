High-performers see opportunities where others see threats
The high-performing group of respondents takes a very different view on how to drive retail growth. High-performers, representing just under one-third of all survey respondents, are those organizations that ranked their performance “significantly above” or “somewhat above” their competitors’ on three metrics: same-store sales growth, margin and inventory turn rates.
High-performers have quite different perceptions of which trends are most important and, crucially, whether these trends offer opportunities or should be considered threats. For example, 69% of high-performers who see globalization as an important trend also see it as an opportunity, while only 43% of lower performers do so.







A challenging and changing landscape shifts executive priorities
The survey’s C-level retail executives considered increased globalization, increased security risks (such as from cyber attacks), shifting consumer tastes and global marketplaces to be the most powerful shifts in industry dynamics over the next three years.
Globalization itself isn’t news, but digital commerce has accelerated its effects on retailers by reducing the traditional cost, complexity and even importance of physical locations. Under Armour, for example, expects to have 30 different e-commerce experiences covering 80% of their key markets around the world by 2018.







Executives go back to the basics for differentiation
Despite the disruption caused by these trends, many retail leaders stress the importance of focusing on the basics. The survey showed that 60% of senior retail executives view product excellence (defined as high-quality, unique or innovative products) as the most important differentiator in the current environment, while 53% view seamless service (defined as high quality service or service across channels) as such.

Mobile is First in Traffic
2016 ushered in the next wave of digital shopping, as phones for the first time drove more traffic globally than any other device in the first quarter. Phones now hold 45% traffic share globally. This milestone is not the apex. Retailers can expect to see more than 60% of traffic from phones by the end of 2017. Mobile-obsessed millennials and Gen Z are driving this shift, and brands that appeal to this demographic serve as harbingers for the broader market by attracting a much higher share of traffic from phones.







Unifying Commerce Through the Shopping Basket
Shoppers have adopted the cart as their new wish list. In just the last year, shoppers created 70% more carts on phones, thanks in part to a 17% increase in ‘add to cart’ rate on phones. Meanwhile, only 3% more carts were created on tablets and computers combined. A recent survey from Bronto found that 73% of online shoppers use the shopping cart to store items to buy later.







Best Practices for Organizing Around Mobile
The impact of mobile on the organization can range from minor additional work to major transformation, depending on how well the potential of mobile is leveraged. At its simplest, an optimized mobile channel requires tailored page layouts to be developed and managed, more image sizes to be produced and additional QA to be done for every site modification. This puts additional day-to-day burden on content production, web operations and merchandising. However, most retailers would also implement a tailored mobile user experience, which requires specialist UX design and management.

The Exponential Rate of Retail Disruption
Not only is the scale of change massive; more people now own a mobile phone than do a television; it is occurring at an exponential rate: each wave of disruption — from the Internet to smartphones to social media — achieving mass adoption quicker than the one before it.
Retailers are faced with a humbling corollary of this phenomenon — even as they transform to catch-up with the forces in play today, tomorrow presents an even steeper curve. Those that build capabilities and competitive advantage early will hold a significant edge over those that play catch-up.







Action Roadmap for Retailers
The new world order of retail demands that retailers transform how, where and when they engage with shoppers. The breadth and depth of change they need to drive is daunting — from organizational culture to business processes, technology architecture to customer engagement strategy. It is critical, therefore, for retailers to have a razor-sharp focus on specific aspects of the transformation that can deliver the greatest impact on revenue, cost-efficiencies and customer stickiness.

For maximum impact, wrap your items with a printed image or logo that sums up your business. To stay fresh in the minds of prospective clients, imprint your company's slogan or contact information on your closeout products. Once you're ready to purchase, simply choose your desired quantity and await your game-changing shipment.

Building a Website Has Never Been Easier
Create the perfect site with powerful drag and drop tools.













The Drag and Drop Editor
Weebly’s drag and drop website builder makes it easy to create a powerful, professional website without any technical skills. Over 40 million entrepreneurs and small businesses have already used Weebly to build their online presence with a website, blog or store.










Power Your Site with Elements
Content elements (like text, photos, maps, and videos) are added to your website by simply dragging and dropping them into place. Text is edited just like in a word processor. Building your website is done in real-time, right from your web browser. There's absolutely nothing to install and no upgrades to worry about.




Additional Features


Video Backgrounds
Impress your visitors with high quality video backgrounds. Choose from Weebly's free video library or upload your own unique video to make header images and sections stand out. Video backgrounds give your website a sense of energy and dynamism that helps impress visitors and sets your site apart from the competition.
Custom Headers
Drag and drop slideshows, videos and dynamic content into your website header to create a memorable experience for visitors with a fully customizable header. With custom headers you have the flexibility to build impactful pages that drive sales and keep your audience engaged.
Full Width Image and Color Backgrounds
Create unique, modern designs with the customizable image and color backgrounds. Every full width section you drag and drop onto your page works like its own mini-site and can contain multiple design elements like color backgrounds, text, images and video. These new elements allow you to add more variety and customization by stacking independent sections into your page layout.

National Commerce Corporation Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering of Common Stock - Stock Prices at $19.50 Per Share
BIRMINGHAM, AL (March 18, 2015) – National Commerce Corporation (“NCC”), the parent company of National Bank of Commerce, announced today the pricing of its initial public offering of
        1,700,000 shares of its common stock, including 1,642,000 shares sold by NCC and 58,000 shares sold by a selling stockholder, at a public offering price of $19.50 per share, resulting in aggregate
        gross proceeds of $33.15 million. NCC has also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase
        up to an additional 255,000 shares. The shares are expected to begin trading on Thursday, March 19,
        2015, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “NCOM.” 
NCC expects to receive net proceeds, before offering expenses, of approximately $29.86 million, which it intends to use to support growth, for working capital and for other general corporate
        purposes.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering. Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. and FIG Partners, LLC are acting as co-
        managers for the offering.
The registration statement relating to these securities was declared effective as of March 18, 2015 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The offering is being made only by means of the
        written prospectus forming part of the registration statement. Copies of the final prospectus relating to the offering, when available, may be obtained from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company,

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall
        there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
        would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Mobile is First in Traffic
2016 ushered in the next wave of digital shopping, as phones for the first time drove more traffic globally than any other device in the first quarter. Phones now hold 45% traffic share globally. This milestone is not the apex. Retailers can expect to see more than 60% of traffic from phones by the end of 2017. Mobile-obsessed millennials and Gen Z are driving this shift, and brands that appeal to this demographic serve as harbingers for the broader market by attracting a much higher share of traffic from phones.







Unifying Commerce Through the Shopping Basket
Shoppers have adopted the cart as their new wish list. In just the last year, shoppers created 70% more carts on phones, thanks in part to a 17% increase in ‘add to cart’ rate on phones. Meanwhile, only 3% more carts were created on tablets and computers combined. A recent survey from Bronto found that 73% of online shoppers use the shopping cart to store items to buy later.







Best Practices for Organizing Around Mobile
The impact of mobile on the organization can range from minor additional work to major transformation, depending on how well the potential of mobile is leveraged. At its simplest, an optimized mobile channel requires tailored page layouts to be developed and managed, more image sizes to be produced and additional QA to be done for every site modification. This puts additional day-to-day burden on content production, web operations and merchandising. However, most retailers would also implement a tailored mobile user experience, which requires specialist UX design and management.

High-performers see opportunities where others see threats
The high-performing group of respondents takes a very different view on how to drive retail growth. High-performers, representing just under one-third of all survey respondents, are those organizations that ranked their performance “significantly above” or “somewhat above” their competitors’ on three metrics: same-store sales growth, margin and inventory turn rates.
High-performers have quite different perceptions of which trends are most important and, crucially, whether these trends offer opportunities or should be considered threats. For example, 69% of high-performers who see globalization as an important trend also see it as an opportunity, while only 43% of lower performers do so.







A challenging and changing landscape shifts executive priorities
The survey’s C-level retail executives considered increased globalization, increased security risks (such as from cyber attacks), shifting consumer tastes and global marketplaces to be the most powerful shifts in industry dynamics over the next three years.
Globalization itself isn’t news, but digital commerce has accelerated its effects on retailers by reducing the traditional cost, complexity and even importance of physical locations. Under Armour, for example, expects to have 30 different e-commerce experiences covering 80% of their key markets around the world by 2018.







Executives go back to the basics for differentiation
Despite the disruption caused by these trends, many retail leaders stress the importance of focusing on the basics. The survey showed that 60% of senior retail executives view product excellence (defined as high-quality, unique or innovative products) as the most important differentiator in the current environment, while 53% view seamless service (defined as high quality service or service across channels) as such.
