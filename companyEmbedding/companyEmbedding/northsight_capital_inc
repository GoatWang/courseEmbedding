	NORTHSIGHT CAPITAL, INC.






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017









	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION






	Northsight Capital Inc. (Northsight or the Company) is an early stage company incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2008. In May, 2011, Safe Communications, Inc. (n/k/a Kuboo, Inc.) acquired 80% of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock, and, as a result, became its parent company. On June 25, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 7,500 cannabis related Internet domain names, in exchange for which the Company issued 78.5 million shares of its common stock and a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000. As a result of this transaction, the seller of the domain names became an 81% stockholder of the Company. Kuboo, Inc. continues to be a significant stockholder of the Company. John Venners, a director of Kuboo, Inc., is our EVP, Operations and also sits on our board of directors. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions.





	The Companys principal business is to provide a wide variety of online directories for a broad range of businesses engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and hemp related products. The following constitute the Companys major product categories: a monthly listing in one or more of the Companys online directories, paid advertising in one or more of the Companys online directories and leasing to customers one or more Internet domain names for the customers exclusive use.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the period.





	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The results of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.






	NOTE 2  LIQUIDITY/GOING CONCERN






	The Company had a net loss of $201,756 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, has accumulated losses of $20,885,166 and has had consistent negative cash flows from operating activities since inception (May 2008). These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 the Company received a net $62,211 in loans from related party shareholders to fund operations. Management plans to (i) raise additional capital as soon as possible, to fund continued operations of the Company and (ii) continue its efforts to generate revenues and income from operations.


	 


	In the event the Company does not generate sufficient funds from revenues or financing through the issuance of its common stock or from debt financing, the Company will be unable to fully implement its business plan and pay its obligations as they become due, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to recover the value of its assets or satisfy its liabilities.






	NOTE 3  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	Management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.






	6

















	NOTE 4  INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE






	On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Tumbleweed Holdings, Inc. (TW), pursuant to which a newly formed joint venture company is developing an online dating service around the URL, www.jointlovers.com. The Company and TW own 60% and 40% respectively of equity of the joint venture company. Under the joint venture agreement, the Company and TW agreed as follows:





	·


	The Company contributed the URL www.jointlovers.com to the joint venture entity, in exchange for 60% of the joint venture company.





	·


	TW contributed $30,000 and agreed to contribute an additional $70,000 towards the development of the online web portal, in exchange for 40% of the joint venture company. With any additional funds required for development to be contributed 60% by the Company and 40% by TW (see Note 17  Subsequent Events).





	·


	Revenue from the joint venture company will be shared proportionally with a portion of operating income to be used to repay principal and income due under the convertible notes referenced below (up to $165,000 in principal amount of notes).





	·


	TW agreed to purchase an aggregate of $150,000 in principal amount of convertible notes, convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $.20 per share. In addition to repayment of principal, if the joint venture company has revenues, the notes are entitled to receive a portion of the joint venture companys operating income until they have received an amount equal to 50% of the face value of the notes (see Note 17  Subsequent Events).





	During the year ended December 31, 2016, Tumbleweed contributed a total of $85,000 to the joint venture company. Tumbleweed has not contributed the remaining $15,000 as of the date of these financial statements.





	Additionally, both parties agreed to issue the other a warrant to purchase 4.9% of their outstanding common stock. Pursuant to this agreement, TW agreed to issue a warrant to the Company to purchase 9,770,878 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share, and the Company agreed to issue a warrant to TW to purchase 5,525,318 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $0.08 per share, valued at $475,751. The warrants have a three-year term and a cashless exercise right (see Note 5  Securities and Note 12  Stock Warrants for details). As of the date of these financial statements, TW has not yet issued the warrants due to the Company. Therefore, the Company has not yet recorded their value on its balance sheet.







	The Companys ownership of the joint venture company is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 323. Under the equity method of accounting, an Investee Companys accounts are not reflected within the Companys Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations; however, the Companys share of the earnings or losses of the Investee Company is reflected as a gain or loss on the Companys investment. Additionally, under the equity method of accounting, the Companys initial investment in the joint venture company was recorded at the historic cost basis of the contributed domain of $0. Accordingly, the Company expensed $475,751 related to the value of warrants the Company issued and is included as a component of loss on investments in the Companys Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	When the Companys carrying value in an equity method Investee Company is reduced to zero, no further losses are recorded in the Companys financial statements unless the Company guaranteed obligations of the Investee Company or has committed additional funding. When the Investee Company subsequently reports income, the Company will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the joint venture did not have a net income or loss. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the joint venture company experienced a net loss attributable to the Companys 60% ownership of $1,326 which was not recorded as an adjustment to the Companys investment account due to the Company having a zero book value in the investment.





	As of March 31, 2017, Tumbleweed was in default under the terms of the joint venture agreement and owed the joint venture company the remaining $15,000 in development funding and the Company $50,000 for the final note purchase, both of which were due by April 29, 2016. Additionally, Tumbleweed owes the joint venture company $18,904, representing its 40% share of costs in excess of the first $100,000.





	On August 15, 2016, the Company instituted a legal action in Arizona against, Tumbleweed Holdings Inc., (TW). The complaint alleged that (i) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund the remaining $15,000 due to the joint venture company by April 29, 2016, (ii) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund the last $50,000 convertible note due to the Company by April 29, 2016, and (iii) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund their respective 40% of development expense in excess of the initial $100,000. The Company seeks damages in the amount of $128,000 plus interest.






	7



















	On September 22, 2016, Tumbleweed Holdings Inc., instituted a counterclaim in Arizona in response to the above legal action. The complaint alleged that (i) The Company breached the joint venture agreement by failing to leverage relationships and failing to provide budgeting and accounting records, (ii) the Company breached implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by enticing TW into making significant contributions and then failing to perform under the agreement, (iii) the Company was unjustly enriched by having use of funds contributed by TW, (iv) the Company converted funds contributed by TW into its own assets, and (v) the Company has not provided accounting for all funds received by TW. TW seeks damages in the amount to be determined at trial. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against them.





	Summary revenue information on the joint venture for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

	NOTE 5  SECURITIES






	In conjunction with the formation of the joint venture discussed in Note 4, Tumbleweed Holdings agreed to issue the Company a warrant to purchase up to 9,770,878 shares of Tumbleweed Holdings, Inc. at an exercise price of $0.02 with an expiration date three years from the date of issuance. At March 31, 2017, Tumbleweed had not yet issued these warrants to the Company. The Company will record the value of these warrants on its balance sheet once they are received.






	NOTE 6  WEB DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND DOMAIN NAMES ASSETS






	In accordance with ASC 350-50, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not capitalize any expenses towards the development of multiple websites on which third parties can advertise the sale and distribution of cannabis related products and services: an online yellow pages. The Company does not intend to engage in the sale or distribution of marijuana or related products. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded website development expenses of $2,218 and $6,975, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the Companys consolidated statements of operations.





	The Company amortizes these assets over their related useful lives (approximately 1 to 5 years), using a straight-line basis. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, or at least annually. Measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between the assets carrying value and estimated fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including market and income approaches as considered necessary. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded amortization expense of $18,091 related to websites previously launched.

	NOTE 9  NOTES PAYABLE RELATED PARTY






	On May 19, 2015, the Company issued Kae Yong Park and her spouse Howard Baer (together, Park) a non-interest bearing, unsecured demand promissory note to evidence all unpaid advances received by the Company to that point and to cover all additional advances received afterward. Unpaid principal under the note is due and payable upon the earlier of (i) an event of default (as defined), (ii) written demand and (iii) the Companys receipt of capital (to the extent of net proceeds received) from any capital raising transaction after May 15, 2015, whether in the form of debt, equity or otherwise.





	On September 30, 2015, the Company amended and restated its promissory note to Park to include all advances to date and provide certain assets, including all internet domain names, websites and related assets as collateral. Repayment terms remain the same, and Park has to date not enforced the provision requiring repayment upon receipt of net proceeds from capital raising transactions.





	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Park advanced an aggregate of $36,400 on an unsecured basis to the Company for short-term capital needs. During this period, the Company also repaid $7,550 of its secured debt to Park and recaptured $35,938 worth of payroll expenses for Parks use of Company personnel. Amounts recaptured for use of Company personnel have been treated as repayments on the Companys Statements of Cash Flows. At March 31, 2017, the Company had a note payable to Park for these advances of $1,407,579 which is secured by the assets of the Company. Due to the on demand nature of this amount, the company has classified it as a current liability.

	NOTE 13  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE






	Net earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period.


	 


	Since the Company reflected a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents, if exercisable, would have been anti-dilutive. Therefore, a separate computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is not presented.


	 


	The Company has the following common stock equivalents as of March 31, 2017:

	NOTE 17  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	We have evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when our financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported. Management has determined that other than as disclosed below, there were no additional reportable subsequent events to be disclosed.







	Loan Advances







	Since March 31, 2017, Kae Yong Park, a significant shareholder, and her spouse, Howard R. Baer, made additional unsecured advances to the Company of $10,250, leaving a balance due of $1,417,829 at May 15, 2017. These advances are secured by all of the Companys assets, including all of its internet domain names, websites and related assets, and are payable on demand. Of the aggregate $1,417,829 owed at May 15, 2017, $853,829 is non-interest bearing.





	On May 1, 2017, a related party and significant shareholder advanced the Company $40,000 to fund business operations.





	On May 15, 2017, a related party and significant shareholder advanced the Company $50,000 to fund business operations. This advance is evidenced by a three month, interest bearing (8% per-annum), secured promissory note. The repayment of this promissory note is secured by the following Internet domain names and related websites: www.weeddepot.com and www.420careers.com. The existing lienholders, Kae Yong Park and Howard R. Baer, have subordinated their liens in these assets.







	Equity Transactions







	On April 10, 2017, we sold 1,000,000 shares of common stock in a private transaction at a per share price of $.025, for gross proceeds of $25,000, to an accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 502 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	Forward-looking Statements






	Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words may, would, could, should, expects, projects, anticipates, believes, estimates, plans, intends, targets or similar expressions.





	Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters.





	Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.






	Overview






	On June 23, 2014, the Company acquired approximately 7,500 cannabis related Internet domain names from Kae Yong Park (who then became our majority shareholder in connection with such acquisition). The list of domain names we acquired is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to the Form 8-K Current Report filed with the Commission on June 25, 2014. Currently, we own approximately 2,700 cannabis related internet domain names. Based upon our limited capital resources, we determined to allow certain domain names to expire that we concluded were of little utility to us given our business strategy.





	In consideration of the acquisition of these assets from Kae Yong Park, we issued her 78.5 million shares of our common stock. In addition, we issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000, $100,000 of which has been paid and the payment of $400,000 of which is contingent upon our achieving $150,000 in monthly revenues (see Note 14 - Related Party Transactions and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies). The remaining balance of $400,000 is payable in thirty-six equal monthly installments, commencing on the fifteenth day following the first month the Company realizes at least $150,000 in gross revenue.





	The Company has already launched several websites and portals and, subject to availability of sufficient funding (which the Company does not currently have), intends to build additional websites/portals around its owned internet domain names. These websites/portals will serve as directories for businesses engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and hemp related products.





	On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Tumbleweed Holdings, Inc. (TW), pursuant to which a newly formed joint venture company is developing an online dating service around the URL, www.jointlovers.com. The Company and TW own 60% and 40%, respectively, of equity of the joint venture company. On August 15, 2016, the Company instituted a legal action in Arizona against TW. The complaint alleges that (i) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund the remaining $15,000 due to the joint venture company by April 29, 2016, (ii) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund the last $50,000 convertible note due to the Company by April 29, 2016, and (iii) TW breached the joint venture agreement by failing to fund their respective 40% of development expense in excess of the initial $100,000. The Company seeks damages in the amount of $128,000 plus interest. On September 22, 2016, Tumbleweed Holdings Inc., instituted a counterclaim in Arizona in response to the above legal action. The complaint alleged that (i) The Company breached the joint venture agreement by failing to leverage relationships and failing to provide budgeting and accounting records, (ii) the Company breached implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by enticing TW into making significant contributions and then failing to perform under the agreement, (iii) the Company was unjustly enriched by having use of funds contributed by TW, (iv) the Company converted funds contributed by TW into its own assets, and (v) the Company has not provided accounting for all funds received by TW. TW seeks damages in the amount to be determined at trial. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against them.






	15
















	In May, 2017, we determined not to proceed with our previously announced planned acquisition of Stargreen Enterprises, LLC, a Los Angeles, California, company (Stargreen).





	Stargreen informed us that it has not raised the minimum $2.5 million called for by the LOI. In addition, Stargreen suggested substantial changes to the proposed transaction terms, which our management believed were not in the best interests of our shareholders. Based on the foregoing, we determined to terminate the planned acquisition transaction with Stargreen.





	In May, 2017, we signed a non-binding memorandum of terms to acquire Crush Mobile Apps, LLC (www.CrushMobileApps.com), in an all-stock transaction. Crush Mobile, with approximately one million members, has developed a group of dating sites with a presence in the Latino, Israeli and African American communities. Crush will also be incorporating Northsights Joint Lovers dating app, which concentrates on the Cannabis space, into its dating applications suite.





	Upon the closing, the Crush Mobile management team will take over our day to day operations, with the Crush Mobile current CEO, Sonya Kreizman, taking over as our interim CEO.





	Consummation of the acquisition transaction is subject to a variety of conditions, including our raising $500,000 prior to closing, due diligence investigation by both parties, obtaining all necessary corporate approvals, and the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated.





	Subject to the foregoing conditions, the closing is expected to occur around June 15, 2017.







	Recent Funding History







	Between February 29 and April 8, 2016, the Company received aggregate proceeds of $100,000 from the issuance of these convertible notes. The final $50,000 tranche was due April 29, 2016, but has not yet been paid. These notes are convertible into shares of the Companys stock at a price of $0.20 per share or a total of 250,000 shares each. Interest on these notes is to be payable quarterly in an amount equal to fifty percent of the original face value, based on a percentage of the joint venture companys net revenues. This interest will be payable only in the event that the joint venture company generates net revenues. Concurrent with this agreement, the Company issued the first of these convertible notes.





	Between February 29 and May 6, 2016, the joint venture company received aggregate proceeds of $85,000 from Tumbleweed Holdings, the joint venture partner. The final $15,000 tranche of the joint venture investment was due April 29, 2016 and remains unpaid. The Company is in litigation with Tumbleweed and is seeking to compel Tumbleweed to comply with its funding obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement.





	Between January 3, and April 17, 2017




	Kae Yong Park,


	a significant shareholder, and her spouse, Howard R, Baer (collectively, Park), made $46,650 of cash advances to us to fund our basic operations, $7,550 of which has been repaid and $35,938 of which has been recaptured for Parks use of Company personnel, leaving a balance due of $1,417,829, as of May 15, 2017. The Company has used these limited funds to fund its basic operations on a severely scaled back basis.





	Neither Ms. Park nor Mr. Baer are not under any obligation to provide any further funding to the Company. Ms. Park and her spouse are no longer able to provide ongoing advances to fund the companys operations. The funding received during 2016 and 2017 is insufficient to fund the Companys basic business operations. The Company has an immediate and urgent need for additional capital. Since early 2015, the Company has experienced great difficulty in raising capital from third parties. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.





	Between January 13, and May 1, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $109,299 from a related party and significant shareholder for which notes were issued bearing 8% interest annually. The notes, as extended, mature on August 1, 2017 and are unsecured. The Company had total notes payable to the related party of $171,849 at May 15, 2017.

	Results of Operations








	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016







	The Company incurred net losses of approximately $202,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $945,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The approximate $743,000 decrease n net loss is due primarily to the following: (all numbers approximate) a decrease in general and administrative expense of $97,000, due to mainly to decreases in consulting and contract labor expenses, a $178,000 decrease in executive compensation, due to a decrease in salaries and stock based compensation, a $6,00 decrease in professional fees, and a $476,000 decrease in non-cash losses on investments, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $15,000. If we are able to raise substantial additional capital, we expect to ramp up our operations which will cause our operating expenses to increase substantially.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources










	As of March 31, and May 15, 2017, we had virtually no cash on hand. Between January 13, and May 1, 2017, the Company received gross proceeds from debt agreements of $109,299. Additionally, in order to fund our basic operations, between January 3 and April 17, 2017, Kae Yong Park, a significant shareholder, and her spouse, Howard Baer (together, Park), have collectively made cash advances of $46,650 to fund our basic operations, $7,550 of which has been repaid. In addition, $35,938 of the amount owed Park has been recaptured for Parks use of Company personnel, leaving a balance due of $1,417,829, as of May 15, 2017.





	We continue to have an immediate and urgent need for additional capital. The lack of operating capital continues to materially and adversely affect our business operations. Due to the lack of operating capital, we are unable to implement our business plan. If the Company does not receive a significant infusion of capital in the near term, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern, in which case, investors would suffer a total loss of their investment in the Company.





	We have not yet realized significant operating revenues. We are however incurring significant costs and expenses in connection with the development of our business, implementation of our business plan and ongoing compliance costs associated with being a public company. Consequently, we are currently experiencing ongoing negative cash flows from operations.





	Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 (all numbers approximate) was $76,000, a decrease of approximately $57,000 from the $133,000 used during the comparable prior period. The $57,000 decrease in cash used by operations was due primarily to a $743,000 decrease in net loss, partially offset by a $33,000 decrease in warrants issued for executive compensation (non-cash), a $476,000 decrease in loss on securities (non-cash), a $179,000 decrease in the change (increase) in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $59,000 decrease in related party payables.





	Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $62,000 as compared to approximately $112,000 in the prior comparable period. The (all numbers are approximate) $50,000 decrease is due primarily to a decrease of $70,000 in proceeds from the issuance of debt (including convertible notes), partially offset by a $20,000 decrease in repayments on notes. The Company is experiencing ever increasing difficulty raising capital from third parties. Cash provided by financing activities is insufficient to fund the Companys basic operating activities.





	If we are able to obtain additional funding and ramp up our operations, our operations will use increasing amounts of cash in coming quarters, unless and until we are able to generate revenue from our operating activities.





	Based on our current business plan, we anticipate that our operating and website development activities will use approximately $100,000 in cash per month over the next twelve months, or $1.2 million. Currently we have virtually no cash on hand, and consequently, we are unable to implement our current business plan. We believe that our operations will not begin to generate positive cash flows until at least the fourth quarter of 2017 (assuming we secure sufficient funding in the near term to implement our business plan, which we currently do not have). Accordingly, we have an immediate and extremely urgent need for capital to fund our operating activities.






	17
















	In order to remedy this liquidity deficiency, we are actively seeking to raise additional funds through the sale of equity and debt securities, and ultimately we will need to generate substantial positive operating cash flows. Our internal sources of funds will consist of cash flows from operations, but not until we begin to realize substantial revenues from the sale of services. As previously stated, we currently have no revenue, and our operations are generating negative cash flows, and thus adversely affecting our liquidity. Although we are attempting to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing, we are having great difficulty in securing any significant funding from unrelated third parties. If we are able to secure sufficient funding in the near term to implement our business plan, we expect that our operations could begin to generate significant revenues during the fourth quarter 2017, which should ameliorate our liquidity deficiency. If we are unable to raise additional funds in the near term, we will not be able to implement our business plan, and it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern.





	Since early 2015, we have encountered great difficulty raising capital from unrelated third parties. There is a significant risk that we will be unable to raise additional capital form unrelated third parties. Although Kae Yong Park and Howard Baer have provided us with significant funds, they are under no obligation to do so and at this time are unable to provide additional funding. In the event we do not generate sufficient funds from revenues or financing through the issuance of common stock or from debt financing, we will be unable to implement our business plan and pay our obligations as they become due, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If the Company does not receive a significant infusion of capital in the near term, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern, in which case, investors would suffer a total loss of their investment in the Company. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to recover the value of its assets or satisfy its liabilities. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements - Liquidity/Going Concern.





	Subject to the availability of funds, which we currently do not have, we expect to incur approximately $175,000 in website development expenditures over the next 12 months (included in the $1.2 million estimate of cash required over the next twelve months). The purpose of these expenditures will be for the development of various Websites/portals we intend to create, modifications and improvements on existing sites and acquisition of additional domain names.





	We expect to fund these website development expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and proceeds from equity financing. If we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations, and/or raise additional funds (either through debt or equity), we will be unable to fund our website development expenditures, in which case, there could be an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.





	We intend to raise additional funds in the near term from the further sales of shares of common stock. Additional sales of common stock will reduce the percentage interest of existing shareholders in our company. Although it is possible, we do not believe it is likely that we will raise additional funds through the sale of debt securities in the near term.





	As described above, In June, 2014, we issued Kae Yong Park a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000, as partial consideration for the acquisition of approximately 7,500 cannabis related internet domain names. We have since paid $100,000 in principal to Ms. Park. The remaining balance of $400,000 is payable in thirty-six equal monthly installments, commencing on the fifteenth day following the first month we realize at least $150,000 in gross revenue. This remaining $400,000 balance is currently classified as a noncurrent liability. We believe that we will be able to make the approximate $11,000 monthly payment when (and if) we achieve the monthly $150,000 revenue threshold which triggers our repayment obligation.





	In addition, as described above, we are currently indebted to Kae Park, a significant shareholder, and Howard Baer, her spouse, in the aggregate amount of $1,417,829, which is secured by the Companys assets. As of April 13, 2016 (with an effective date of January 1, 2016), $564,000 of the principal due under the note evidencing this indebtedness is interest bearing at the rate of 10% annually with any remainder being non-interest bearing. All amounts due under this note are payable on demand. If demand for payment is made, and we are unable to pay the amount due, we would be in default and Ms. Park and Mr. Baer would have the right to sell our assets to satisfy the amounts due them under the promissory note. In such event, shareholders of the company would lose their entire investment in the Company.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls over Procedures






	Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and Financial Controller, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and financial controller, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and financial controller concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls were not effective.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
