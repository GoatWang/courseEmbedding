Home/ Our History







   









 Our History Our Firm was formed in 2009 for the purpose of serving as the exclusive investment advisor for RPCA Financial Ventures L.P. and RPCA Financial Ventures QP L.P - mirror image or parallel funds - (together "Fund 1"). Fund 1 is structured as a Hedge Fund and is NOT accepting any new investment capital at this time.  As of June 30, 2017 we have approximately $72MM of assets under management in Fund 1. 
In 2011, we launched RPCA Opportunistic Financial Ventures L.P. ("Fund 2"). Fund 2 is structured as a Hedge Fund and is NOT accepting any new investment capital at this time.  As of June 30, 2017, Fund 2 has approximately $51MM of assets under management. 
On April 3, 2017, we opened Rosenthal Income Strategies Fund L.P. (Fund "3").  Fund 3 is structured as a Hedge Fund and is currently accepting investments only from accredited investors who have received and reviewed our Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated February 28, 2017.  As of June 30, 2017, Fund 3 has approximately $6.5MM of assets under management.  
Our Firm seeks to enter into close professional relationships with investors in its limited partnerships as well as the companies in which the partnerships invest.  Please refer to About Our Firm  and Staff Bios for additional information about our Firm and our principals. The Funds for which we provide investment advisory services are audited annually by an outside audit firm and all Funds have received unqualified audit opinions.  Our Firm has engaged an independent 3rd party administrator for the Funds since inception.  That firm provides accounting services and maintains operating control over any disbursements made from the accounts of the Funds.    
Fund 1 is "fully invested" in the common stock of 18 community banks located in 15 states. Fund 2 is currently invested in 24 community bank stocks located in 15 different states.  Fund 3 is just beginning to deploy capital into investments. 
Audited financial statements for Fund 1 and Fund 2, which show the growth in partnership equity capital since the inception of each Fund, are available for inspection by accredited investors who have been approved by our Firm.  However, past performance does not guarantee future results and this investment involves significant risk. An investment in any of our Funds is not insured or guaranteed by any entity.  Nothing written in this website shall be construed as an offer to buy or sell securities.  Any such offer is made to accredited investors only by and through the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, Partnership Agreement and Subscription Booklet.
