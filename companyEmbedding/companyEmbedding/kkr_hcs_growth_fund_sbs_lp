US$6 billion the largest-ever pan-Asian private equity fund

	July 9, 2013 - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with its affiliates, âKKRâ) today announced the closing of its Asian II Fund at US$6 billion, making it the largest-ever pan-Asian private equity fund.

	The Asian II Fund marks the firmâs third successful fund raising in the region, following its US$4 billion regional fund in 2007 and its US$1 billion China Growth Fund in 2010.

	Having first established its presence in Asia Pacific in 2005, KKR has invested over US$5.5 billion in private equity investments in 30 companies across the region. In Asia, KKR has more than 100 executives and senior advisors in seven offices, located in Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.

	Joseph Bae, Member & Managing Partner of KKR Asia said, âThe successful close of our second Asian fund is a testament to our strong track record in the region.Â  We look forward to continuing to generate positive results for all our stakeholders. Having invested more than US$5.5 billion in Asia since 2005, we have demonstrated to investors our commitment to the region, as well as the effectiveness of our successful global-local and partnership approach.â

	KKRâs partnership approach enables Asian companies to tap into KKRâs global best practices to expand their businesses and improve operations to grow in their own markets and expand internationally.

	For its Asian II Fund, KKR sees opportunities in Asia arising from an increase in domestic consumption, and KKR focuses on local industries that can take advantage of this trend such as consumer, retail, healthcare, education and certain industrials. KKR also sees opportunities in: the rapid development of the financial services industry; the increasing demand for better and improved infrastructure; availability from non-core carve-outs and corporate divestitures as well as divestments from state-owned enterprises; the increasing global demand for specialized technology & precision manufacturing, which is present in selected Asian markets; and, increasing growth and generational-change opportunities with entrepreneurs.

	KKRâs private equity portfolio is diversified by country, industry and sector, and it includes both traditional control transactions as well as growth equity stakes in companies. KKR focuses on long-term business fundamentals, looking for companies that are market leaders in their sectors and that would benefit from partnering with KKR for greater growth.

	KKRâs Asian portfolio companies employ nearly 100,000 people, and, when combined with its global portfolio companies, KKRâs overall portfolio companies employ in Asia more than 150,000 people. In Asia, every company in which KKR has invested for more than two years has experienced employment growth. KKR is a long term investor, holding its private equity investments an average of five to seven years.

                            		ByÂ Herald Chen Jun 10, 2016		  	
                            	
Last week, Ping Identity â the leader in Identity Defined Security â announced an agreement to successfully sell the business. KKRâs TMT (Technology, Media, Telecommunications) team led Pingâs last growth equity investment round as part of the companyâs product platform expansion and focus on the global corporate enterprise market.  Since our investment, Pingâs annual recurring revenue grew by more than 40 percent in 2015, and today over 1,500 enterprises, including over half of the Fortune 100, have adopted the Ping Identity platform. We were pleased to have a strong partnership with the Ping management team, in particular Andre Durand, CEO and Founder, and Pingâs strong existing investors, including General Catalyst, W Capital, DFJ, Triangle Peak and Ten Eleven Ventures.
Consistent with our growth equity investing strategy, KKR was able to source an attractive risk-return investment and prove our ability to add value post-investment through the investment in Ping.  We were able to assist Ping management with not only our capital, but importantly with strategic and tactical assistance to accelerate Pingâs growth and prospects to become a long-standing enterprise in the security infrastructure marketplace.  
KKRâs investment in Ping centered on two primary premises. First, we believed behind Andre Durand, the company was well positioned to foster and benefit from the burgeoning Identity Defined Security market âan increasingly important market. Second, KKR had the tools to help scale Ping Identity into a large, profitable enterprise. KKR assets include a strong network for recruiting senior talent, 21 KKR offices around the world, a deep bench of senior advisors â former and current CEOs â as well as over 100 portfolio companies representing over $5 billion in annual IT spend. 
KKR is invested in over a dozen other growth stage companies, where we are working hard to create new longstanding enterprises like Pingâs.  For KKR, growth equity means focusing on market-leading, high-growth companies for which we can be a unique partner in helping a company reach scale and the next level of growth -- beyond just providing capital. 

The specific portfolio company identified is not representative of all of the securities purchased, sold or recommended for advisory clients, and it should not be assumed that the investment in the company identified was or will be profitable. Senior Advisors, Industry Advisors, and KKR Advisors are engaged as consultants and are not employees of KKR.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
