SAN DIEGO, Nov. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra Energy (NYSE:   SRE) today announced that Pablo Ferrero has been appointed to the company's board of directors.
Ferrero's experience includes 22 years in the energy industry, including director and senior management positions with major South American energy companies.

In the past, he has served as director and chairman of the board of several other energy companies and industry-related boards.
From 2006 to 2011, Ferrero was executive vice president for the Southern Cone region of South America for Ashmore Energy International (AEI Energy), where he was charged with asset development and management for several company subsidiaries and projects, including major natural gas pipelines, power plants and utilities in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Bolivia. 
From 2004 to 2006, Ferrero served as CEO for Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A., where he oversaw debt restructuring, pipeline expansions and the development of the company's non-regulated businesses.  
Ferrero also held several positions with Petrobras Energia S.A., including executive vice president of planning and business development, from 2001 to 2004.  He was responsible for the development of all the company's businesses, including oil and gas, petrochemicals, refining, power, mining, agribusiness, and mergers and acquisitions.  
A resident of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Ferrero holds a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Universidad Catolica Argentina and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Washington.
