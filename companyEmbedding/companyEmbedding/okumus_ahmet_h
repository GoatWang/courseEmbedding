United States of America (For the Federal Trade Commission), Plaintiff, v. Ahmet H. Okumus, Defendant. 

      FTC Matter/File Number:
    

        161 0189      



      Civil Action Number:
    

        Case 1:17-cv-00104      



      Enforcement Type:
    

        Civil Penalty (7a)      



      Federal Court:
    

        District of Columbia      


    Case Summary  

Hedge fund founder Ahmet H. Okumus has agreed to pay $180,000 in civil penalties to resolve charges that he violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by failing to report his purchases of voting securities in the internet services company Web.com Group Inc. The FTC alleged that Okumus violated the HSR Act by exceeding the filing threshold and failing to file as required when he bought shares of Web.com through his hedge fund, Okumus Opportunistic Value Fund, Ltd. According to the complaint, he was in violation of the HSR Act from June 27, 2016, when he purchased the shares, to July 14, 2016, when he sold enough shares so that he did not exceed the threshold. Although the Commission found his HSR violation to be inadvertent, it determined to seek penalties because, as noted in the complaint, this was Okumus’s second HSR violation in two years regarding Web.com.

The position is unchanged compared with Okumus’ last 13F filing and amasses 10.5% of the company’s outstanding stock. However, the filing also revealed that Okumus had entered into an agreement with Ascent Capital Group, under the terms of which, the company would appoint Rana Kashyap to its Board as a Class III director.  “Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Okumus agreed, that during the term of the Settlement Agreement, among other things, to cause all shares beneficially owned by it to be voted (i) in favor of each director nominated by the Board; (ii) against any stockholder nominations for directors which are not approved or recommended by the Board; and (iii) in accordance with the Board’s recommendation with respect to all other matters, provided that (a) Okumus may vote in its sole discretion with respect to any Board-approved publicly announced proposals relating to a merger, acquisition, disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or other business combination (a “Business Combination”) involving the Issuer and (b) nothing in the Settlement Agreement shall prevent Okumus from announcing its views and its vote on any such Business Combination, so long as such announcement is limited to the merits and is not disparaging,” Okumus added in the filing.  Overall, a total of 10 funds among those tracked by Insider Monkey own shares of Ascent Captail Group as of the end of 2015, while the largest position is held by Francis Chou’s Chou Associates Management with a $176.6 million stake. Other investors with long positions include Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors, Scott Wallace’s Wallace Capital Management and Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. On the other hand, Paul Hondros’s AlphaOne Capital Partners  unloaded its entire stake in Ascent, worth around $1.6 million. You can access the original SEC filing by clicking here.

and entry of the Final Judgment in this
District.
THE DEFENDANT
4. Defendant Okumus is a natural
person with his principal office and
place of business at 767 Third Avenue,
35th Floor, New York, NY 10017.
Okumus is engaged in commerce, or in
activities affecting commerce, within
the meaning of Section 1 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 12, and Section 7A(a)(1)
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(a)(1).
At all times relevant to this complaint,
Okumus had sales or assets in excess of
$156.3 million.
OTHER ENTITIES
5. Web.com is a corporation organized
under the laws of Delaware with its
principal place of business at 12808
Gran Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville,
FL 32258. Web.com is engaged in
commerce, or in activities affecting
commerce, within the meaning of
Section 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.
12, and Section 7A(a)(1) of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(a)(1). At all times
relevant to this complaint, Web.com had
sales or assets in excess of $15.6
million.
THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT AND
RULES
6. The HSR Act requires certain
acquiring persons and certain persons
whose voting securities or assets are
acquired to file notifications with the
federal antitrust agencies and to observe
a waiting period before consummating
certain acquisitions of voting securities
or assets. 15 U.S.C. 18a(a) and (b). These
notification and waiting period
requirements apply to acquisitions that
meet the HSR Act’s thresholds. As of
February 1, 2001, the size of transaction
threshold was $50 million. In addition,
there is a separate filing requirement for
transactions in which the acquirer will
hold voting securities in excess of $100
million, and for transactions in which
the acquirer will hold voting securities
in excess of $500 million. With respect
to the size of person thresholds, the HSR
Act requires one person involved in the
transaction to have sales or assets in
excess of $10 million, and the other
person to have sales or assets in excess
of $100 million. Since 2004, the size of
transaction and size of person
thresholds have been adjusted annually.
7. The HSR Act’s notification and
waiting period requirements are
intended to give the federal antitrust
agencies prior notice of, and
information about, proposed
transactions. The waiting period is also

asabaliauskas on DSK3SPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 19 / Tuesday, January 31, 2017 / Notices
intended to provide the federal antitrust
agencies with an opportunity to
investigate a proposed transaction and
to determine whether to seek an
injunction to prevent the consummation
of a transaction that may violate the
antitrust laws.
8. Section (c)(9) of the HSR Act, 15
U.S.C. 18a(c)(9), exempts from the
requirements of the HSR Act
acquisitions of voting securities made
solely for the purpose of investment if,
as a result of the acquisition, the
securities acquired or held do not
exceed ten percent of the outstanding
voting securities of the issuer.
9. Pursuant to Section (d)(2) of the
HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(d)(2), rules were
promulgated to carry out the purposes
of the HSR Act. 16 CFR 801–03 (‘‘HSR
Rules’’). The HSR Rules, among other
things, define terms contained in the
HSR Act.
10. Pursuant to section 801.13(a)(1) of
the HSR Rules, 16 CFR 801.13(a)(1), ‘‘all
voting securities of [an] issuer which
will be held by the acquiring person
after the consummation of an
acquisition’’—including any held before
the acquisition—are deemed held ‘‘as a
result of’’ the acquisition at issue.
11. Pursuant to sections 801.13(a)(2)
and 801.10(c)(1) of the HSR Rules, 16
CFR 801.13(a)(2) and 801.10(c)(1), the
value of voting securities already held is
the market price, defined to be the
lowest closing price within 45 days
prior to the subsequent acquisition.
12. Section 802.21 of the HSR Rules,
16 CFR 802.21, provides that once a
person has filed under the HSR Act and
the waiting period has expired, the
person can acquire additional voting
securities of the issuer without making
a new filing for five years from the
expiration of the waiting period, so long
as the holdings do not exceed a higher
threshold than was indicated in the
filing.
13. Section 7A(g)(1) of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(g)(1), provides that
any person, or any officer, director, or
partner thereof, who fails to comply
with any provision of the HSR Act is
liable to the United States for a civil
penalty for each day during which such
person is in violation. Pursuant to the
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of
2015, Pub. L. 114–74, 701 (further
amending the Federal Civil Penalties
Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990), and
Federal Trade Commission Rule 1.98, 16
CFR 1.98, 81 FR 42,476 (June 30, 2016),
the maximum amount of civil penalty is
$40,000 per day.

DEFENDANT’S PRIOR VIOLATION OF
THE HSR ACT
14. On September 11, 2014, Okumus
acquired voting securities of Web.com.
As a result of this acquisition, Okumus
held approximately 13.5% of the voting
securities of Web.com. Okumus did not
file under the HSR Act because he was
relying on the exemption for
acquisitions solely for the purpose of
investment. However, that exemption is
limited to acquisitions which result in
holding 10% or less of the voting
securities of the issuer. Accordingly,
Okumus was required to file under the
HSR Act prior to acquiring Web.com
voting securities on September 11, 2014.
Okumus continued to acquire voting
securities of Web.com through
November 6, 2014.
15. On November 21, 2014, Okumus
made a corrective filing under the HSR
Act for the acquisitions of Web.com
voting securities. In a letter
accompanying the corrective filing,
Okumus acknowledged that the
transaction was reportable under the
HSR Act, but asserted that the failure to
file and observe the waiting period was
inadvertent.
16. On December 31, 2014, the
Premerger Notification Office of the
Federal Trade Commission sent a letter
to Okumus indicating that it would not
recommend a civil penalty action
regarding the September 11, 2014,
Web.com acquisition. The letter
advised, however, that Okumus ‘‘still
must bear responsibility for compliance
with the Act’’ and was ‘‘accountable for
instituting an effective program to
ensure full compliance with the Act’s
requirements.’’
DEFENDANT’S VIOLATION OF THE
HSR ACT
17. In his corrective HSR Act filing for
the 2014 Web.com acquisitions,
Okumus filed at the $50 million
threshold. After the expiration of the
waiting period, Okumus was permitted
under the HSR Act to acquire additional
voting securities of Web.com without
making another HSR Act filing so long
as he did not exceed the $100 million
threshold, as adjusted. As of February
25, 2016, the adjusted $100 million
threshold was $156.3 million.
18. On June 2, 2016, Okumus began
acquiring additional voting securities of
Web.com. Okumus continued to acquire
additional voting securities of Web.com
through June 27, 2016.
19. On June 27, 2016, Okumus
acquired 236,589 voting securities of
Web.com. As a result of this acquisition,
Okumus held voting securities of
Web.com valued in excess of the $156.3
million threshold then in effect.

PO 00000

Frm 00037

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

20. Although required to do so,
Okumus did not file under the HSR Act
or observe the HSR Act’s waiting period
prior to completing the June 27, 2016,
transaction.
21. On July 14, 2016, Okumus sold
33,200 voting securities of Web.com. As
a result of this sale, Okumus no longer
held voting securities of Web.com
valued in excess of the $156.3 million
HSR Act threshold.
22. Okumus was in continuous
violation of the HSR Act from June 27,
2016, when he acquired the Web.com
voting securities valued in excess of the
HSR Act’s then applicable $156.3 filing
threshold, through July 14, 2016, when
he no longer held voting securities of
Web.com valued in excess of $156.3
million.
REQUESTED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests:
a. That the Court adjudge and decree
that Defendant’s acquisition of Web.com
voting securities on June 27, 2016, was
a violation of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C.
18a; and that Defendant was in violation
of the HSR Act each day from June 27,
2016, through July 14, 2016;
b. That the Court order Defendant to
pay to the United States an appropriate
civil penalty as provided by the HSR
Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(g)(1), and the Federal
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act
Improvements Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114–
74, § 701 (further amending the Federal
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act
of 1990), and Federal Trade Commission
Rule 1.98, 16 CFR 1.98, 81 FR 42,476
(June 30, 2016);
c. That the Court order such other and
further relief as the Court may deem just
and proper; and
d. That the Court award Plaintiff its
costs of this suit.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
United States of America, Plaintiff, v.
Ahmet H. Okumus, Defendant.
Case No.: 1:17–cv–00104
Judge: Rosemary M. Collyer
Filed: 01/17/2017

asabaliauskas on DSK3SPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

COMPETITIVE IMPACT STATEMENT
The United States, pursuant to the
Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act
(‘‘APPA’’), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)–(h), files this
Competitive Impact Statement to set
forth the information necessary to
enable the Court and the public to
evaluate the proposed Final Judgment
that would terminate this civil antitrust
proceeding.
I. NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THIS
PROCEEDING
On January 17, 2017, the United
States filed a Complaint against
Defendant Ahmet H. Okumus
(‘‘Okumus’’), related to Okumus’s
acquisition of voting securities of
Web.com Group, Inc. (‘‘Web.com’’) in
June 2016. The Complaint alleges that
Okumus violated Section 7A of the
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, commonly
known as the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the
‘‘HSR Act’’). The HSR Act provides that
‘‘no person shall acquire, directly or
indirectly, any voting securities of any
person’’ exceeding certain thresholds
until that person has filed preacquisition notification and report forms
with the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission (collectively,
the ‘‘federal antitrust agencies’’ or
‘‘agencies’’) and the post-filing waiting
period has expired. 15 U.S.C. 18a(a). A
key purpose of the notification and
waiting period is to protect consumers
and competition from potentially
anticompetitive transactions by
providing the agencies an opportunity
to conduct an antitrust review of
proposed transactions before they are
consummated.
The Complaint alleges that Okumus
acquired voting securities of Web.com
in excess of then-applicable statutory
thresholds without making the required
pre-acquisition HSR filings with the
agencies and without observing the
waiting period, and that Okumus and
Web.com met the applicable statutory
size of person thresholds.
At the same time the Complaint was
filed in the present action, the United
States also filed a Stipulation and
proposed Final Judgment that
eliminates the need for a trial in this
case. The proposed Final Judgment is
designed to deter Okumus’ HSR Act
violations. Under the proposed Final
Judgment, Okumus must pay a civil

VerDate Sep<11>2014

18:22 Jan 30, 2017

Jkt 241001

penalty to the United States in the
amount of $180,000.
The United States and the Defendant
have stipulated that the proposed Final
Judgment may be entered after
compliance with the APPA, unless the
United States first withdraws its
consent. Entry of the proposed Final
Judgment would terminate this case,
except that the Court would retain
jurisdiction to construe, modify, or
enforce the provisions of the proposed
Final Judgment and punish violations
thereof.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS
GIVING RISE TO THE ALLEGED
VIOLATIONS OF THE ANTITRUST
LAWS
Okumus is an investor with his
principal office and place of business in
New York City. At all times relevant to
the Complaint, Okumus had sales or
assets in excess of $156.3 million. At all
times relevant to the Complaint,
Web.com, a Delaware corporation
headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida,
had sales or assets in excess of $15.6
million.
On November 21, 2014, Okumus filed
under the HSR Act to acquire voting
securities of Web.com. Okumus filed at
the $50 million threshold, as adjusted.
After the waiting period expired,
Okumus was permitted under the HSR
Act to acquire additional voting
securities of Web.com for five years
without making a new HSR filing so
long as his holdings did not exceed the
$100 million threshold, as adjusted. On
June 27, 2016, Okumus acquired
additional voting securities of Web.com.
As a result of this acquisition, Okumus
held voting securities of Web.com
valued at approximately $156.6 million,
which was in excess of $156.3 million,
the as adjusted $100 million threshold
in effect at the time. Although he was
required to do so under the HSR Act,
Okumus failed to make an HSR filing
and observe the statutory waiting period
before consummating the June 27, 2016
acquisition.
On July 14, 2016, Okumus sold voting
securities of Web.com. As a result of
this sale, he no longer held voting
securities valued in excess of $156.3
million, and was no longer in violation
of the HSR Act.
The Complaint further alleges that
Okumus’s June 2016 HSR Act violation
was not the first time Okumus had
failed to observe the HSR Act’s
notification and waiting period
requirements. On September 11, 2014,
Okumus acquired voting securities of
Web.com. As a result of this acquisition,
Okumus held approximately 13.5
percent of the voting securities of

PO 00000

Frm 00038

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

Web.com. Okumus did not file under
the HSR Act prior to making this
acquisition, relying on the exemption
for acquisitions made solely for the
purpose of investment. See 15 U.S.C.
18a(c)(9). However, the exemption is
limited to acquisitions that result in
holdings that do not exceed ten percent
of the voting securities of the issuer;
acquisitions that result in holding in
excess of ten percent require an HSR
filing regardless of the purpose of the
acquisition. On November 21, 2014,
Okumus made a corrective HSR filing
for the September 11, 2014 acquisition,
and explained in a letter accompanying
the corrective filing that his failure to
file was inadvertent. On December 31,
2014, the Premerger Notification Office
of the Federal Trade Commission
notified Okumus by letter that it would
not recommend a civil penalty for the
violation, but advised Okumus that he
was ‘‘accountable for instituting an
effective program to ensure full
compliance with the Act’s
requirements.’’
III. EXPLANATION OF THE
PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
The proposed Final Judgment
imposes a $180,000 civil penalty
designed to deter the Defendant and
others from violating the HSR Act. The
United States adjusted the penalty
downward from the maximum
permitted under the HSR Act because
the violation was inadvertent, the
Defendant promptly corrected the
violation after discovery by selling
voting securities, and the Defendant is
willing to resolve the matter by consent
decree and avoid prolonged
investigation and litigation. The relief
will have a beneficial effect on
competition because the agencies will
be properly notified of future
acquisitions, in accordance with the
law. At the same time, the penalty will
not have any adverse effect on
competition.
IV. REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO
POTENTIAL PRIVATE LITIGANTS
There is no private antitrust action for
HSR Act violations; therefore, entry of
the proposed Final Judgment will
neither impair nor assist the bringing of
any private antitrust action.
V. PROCEDURES AVAILABLE FOR
MODIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED
FINAL JUDGMENT
The United States and the Defendant
have stipulated that the proposed Final
Judgment may be entered by this Court
after compliance with the provisions of
the APPA, provided that the United
States has not withdrawn its consent.

E:\FR\FM\31JAN1.SGM

31JAN1

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 19 / Tuesday, January 31, 2017 / Notices
The APPA conditions entry of the
decree upon this Court’s determination
that the proposed Final Judgment is in
the public interest.
The APPA provides a period of at
least sixty (60) days preceding the
effective date of the proposed Final
Judgment within which any person may
submit to the United States written
comments regarding the proposed Final
Judgment. Any person who wishes to
comment should do so within sixty (60)
days of the date of publication of this
Competitive Impact Statement in the
Federal Register, or the last date of
publication in a newspaper of the
summary of this Competitive Impact
Statement, whichever is later. All
comments received during this period
will be considered by the United States,
which remains free to withdraw its
consent to the proposed Final Judgment
at any time prior to entry. The
comments and the response of the
United States will be filed with this
Court. In addition, comments will be
posted on the U.S. Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division’s internet
Web site and, under certain
circumstances, published in the Federal
Register. Written comments should be
submitted to:

Special Attorney, United States
c/o Federal Trade Commission

Email: dducore@ftc.gov.
The proposed Final Judgment
provides that this Court retains
jurisdiction over this action, and the
parties may apply to this Court for any
order necessary or appropriate for the
modification, interpretation, or
enforcement of the Final Judgment.

VI. ALTERNATIVES TO THE
PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
As an alternative to the proposed
Final Judgment, the United States
considered pursuing a full trial on the
merits against the Defendant. The
United States is satisfied, however, that
the proposed relief is an appropriate
remedy in this matter. Given the facts of
this case, including the Defendant’s selfreporting of the violation and
willingness to promptly settle this
matter, the United States is satisfied that
the proposed civil penalty is sufficient
to address the violation alleged in the
Complaint and to deter violations by
similarly situated entities in the future,
without the time, expense, and
uncertainty of a full trial on the merits.

VII. STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER
THE APPA FOR THE PROPOSED
FINAL JUDGMENT
The APPA requires proposed consent
judgments in antitrust cases brought by
the United States be subject to a sixty
(60) day comment period, after which
the court shall determine whether entry
of the proposed Final Judgment is ‘‘in
the public interest.’’ 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1).
In making that determination, the court,
in accordance with the statute as
amended in 2004, is required to
consider:
(A) the competitive impact of such
judgment, including termination of
alleged violations, provisions for
enforcement and modification, duration
of relief sought, anticipated effects of
alternative remedies actually
considered, whether its terms are
ambiguous, and any other competitive
considerations bearing upon the
adequacy of such judgment that the
court deems necessary to a
determination of whether the consent
judgment is in the public interest; and
(B) the impact of entry of such
judgment upon competition in the
relevant market or markets, upon the
public generally and individuals
alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint
including consideration of the public
benefit, if any, to be derived from a
determination of the issues at trial.
Id. § 16(e)(1)(A) & (B). In considering
these statutory factors, the court’s
inquiry is necessarily a limited one, as
the government is entitled to ‘‘broad
discretion to settle with the defendant
within the reaches of the public
interest.’’ United States v. Microsoft
Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1461 (D.C. Cir.
1995); see generally United States v.
SBC Commc’ns, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1

standard under the Tunney Act); United
States v. U.S. Airways Group, Inc., 38 F.
Supp. 3d 69, 75 (D.D.C. 2014) (noting
that the court’s ‘‘inquiry is limited’’
because the government has ‘‘broad
discretion’’ to determine the adequacy
of the relief secured through a
settlement); United States v. InBev N.V./

Cas. (CCH) ¶ 76,736, 2009 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 84787, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 11,
2009) (noting that the court’s review of
a consent judgment is limited and only
inquires ‘‘into whether the government’s
determination that the proposed
remedies will cure the antitrust
violations alleged in the complaint was
reasonable, and whether the mechanism

to enforce the final judgment are clear
and manageable.’’).1
As the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit has
held, a court conducting an inquiry
under the APPA may consider, among
other things, the relationship between
the remedy secured and the specific
allegations set forth in the government’s
complaint, whether the decree is
sufficiently clear, whether enforcement
mechanisms are sufficient, and whether
the decree may positively harm third
parties. See Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1458–
62. With respect to the adequacy of the
relief secured by the decree, a court may
not ‘‘engage in an unrestricted
evaluation of what relief would best
serve the public.’’ United States v. BNS,
Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988)
(quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp.,
648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir. 1981)); see
also Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460–62;
United States v. Alcoa, Inc., 152 F.
Supp. 2d 37, 40 (D.D.C. 2001); InBev,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *3.
Courts have held that:
[t]he balancing of competing social and
political interests affected by a proposed
antitrust consent decree must be left, in
the first instance, to the discretion of the
Attorney General. The court’s role in
protecting the public interest is one of
insuring that the government has not
breached its duty to the public in
consenting to the decree. The court is
required to determine not whether a
particular decree is the one that will
best serve society, but whether the
settlement is ‘‘within the reaches of the
public interest.’’ More elaborate
requirements might undermine the
effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by
consent decree.
Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (emphasis
added) (citations omitted).2 In
determining whether a proposed
settlement is in the public interest, a
district court ‘‘must accord deference to
the government’s predictions about the

competitive considerations and to address
potentially ambiguous judgment terms. Compare 15
U.S.C. § 16(e) (2004), with 15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(1)
(2006); see also SBC Commc’ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at
11 (concluding that the 2004 amendments ‘‘effected
minimal changes’’ to Tunney Act review).

limited to approving or disapproving the consent
decree’’); United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp.
713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975) (noting that, in this way,
the court is constrained to ‘‘look at the overall
picture not hypercritically, nor with a microscope,
but with an artist’s reducing glass’’). See generally
Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 (discussing whether ‘‘the
remedies [obtained in the decree are] so
inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall
outside of the ‘reaches of the public interest’ ’’).

efficacy of its remedies, and may not
require that the remedies perfectly
match the alleged violations.’’ SBC
Commc’ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 17; see
also U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 75
(noting that a court should not reject the
proposed remedies because it believes
others are preferable); Microsoft, 56 F.3d
at 1461 (noting the need for courts to be
‘‘deferential to the government’s
predictions as to the effect of the
proposed remedies’’); United States v.
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., 272 F.
Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2003) (noting that
the court should grant due respect to the
government’s prediction as to the effect
of proposed remedies, its perception of
the market structure, and its views of
the nature of the case).
Courts have greater flexibility in
approving proposed consent decrees
than in crafting their own decrees
following a finding of liability in a
litigated matter. ‘‘[A] proposed decree
must be approved even if it falls short
of the remedy the court would impose
on its own, as long as it falls within the
range of acceptability or is ‘within the
reaches of public interest.’ ’’ United
States v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F.
Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982) (citations
omitted) (quoting United States v.
Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D.
Mass. 1975)), aff’d sub nom., Maryland
v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983);
see also U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at
76 (noting that room must be made for
the government to grant concessions in
the negotiation process for settlements
(citing Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461));
United States v. Alcan Aluminum Ltd.,
605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky. 1985)
(approving the consent decree even
though the court would have imposed a
greater remedy). To meet this standard,
the United States ‘‘need only provide a
factual basis for concluding that the
settlements are reasonably adequate
remedies for the alleged harms.’’ SBC
Commc’ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 17.
Moreover, the court’s role under the
APPA is limited to reviewing the
remedy in relationship to the violations
that the United States has alleged in its
Complaint, and does not authorize the
court to ‘‘construct [its] own
hypothetical case and then evaluate the
decree against that case.’’ Microsoft, 56
F.3d at 1459; see also U.S. Airways, 38
F. Supp. 3d at 75 (noting that the court
must simply determine whether there is
a factual foundation for the
government’s decisions such that its
conclusions regarding the proposed
settlements are reasonable); InBev, 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *20
(concluding that ‘‘the ‘public interest’ is
not to be measured by comparing the
violations alleged in the complaint

Jkt 241001

against those the court believes could
have, or even should have, been
alleged’’). Because the ‘‘court’s authority
to review the decree depends entirely
on the government’s exercising its
prosecutorial discretion by bringing a
case in the first place,’’ it follows that
‘‘the court is only authorized to review
the decree itself,’’ and not to ‘‘effectively
redraft the complaint’’ to inquire into
other matters that the United States did
not pursue. Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459–
60. As this Court confirmed in SBC
Communications, courts ‘‘cannot look
beyond the complaint in making the
public interest determination unless the
complaint is drafted so narrowly as to
make a mockery of judicial power.’’ 489
F. Supp. 2d at 15.
In its 2004 amendments, Congress
made clear its intent to preserve the
practical benefits of utilizing consent
decrees in antitrust enforcement, adding
the unambiguous instruction that
‘‘[n]othing in this section shall be
construed to require the court to
conduct an evidentiary hearing or to
require the court to permit anyone to
intervene.’’ 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(2); see also
U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 76
(indicating that a court is not required
to hold an evidentiary hearing or to
permit intervenors as part of its review
under the Tunney Act). This language
codified what Congress intended when
it enacted the Tunney Act in 1974, as
the author of this legislation, Senator
Tunney, explained: ‘‘The court is
nowhere compelled to go to trial or to
engage in extended proceedings which
might have the effect of vitiating the
benefits of prompt and less costly
settlement through the consent decree
process.’’ 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973)
(statement of Sen. Tunney). Rather, the
procedure for the public interest
determination is left to the discretion of
the court, with the recognition that the
court’s ‘‘scope of review remains
sharply proscribed by precedent and the
nature of Tunney Act proceedings.’’
SBC Commc’ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 11.3

Supp. 2d 10, 17 (D.D.C. 2000) (noting that the

reasonable under the circumstances.’’); S. Rep. No.

United States of America, c/o Department of Justice, Washington,

Floor, New York, NY 10017, Defendant.
Case No.: 1:17-cv-00104
Judge: Rosemary M. Collyer
Filed: 01/17/2017

COMPLAINT FOR CIVIL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PREMERGER 
REPORTING AND WAITING REQUIREMENTS OF THE HART-SCOTT RODINO ACT

    The United States of America, Plaintiff, by its attorneys, acting 
under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States and at 
the request of the Federal Trade Commission, brings this civil 
antitrust action to obtain monetary relief in the form of civil 
penalties against Defendant Ahmet H. Okumus (``Okumus''). Plaintiff 
alleges as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

    1. Okumus violated the notice and waiting period requirements of 
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. 18a 
(``HSR Act'' or ``Act''), with respect to the acquisition of voting 
securities of Web.com Group, Inc. (``Web.com'').

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

    2. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this 
action pursuant to Section 7A(g) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(g), 
and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1337(a), 1345, and 1355 and over the 
Defendant by virtue of Defendant's consent, in the Stipulation relating 
hereto, to the maintenance of this action and entry of the Final 
Judgment in this District.
    3. Venue is properly based in this District by virtue of 
Defendant's consent, in the Stipulation relating hereto, to the 
maintenance of this action and entry of the Final Judgment in this 
District.

THE DEFENDANT

    4. Defendant Okumus is a natural person with his principal office 
and place of business at 767 Third Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, NY 
10017. Okumus is engaged in commerce, or in activities affecting 
commerce, within the meaning of Section 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 
12, and Section 7A(a)(1) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(a)(1). At 
all times relevant to this complaint, Okumus had sales or assets in 
excess of $156.3 million.

OTHER ENTITIES

    5. Web.com is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware 
with its principal place of business at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West, 
Jacksonville, FL 32258. Web.com is engaged in commerce, or in 
activities affecting commerce, within the meaning of Section 1 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 12, and Section 7A(a)(1) of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. 18a(a)(1). At all times relevant to this complaint, Web.com had 
sales or assets in excess of $15.6 million.

THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT AND RULES

    6. The HSR Act requires certain acquiring persons and certain 
persons whose voting securities or assets are acquired to file 
notifications with the federal antitrust agencies and to observe a 
waiting period before consummating certain acquisitions of voting 
securities or assets. 15 U.S.C. 18a(a) and (b). These notification and 
waiting period requirements apply to acquisitions that meet the HSR 
Act's thresholds. As of February 1, 2001, the size of transaction 
threshold was $50 million. In addition, there is a separate filing 
requirement for transactions in which the acquirer will hold voting 
securities in excess of $100 million, and for transactions in which the 
acquirer will hold voting securities in excess of $500 million. With 
respect to the size of person thresholds, the HSR Act requires one 
person involved in the transaction to have sales or assets in excess of 
$10 million, and the other person to have sales or assets in excess of 
$100 million. Since 2004, the size of transaction and size of person 
thresholds have been adjusted annually.
    7. The HSR Act's notification and waiting period requirements are 
intended to give the federal antitrust agencies prior notice of, and 
information about, proposed transactions. The waiting period is also

[[Page 8859]]

intended to provide the federal antitrust agencies with an opportunity 
to investigate a proposed transaction and to determine whether to seek 
an injunction to prevent the consummation of a transaction that may 
violate the antitrust laws.
    8. Section (c)(9) of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(c)(9), exempts from 
the requirements of the HSR Act acquisitions of voting securities made 
solely for the purpose of investment if, as a result of the 
acquisition, the securities acquired or held do not exceed ten percent 
of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer.
    9. Pursuant to Section (d)(2) of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(d)(2), 
rules were promulgated to carry out the purposes of the HSR Act. 16 CFR 
801-03 (``HSR Rules''). The HSR Rules, among other things, define terms 
contained in the HSR Act.
    10. Pursuant to section 801.13(a)(1) of the HSR Rules, 16 CFR 
801.13(a)(1), ``all voting securities of [an] issuer which will be held 
by the acquiring person after the consummation of an acquisition''--
including any held before the acquisition--are deemed held ``as a 
result of'' the acquisition at issue.
    11. Pursuant to sections 801.13(a)(2) and 801.10(c)(1) of the HSR 
Rules, 16 CFR 801.13(a)(2) and 801.10(c)(1), the value of voting 
securities already held is the market price, defined to be the lowest 
closing price within 45 days prior to the subsequent acquisition.
    12. Section 802.21 of the HSR Rules, 16 CFR 802.21, provides that 
once a person has filed under the HSR Act and the waiting period has 
expired, the person can acquire additional voting securities of the 
issuer without making a new filing for five years from the expiration 
of the waiting period, so long as the holdings do not exceed a higher 
threshold than was indicated in the filing.
    13. Section 7A(g)(1) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(g)(1), 
provides that any person, or any officer, director, or partner thereof, 
who fails to comply with any provision of the HSR Act is liable to the 
United States for a civil penalty for each day during which such person 
is in violation. Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-74, 701 (further 
amending the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990), 
and Federal Trade Commission Rule 1.98, 16 CFR 1.98, 81 FR 42,476 (June 
30, 2016), the maximum amount of civil penalty is $40,000 per day.

DEFENDANT'S PRIOR VIOLATION OF THE HSR ACT

    14. On September 11, 2014, Okumus acquired voting securities of 
Web.com. As a result of this acquisition, Okumus held approximately 
13.5% of the voting securities of Web.com. Okumus did not file under 
the HSR Act because he was relying on the exemption for acquisitions 
solely for the purpose of investment. However, that exemption is 
limited to acquisitions which result in holding 10% or less of the 
voting securities of the issuer. Accordingly, Okumus was required to 
file under the HSR Act prior to acquiring Web.com voting securities on 
September 11, 2014. Okumus continued to acquire voting securities of 
Web.com through November 6, 2014.
    15. On November 21, 2014, Okumus made a corrective filing under the 
HSR Act for the acquisitions of Web.com voting securities. In a letter 
accompanying the corrective filing, Okumus acknowledged that the 
transaction was reportable under the HSR Act, but asserted that the 
failure to file and observe the waiting period was inadvertent.
    16. On December 31, 2014, the Premerger Notification Office of the 
Federal Trade Commission sent a letter to Okumus indicating that it 
would not recommend a civil penalty action regarding the September 11, 
2014, Web.com acquisition. The letter advised, however, that Okumus 
``still must bear responsibility for compliance with the Act'' and was 
``accountable for instituting an effective program to ensure full 
compliance with the Act's requirements.''

DEFENDANT'S VIOLATION OF THE HSR ACT

    17. In his corrective HSR Act filing for the 2014 Web.com 
acquisitions, Okumus filed at the $50 million threshold. After the 
expiration of the waiting period, Okumus was permitted under the HSR 
Act to acquire additional voting securities of Web.com without making 
another HSR Act filing so long as he did not exceed the $100 million 
threshold, as adjusted. As of February 25, 2016, the adjusted $100 
million threshold was $156.3 million.
    18. On June 2, 2016, Okumus began acquiring additional voting 
securities of Web.com. Okumus continued to acquire additional voting 
securities of Web.com through June 27, 2016.
    19. On June 27, 2016, Okumus acquired 236,589 voting securities of 
Web.com. As a result of this acquisition, Okumus held voting securities 
of Web.com valued in excess of the $156.3 million threshold then in 
effect.
    20. Although required to do so, Okumus did not file under the HSR 
Act or observe the HSR Act's waiting period prior to completing the 
June 27, 2016, transaction.
    21. On July 14, 2016, Okumus sold 33,200 voting securities of 
Web.com. As a result of this sale, Okumus no longer held voting 
securities of Web.com valued in excess of the $156.3 million HSR Act 
threshold.
    22. Okumus was in continuous violation of the HSR Act from June 27, 
2016, when he acquired the Web.com voting securities valued in excess 
of the HSR Act's then applicable $156.3 filing threshold, through July 
14, 2016, when he no longer held voting securities of Web.com valued in 
excess of $156.3 million.

REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests:
    a. That the Court adjudge and decree that Defendant's acquisition 
of Web.com voting securities on June 27, 2016, was a violation of the 
HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a; and that Defendant was in violation of the HSR 
Act each day from June 27, 2016, through July 14, 2016;
    b. That the Court order Defendant to pay to the United States an 
appropriate civil penalty as provided by the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. 
18a(g)(1), and the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-74, Sec.  701 (further amending 
the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990), and 
Federal Trade Commission Rule 1.98, 16 CFR 1.98, 81 FR 42,476 (June 30, 
2016);
    c. That the Court order such other and further relief as the Court 
may deem just and proper; and
    d. That the Court award Plaintiff its costs of this suit.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

    United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Ahmet H. Okumus, 
Defendant.
Case No.: 1:17-cv-00104
Judge: Rosemary M. Collyer
Filed: 01/17/2017

COMPETITIVE IMPACT STATEMENT

    The United States, pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and 
Penalties Act (``APPA''), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), files this Competitive 
Impact Statement to set forth the information necessary to enable the 
Court and the public to evaluate the proposed Final Judgment that would 
terminate this civil antitrust proceeding.

I. NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THIS PROCEEDING

    On January 17, 2017, the United States filed a Complaint against 
Defendant Ahmet H. Okumus (``Okumus''), related to Okumus's acquisition 
of voting securities of Web.com Group, Inc. (``Web.com'') in June 2016. 
The Complaint alleges that Okumus violated Section 7A of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, commonly known as the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act of 1976 (the ``HSR Act''). The HSR Act provides that 
``no person shall acquire, directly or indirectly, any voting 
securities of any person'' exceeding certain thresholds until that 
person has filed pre-acquisition notification and report forms with the 
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (collectively, 
the ``federal antitrust agencies'' or ``agencies'') and the post-filing 
waiting period has expired. 15 U.S.C. 18a(a). A key purpose of the 
notification and waiting period is to protect consumers and competition 
from potentially anticompetitive transactions by providing the agencies 
an opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of proposed transactions 
before they are consummated.
    The Complaint alleges that Okumus acquired voting securities of 
Web.com in excess of then-applicable statutory thresholds without 
making the required pre-acquisition HSR filings with the agencies and 
without observing the waiting period, and that Okumus and Web.com met 
the applicable statutory size of person thresholds.
    At the same time the Complaint was filed in the present action, the 
United States also filed a Stipulation and proposed Final Judgment that 
eliminates the need for a trial in this case. The proposed Final 
Judgment is designed to deter Okumus' HSR Act violations. Under the 
proposed Final Judgment, Okumus must pay a civil penalty to the United 
States in the amount of $180,000.
    The United States and the Defendant have stipulated that the 
proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA, 
unless the United States first withdraws its consent. Entry of the 
proposed Final Judgment would terminate this case, except that the 
Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, or enforce the 
provisions of the proposed Final Judgment and punish violations 
thereof.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF 
THE ANTITRUST LAWS

    Okumus is an investor with his principal office and place of 
business in New York City. At all times relevant to the Complaint, 
Okumus had sales or assets in excess of $156.3 million. At all times 
relevant to the Complaint, Web.com, a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, had sales or assets in excess 
of $15.6 million.
    On November 21, 2014, Okumus filed under the HSR Act to acquire 
voting securities of Web.com. Okumus filed at the $50 million 
threshold, as adjusted. After the waiting period expired, Okumus was 
permitted under the HSR Act to acquire additional voting securities of 
Web.com for five years without making a new HSR filing so long as his 
holdings did not exceed the $100 million threshold, as adjusted. On 
June 27, 2016, Okumus acquired additional voting securities of Web.com. 
As a result of this acquisition, Okumus held voting securities of 
Web.com valued at approximately $156.6 million, which was in excess of 
$156.3 million, the as adjusted $100 million threshold in effect at the 
time. Although he was required to do so under the HSR Act, Okumus 
failed to make an HSR filing and observe the statutory waiting period 
before consummating the June 27, 2016 acquisition.
    On July 14, 2016, Okumus sold voting securities of Web.com. As a 
result of this sale, he no longer held voting securities valued in 
excess of $156.3 million, and was no longer in violation of the HSR 
Act.
    The Complaint further alleges that Okumus's June 2016 HSR Act 
violation was not the first time Okumus had failed to observe the HSR 
Act's notification and waiting period requirements. On September 11, 
2014, Okumus acquired voting securities of Web.com. As a result of this 
acquisition, Okumus held approximately 13.5 percent of the voting 
securities of Web.com. Okumus did not file under the HSR Act prior to 
making this acquisition, relying on the exemption for acquisitions made 
solely for the purpose of investment. See 15 U.S.C. 18a(c)(9). However, 
the exemption is limited to acquisitions that result in holdings that 
do not exceed ten percent of the voting securities of the issuer; 
acquisitions that result in holding in excess of ten percent require an 
HSR filing regardless of the purpose of the acquisition. On November 
21, 2014, Okumus made a corrective HSR filing for the September 11, 
2014 acquisition, and explained in a letter accompanying the corrective 
filing that his failure to file was inadvertent. On December 31, 2014, 
the Premerger Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission 
notified Okumus by letter that it would not recommend a civil penalty 
for the violation, but advised Okumus that he was ``accountable for 
instituting an effective program to ensure full compliance with the 
Act's requirements.''

III. EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT

    The proposed Final Judgment imposes a $180,000 civil penalty 
designed to deter the Defendant and others from violating the HSR Act. 
The United States adjusted the penalty downward from the maximum 
permitted under the HSR Act because the violation was inadvertent, the 
Defendant promptly corrected the violation after discovery by selling 
voting securities, and the Defendant is willing to resolve the matter 
by consent decree and avoid prolonged investigation and litigation. The 
relief will have a beneficial effect on competition because the 
agencies will be properly notified of future acquisitions, in 
accordance with the law. At the same time, the penalty will not have 
any adverse effect on competition.

IV. REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO POTENTIAL PRIVATE LITIGANTS

    There is no private antitrust action for HSR Act violations; 
therefore, entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor 
assist the bringing of any private antitrust action.

V. PROCEDURES AVAILABLE FOR MODIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT

    The United States and the Defendant have stipulated that the 
proposed Final Judgment may be entered by this Court after compliance 
with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has 
not withdrawn its consent.

[[Page 8861]]

The APPA conditions entry of the decree upon this Court's determination 
that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.
    The APPA provides a period of at least sixty (60) days preceding 
the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which any 
person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the 
proposed Final Judgment. Any person who wishes to comment should do so 
within sixty (60) days of the date of publication of this Competitive 
Impact Statement in the Federal Register, or the last date of 
publication in a newspaper of the summary of this Competitive Impact 
Statement, whichever is later. All comments received during this period 
will be considered by the United States, which remains free to withdraw 
its consent to the proposed Final Judgment at any time prior to entry. 
The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with 
this Court. In addition, comments will be posted on the U.S. Department 
of Justice, Antitrust Division's internet Web site and, under certain 
circumstances, published in the Federal Register. Written comments 
should be submitted to:

Daniel P. Ducore
Special Attorney, United States
c/o Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.
CC-8416
Washington, DC 20580
Email: dducore@ftc.gov.

    The proposed Final Judgment provides that this Court retains 
jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to this Court 
for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification, 
interpretation, or enforcement of the Final Judgment.

VI. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT

    As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States 
considered pursuing a full trial on the merits against the Defendant. 
The United States is satisfied, however, that the proposed relief is an 
appropriate remedy in this matter. Given the facts of this case, 
including the Defendant's self-reporting of the violation and 
willingness to promptly settle this matter, the United States is 
satisfied that the proposed civil penalty is sufficient to address the 
violation alleged in the Complaint and to deter violations by similarly 
situated entities in the future, without the time, expense, and 
uncertainty of a full trial on the merits.

VII. STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER THE APPA FOR THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT

    The APPA requires proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases 
brought by the United States be subject to a sixty (60) day comment 
period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the 
proposed Final Judgment is ``in the public interest.'' 15 U.S.C. 
16(e)(1). In making that determination, the court, in accordance with 
the statute as amended in 2004, is required to consider:

    (A) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination 
of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, 
duration of relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies 
actually considered, whether its terms are ambiguous, and any other 
competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment 
that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the 
consent judgment is in the public interest; and
    (B) the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the 
relevant market or markets, upon the public generally and individuals 
alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint 
including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived 
from a determination of the issues at trial.

Id. Sec.  16(e)(1)(A) & (B). In considering these statutory factors, 
the court's inquiry is necessarily a limited one, as the government is 
entitled to ``broad discretion to settle with the defendant within the 
reaches of the public interest.'' United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 
F.3d 1448, 1461 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see generally United States v. SBC 
Commc'ns, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2007) (assessing public 
interest standard under the Tunney Act); United States v. U.S. Airways 
Group, Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 69, 75 (D.D.C. 2014) (noting that the 
court's ``inquiry is limited'' because the government has ``broad 
discretion'' to determine the adequacy of the relief secured through a 
settlement); United States v. InBev N.V./S.A., No. 08-1965 (JR), 2009-2 
Trade Cas. (CCH) ] 76,736, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *3 (D.D.C. 
Aug. 11, 2009) (noting that the court's review of a consent judgment is 
limited and only inquires ``into whether the government's determination 
that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged 
in the complaint was reasonable, and whether the mechanism to enforce 
the final judgment are clear and manageable.'').\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The 2004 amendments substituted ``shall'' for ``may'' in 
directing relevant factors for court to consider and amended the 
list of factors to focus on competitive considerations and to 
address potentially ambiguous judgment terms. Compare 15 U.S.C. 
Sec.  16(e) (2004), with 15 U.S.C. Sec.  16(e)(1) (2006); see also 
SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 11 (concluding that the 2004 
amendments ``effected minimal changes'' to Tunney Act review).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit has held, a court conducting an inquiry under the APPA may 
consider, among other things, the relationship between the remedy 
secured and the specific allegations set forth in the government's 
complaint, whether the decree is sufficiently clear, whether 
enforcement mechanisms are sufficient, and whether the decree may 
positively harm third parties. See Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1458-62. With 
respect to the adequacy of the relief secured by the decree, a court 
may not ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would 
best serve the public.'' United States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462 
(9th Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 
666 (9th Cir. 1981)); see also Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460-62; United 
States v. Alcoa, Inc., 152 F. Supp. 2d 37, 40 (D.D.C. 2001); InBev, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *3. Courts have held that:

[t]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by 
a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first 
instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role 
in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the 
government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the 
decree. The court is required to determine not whether a particular 
decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the 
settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More 
elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust 
enforcement by consent decree.
Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\2\ In 
determining whether a proposed settlement is in the public interest, a 
district court ``must accord deference to the government's predictions 
about the

[[Page 8862]]

efficacy of its remedies, and may not require that the remedies 
perfectly match the alleged violations.'' SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d 
at 17; see also U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 75 (noting that a court 
should not reject the proposed remedies because it believes others are 
preferable); Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 (noting the need for courts to 
be ``deferential to the government's predictions as to the effect of 
the proposed remedies''); United States v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., 
272 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2003) (noting that the court should grant 
due respect to the government's prediction as to the effect of proposed 
remedies, its perception of the market structure, and its views of the 
nature of the case).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Cf. BNS, 858 F.2d at 464 (holding that the court's 
``ultimate authority under the [APPA] is limited to approving or 
disapproving the consent decree''); United States v. Gillette Co., 
406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975) (noting that, in this way, the 
court is constrained to ``look at the overall picture not 
hypercritically, nor with a microscope, but with an artist's 
reducing glass''). See generally Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 
(discussing whether ``the remedies [obtained in the decree are] so 
inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall outside of the 
`reaches of the public interest' '').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Courts have greater flexibility in approving proposed consent 
decrees than in crafting their own decrees following a finding of 
liability in a litigated matter. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved 
even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own, 
as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the 
reaches of public interest.' '' United States v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 
552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982) (citations omitted) (quoting United 
States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975)), aff'd 
sub nom., Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983); see also 
U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 76 (noting that room must be made for 
the government to grant concessions in the negotiation process for 
settlements (citing Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461)); United States v. 
Alcan Aluminum Ltd., 605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky. 1985) (approving 
the consent decree even though the court would have imposed a greater 
remedy). To meet this standard, the United States ``need only provide a 
factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably 
adequate remedies for the alleged harms.'' SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 
2d at 17.
    Moreover, the court's role under the APPA is limited to reviewing 
the remedy in relationship to the violations that the United States has 
alleged in its Complaint, and does not authorize the court to 
``construct [its] own hypothetical case and then evaluate the decree 
against that case.'' Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459; see also U.S. Airways, 
38 F. Supp. 3d at 75 (noting that the court must simply determine 
whether there is a factual foundation for the government's decisions 
such that its conclusions regarding the proposed settlements are 
reasonable); InBev, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *20 (concluding 
that ``the `public interest' is not to be measured by comparing the 
violations alleged in the complaint against those the court believes 
could have, or even should have, been alleged''). Because the ``court's 
authority to review the decree depends entirely on the government's 
exercising its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first 
place,'' it follows that ``the court is only authorized to review the 
decree itself,'' and not to ``effectively redraft the complaint'' to 
inquire into other matters that the United States did not pursue. 
Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459-60. As this Court confirmed in SBC 
Communications, courts ``cannot look beyond the complaint in making the 
public interest determination unless the complaint is drafted so 
narrowly as to make a mockery of judicial power.'' 489 F. Supp. 2d at 
15.
    In its 2004 amendments, Congress made clear its intent to preserve 
the practical benefits of utilizing consent decrees in antitrust 
enforcement, adding the unambiguous instruction that ``[n]othing in 
this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an 
evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to 
intervene.'' 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(2); see also U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d 
at 76 (indicating that a court is not required to hold an evidentiary 
hearing or to permit intervenors as part of its review under the Tunney 
Act). This language codified what Congress intended when it enacted the 
Tunney Act in 1974, as the author of this legislation, Senator Tunney, 
explained: ``The court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage 
in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the 
benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent 
decree process.'' 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) (statement of Sen. 
Tunney). Rather, the procedure for the public interest determination is 
left to the discretion of the court, with the recognition that the 
court's ``scope of review remains sharply proscribed by precedent and 
the nature of Tunney Act proceedings.'' SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d 
at 11.\3\ A court can make its public interest determination based on 
the competitive impact statement and response to public comments alone. 
U.S. Airways, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 76.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See also United States v. Enova Corp., 107 F. Supp. 2d 10, 
17 (D.D.C. 2000) (noting that the ``Tunney Act expressly allows the 
court to make its public interest determination on the basis of the 
competitive impact statement and response to comments alone''); 
United States v. Mid-Am. Dairymen, Inc., No. 73-CV-681-W-1, 1977-1 
Trade Cas. (CCH) ] 61,508, at 71,980, *22 (W.D. Mo. 1977) (``Absent 
a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its 
duty, the Court, in making its public interest finding, should . . . 
carefully consider the explanations of the government in the 
competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order 
to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the 
circumstances.''); S. Rep. No. 93-298, at 6 (1973) (``Where the 
public interest can be meaningfully evaluated simply on the basis of 
briefs and oral arguments, that is the approach that should be 
utilized.'').

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

    United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Ahmet H. Okumus, 
Defendant.
Case No.: 1:17-cv-00104
Judge: Rosemary M. Collyer
Filed: 01/17/2017

1
Plaintiff Allaire Corporation ("Allaire") is a Delaware corporation.1 At all relevant times, Allaire's common stock was traded on the NASDAQ National Market. Defendant Ahmet H. Okumus directly or indirectly controls each of the other defendants (defendants collectively, "Okumus").


2
According to Allaire's complaint, Okumus wrote (sold) a set of call options on Allaire common stock on November 17, 2000. Three days later, on November 20, 2000, Okumus allegedly acquired a sufficient number of shares to become a statutory insider for purposes of section 16(b). On December 16, 2000, the November 17 calls expired unexercised. On January 16, 2001, Okumus wrote a second set of calls on Allaire common stock. Okumus allegedly remained a statutory insider throughout this period.


3
On March 18, 2003, Allaire brought suit against Okumus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Okumus was a "statutory insider" who was liable to Allaire under section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78p(b) (1994),2 for making short-swing trades in Allaire common stock or its equivalent. Relying on rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that govern section 16(b)'s applicability to transactions in derivative securities, Allaire alleges that the expiration of the November calls in December constituted a "purchase" of Allaire stock, and that the writing of a new set of calls in January constituted a "sale" of Allaire stock. Allaire argues that these two transactions ought to be matched with one another as a basis for holding Okumus liable under section 16(b) for the profits Okumus generated from them. See Rule 16a-1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-1; Rule 16b-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.16b-6.


4
The district court (Thomas P. Griesa, Judge) dismissed the action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Allaire Corp. v. Okumus, No. 03 Civ.1901, 2004 WL 719178, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5576 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2004). The court concluded that the expiration of the first set of calls was not a purchase under SEC Rule 16b-6 and that the plaintiff had therefore failed to state a claim under section 16(b).

Allaire appeals.

DISCUSSION
I. Standard of Review

6
"We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff's favor." Scutti Enters., LLC. v. Park Place Entm't. Corp., 322 F.3d 211, 214 (2d Cir.2003). A complaint may not be dismissed under the Rule "unless it appears beyond doubt, even when the complaint is liberally construed, that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

II. Section 16(b)

7
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78p(b), provides that statutory insiders of a corporation will forfeit any profits they make as a result of their "short-swing" trades in the equity securities of the corporation. It reads:


8
For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner . . . by reason of his relationship to the issuer, any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of such issuer (other than an exempted security) within any period of less than six months . . . shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner . . . in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six months. . . . This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.


9
15 U.S.C. § 78p(b) (1994).


10
Section 16(a) defines "insider" for these purposes as any person "who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 per centum of any class of any equity security (other than an exempted security) which is registered pursuant to § 781 of this title." 15 U.S.C. § 78p(a) (1994). A "short swing" trade is a sale and a purchase of such equity security made within six months of each other. See 15 U.S.C. § 78p(b). Under the facts as alleged by Allaire, Okumus was a statutory insider from November 20, 2000, through February 16, 2001, when he divested himself of all his equity interest in Allaire.


11
The SEC has, by regulation, defined the term "equity security" to mean "any equity security or derivative security relating to an issuer, whether or not issued by that issuer." 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-1(d). Any purchase (or its equivalent) of an equity security in a corporation may be matched with any sale (or its equivalent) of such a security, provided the transactions occur within six months of each other. Magma Power Co. v. Dow Chem. Co., 136 F.3d 316, 320 (2d Cir.1998). "The statutory definitions of `purchase' and `sale' are broad and, at least arguably, reach many transactions not ordinarily deemed a sale or purchase." Kern County Land Co. v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 411 U.S. 582, 593-94, 93 S. Ct. 1736, 36 L. Ed. 2d 503 (1973).

III. Rule 16b-6(a)

12
In 1991, the SEC issued regulations to govern the application of section 16(b) to derivative securities.3 See Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Exchange Act Release No. 34-28869, Investment Company Act Release No. 35-25254, 56 Fed.Reg. 7242-01, 7248 (Feb. 21, 1991) ("[T]he Commission is adopting a comprehensive regulatory framework, in order to effect the purposes of section 16 and to address the proliferation of derivative securities and the popularity of exchange-traded options."). Rule 16b-6(a) provides in relevant part:


13
The establishment of or increase in a call equivalent position or liquidation of or decrease in a put equivalent position shall be deemed a purchase of the underlying security for purposes of section 16(b) of the Act, and the establishment of or increase in a put equivalent position or liquidation of or decrease in a call equivalent position shall be deemed a sale of the underlying securities for purposes of section 16(b) of the Act . . . .


14
Id., 17 C.F.R. § 240.16b-6(a). The principal issue before us on appeal is whether, under Rule 16b-6(a), the expiration of a short call option is a purchase, thereby exposing its insider/writer to section 16(b) liability if within six months after that expiration he or she also wrote (sold) another such call option.


15
Allaire's reading of Rule 16b-6(a) would require an affirmative answer to that question. Allaire points out that another section of the applicable regulations defines the term "put equivalent position" as "a derivative security position that increases in value as the value of the underlying equity decreases, including, but not limited to, a long put option and a short call option position." 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-1(h). A party establishes a short call option position by writing a call option. In doing so, the writer obligates him- or herself to sell the security to the holder of the option (who is then in a "long" position with respect to the securities) at the agreed-upon "strike price" whenever the holder demands it, except no later than the date the option expires. The value of the writer's "derivative security position" does indeed "increase[] in value as the value of the underlying equity decreases," id., because the likelihood that the writer will be able to pocket the premium the purchaser paid him or her for the right to purchase the shares without the purchaser ever exercising that right increases as the value of the underlying equity decreases.4 If the option does expire unexercised — presumably because the market price was below the strike price when the purchaser might otherwise have executed it — the writer's obligation to sell the security ceases, terminating his or her put equivalent position. Such an expiration, Allaire urges us to conclude, represents a "liquidation of or decrease in a put equivalent position" and is therefore a "purchase" under Rule 16b-6(a). As a purchase, it must be matched with the set of calls Okumus wrote on Allaire's stock on January 16, 2001, which is a "sale." Allaire argues that there is thus a purchase and a sale sufficient to give rise to liability under section 16(b).


16
Although this reading of Rule 16b-6(a) is not implausible, it appears to contradict the statutory purpose of holding traders liable only for those transactions in which they can exploit their inside information for their own profit. We have previously held that "the exercise of a fixed-price option is a non-event for 16(b) purposes . . . because the insider by then is already bound by the terms of the option, [so] the potential for abuse of inside information is minimal." Magma Power, 136 F.3d at 322. A fortiori, when the option is written by the insider (and not canceled), leaving the insider with no control over whether or not it will be exercised, his or her inside information, at least in the usual case, cannot be employed for his or her personal profit. Thus, neither the holder's exercise of the option nor the holder's allowing the option to expire constitutes a transaction by the option's writer.


17
For this reason, the district court correctly concluded that the references in Rule 16b-6(a) to the "establishment" and "liquidation" of call and put equivalent positions refer not to the expiration of an option but rather to the initial transaction between the writer and the holder. Allaire Corp., 2004 WL 719178, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5576, at *9. Under the district court's view, which we share, section 16(b) covers only the transaction in which the parties agree to the terms of sale, because that is the one in which the writer of the option can be deemed to be using his or her inside information to arrive at the option's terms on a favorable basis. Just as the holder's exercise of a call option is not a "sale" by the writer under Rule 16b-6(a), neither is the expiration of a call option a "purchase" by the writer under that provision.


18
Allaire concedes that a holder's exercise of an option is a "non-event" for the writer, but it attempts to distinguish the exercise of an option from its expiration. While the writer has no control over whether the holder exercises the option, Allaire argues, "the seller (writer) of the option has the choice at any point from the writing of the option until the exercise date to close out the position by buying back the option." Appellant's Br. at 15 (emphasis in original). By the same logic, however, an insider could be held liable under section 16(b) without having been involved in any transaction because such a person always has a "choice" as to whether to buy and sell stock within six months. The issue is not what the option writer might have done. It is what he or she in fact did.

IV. Rule 16b-6(d)

19
Even if Allaire's interpretation of Rule 16b-6(a) were consistent with the purposes of section 16(b), it cannot be squared with other portions of the SEC regulations governing section 16(b) liability for derivatives. Cf. United Savs. Ass'n of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assoc., Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S. Ct. 626, 98 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1988) ("A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme — because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meaning clear. . . .") (citation omitted).


20
Allaire relies principally on Rule 16b-6(a), but only one subsection of Rule 16b-6 refers explicitly to the legal consequences of the expiration of an option. Rule 16b-6(d) provides in part:


21
Upon cancellation or expiration of an option within six months of the writing of the option, any profit derived from writing the option shall be recoverable under section 16(b) of the Act. The profit shall not exceed the premium received for writing the option.


22
Id. Under this provision, if an insider writes an option that expires unexercised within six months and profits from doing so on account of having been paid by the purchaser for a right to buy shares that the purchaser did not exercise, the writer will be held liable under section 16(b) for the amount the purchaser paid him or her for the option. See Gwozdzinsky v. Zell/Chilmark Fund, L.P., 156 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir.1998) ("[U]nder Rule 16b-6(d), any insider who writes a put option on securities of the issuer is liable under Section 16(b) to the extent of any premium received for writing the option if the option is either cancelled or expires unexercised within six months of its writing, an event that is deemed a `sale' for purposes of Section 16(b).") (citing Rule 16b-6(d)).


23
Allaire's reading of Rule 16b-6(a) would render this rule, 16b-6(d), superfluous. If the expiration of a call option were a purchase under Rule 16b-6(a), what purpose would it serve to provide, as Rule 16b-6(d) does, that the expiration of an option within six months of its writing triggers liability? Such an event would be covered by Rule 16b-6(a). Cf. State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir.2003) ("It is well-settled that courts should avoid statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous. . . .").


24
Allaire bases its reading of Rule 16b-6(a) in large measure on its definition of a sale as including the "liquidation of or decrease in a call equivalent position." 17 C.F.R. § 240.16b-6(a). But if the SEC had intended Rule 16b-6(a) to govern expirations, the SEC would presumably have used the word "expiration" to do so. Indeed, the explicit reference to "expiration of an option" in Rule 16b-6(d) indicates that the SEC was aware of the potential significance of an option's expiration, suggesting that its omission from Rule 16b-6(a) was likely intentional. Cf. Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 711 n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718 (2004) (rejecting government's request to read a provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act that did not contain the words "act or omission" as if it did when other parts of the Act did contain those words, thus proving that "Congress knew how to specify `act or omission' when it wanted to").


25
By its terms, Rule 16b-6(d) plainly does not cover the trades Okumus is alleged to have made. This provision directs that the writer of an option may be held liable for any profit derived from the expiration of that same option within six months. Here, the January 16 calls Okumus wrote were for a different set of shares than those that expired on December 16. Therefore, those two events do not trigger liability under Rule 16b-6(d).5


26
The SEC has itself lent support to this view. In response to a letter from the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell requesting guidance as to the applicability of Rule 16b-6 to the expiration of an option more than six months after its writing, the SEC took the position that "the expiration of a call option more than six months following the date on which it was written would be the exempt closing of a derivative security position with respect to the writer in circumstances where no value is given in consideration for the expiration." Sullivan & Cromwell, SEC No-Action Letter, 1993 WL 485927, at *3, 1993 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 1100, at *1 (Nov. 19, 1993). It further concluded that "such an expiration would not be construed as a purchase by the writer, resulting from the decrease in a put equivalent position pursuant to Rule 16b-6(a), that may be matched with another transaction by the writer pursuant to Rule 16b-6(c)(2)." Id., 1993 WL 485927, at *3, 1993 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 1100, at *1-*2 (emphasis added).


27
The SEC no-action letter does not bind us, but we find it persuasive. See Mony Group, Inc. v. Highfields Capital Mgmt., L.P., 368 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that no-action letters may be relied upon for their persuasiveness). Here, the letter confirms our view that the writing of an option may be a "transaction" under section 16(b) but that the expiration of an option, when matched against any transaction other than its own writing, is not.

CONCLUSION

28
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.



Notes:


1
 Allaire is the successor-in-interest to another Delaware corporation, also named "Allaire Corporation," but there is no need to distinguish between the two for purposes of resolving this appeal


2
 Section 16, 15 U.S.C. § 78p, was amended in 2000. P.L. 106-554 (effective date Dec. 21). The expiration at issue in this case occurred on December 16, 2000, and the second sale of calls occurred on January 16, 2001. We therefore look to the statute in effect as of December 16, 2000. We note, however, that the 2000 amendment does not affect the law at issue on this appeal. Both the plaintiff and the defendants refer to the amended version of the statute in their arguments, as did the district court in its opinion


3
 "[D]erivative securities [are] financial instruments that derive their value (hence the name) from an underlying security or index."Magma Power Co., 136 F.3d at 321. A call option gives its holder the right to purchase shares of an equity from the option seller at a specified strike price. See Black's Law Dictionary 1127 (8th ed.2004). It is a derivative security because its value derives from the price of the security for which the calls are issued.


4
 By the same token, the writer faces a loss if and when the market price of the underlying security rises above the option's strike price, because he or she will be forced to sell the shares to the purchaser for below market value


5
 Rule 16b-6(c) also appears to undermine Allaire's interpretation. It sets forth the method for calculating an insider's profit from short-swing trade pairs consisting of at least one option transaction. The provision does not provide a method for calculating profit where an option's expiration is one half of the transaction pair in question. If the SEC thought an expiration ordinarily may give rise to insider's liability when paired with any other purchase or sale, why did it not give so much as a hint in Rule 16b-6(c) as to the proper means of calculating the insider's profit?
