Our Mission is to Revolutionize Travel Through the Power of Technology






Our Strategy




We want to own and power the best travel brands in the world.  We want our brands to be independent, innovative, fast.   We want them relentlessly focused on what drives value for their customers.
We are aggressive.  We will grow and take share from our competitors.  Our primary growth drivers will be technology and product innovation, customer loyalty, global expansion, and channel penetration.
Together as a family our competitive advantages are:

The best supply position in the world
Scale in our world class technology and operations platforms
Unsurpassed intelligence through sharing of our smart people, insight, and best practices

 

Cultural Norms




We Believe in Being Different: We seek new ideas, different ways of thinking, diverse backgrounds and approaches, because averages can lie and sameness is dangerous. Because of this belief, our norms aren’t rules or universal at all corners of our company. But they are important to our identity and how we work together. Like our company, these norms will evolve.
We Lead Humbly: Our leaders serve their teams. None of us has all of the answers, but we are curious and we are always looking to learn. Though our leaders take their responsibilities to our business and their teams incredibly seriously, they never take themselves too seriously.
We are Transparent: We communicate openly and honestly, at all levels, upwards, sideways and downwards. We surface difficult issues quickly, we act, we learn.
We Organize for Speed: We seek to gather data as fast as possible, and move. Speed allows us to make mistakes and constantly improve.
We Believe in the Scientific Method: Everyone’s ideas are equal in the face of hard data. We use data to guide but not define our actions.
We Act as One Team: We look to optimize for the greater good, not just our own, or even our own teams’ interests. We are actively interested in the success of others.

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

Trivago shares rise after full-year outlook lifted
Trivago NV  gained in the extended session Thursday after the online hotel booking site raised its outlook for the year following the earnings release of majority shareholder Expedia Inc. . U.S. shares of Düsseldorf, Germany-based Trivago rose 3.8% to $15.80 after hours. "Given our strong start to the year, we have increased our full-year guidance and now expect annual revenue growth to be around 50% in 2017," said Trivago Chief Financial Officer Axel Hefer in a statement. Trivago reports quarterly results on May 15. Expedia shares slipped 2% after hours as the online travel company's earnings missed Wall Street estimates by a penny.

Trivago shares rise after full-year outlook lifted
Trivago NV  gained in the extended session Thursday after the online hotel booking site raised its outlook for the year following the earnings release of majority shareholder Expedia Inc. . U.S. shares of Düsseldorf, Germany-based Trivago rose 3.8% to $15.80 after hours. "Given our strong start to the year, we have increased our full-year guidance and now expect annual revenue growth to be around 50% in 2017," said Trivago Chief Financial Officer Axel Hefer in a statement. Trivago reports quarterly results on May 15. Expedia shares slipped 2% after hours as the online travel company's earnings missed Wall Street estimates by a penny.

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
