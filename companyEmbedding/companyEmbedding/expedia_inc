I told her that I was driving and I would pull over as soon as possible to check my bank info.   I made the reservation online & chose the option to pay at the hotel, there was  no reason to authorize my card.  I tried to call the # that the clerk had called from and got a busy signal, so I attempted to get the direct # to the hotel off the internet.  The only #'s available are for the reservation hotline and they did not have access to the direct # to the hotel.  Keep in mind that I am driving and my husband is getting more and more frustrated.  FINALLY found the direct # to the hotel and asked for the desk clerk, only to be told that she was out running errands and would be back in about a  half an hour.  I explained to the young girl my earlier conversation and told her they had the wrong card # and that is why it wouldn't authorize.  She asked how far we were from the hotel and I told her 35 miles (we had at this point been dealing with the for a half an hour) and she told us that it would be easier for her (!!!) to just ake care of it when we got there.  Are you kidding me?    When we arrived we checked in-but when got to our room and the AC didn't work-so BACK to the desk and then to another room.  But neither the key worked.  BACK to the desk.  We left to eat at the time we should have been in bed!  I was in town for an early meeting.

Our Mission is to Revolutionize Travel Through the Power of Technology






Our Strategy




We want to own and power the best travel brands in the world.  We want our brands to be independent, innovative, fast.   We want them relentlessly focused on what drives value for their customers.
We are aggressive.  We will grow and take share from our competitors.  Our primary growth drivers will be technology and product innovation, customer loyalty, global expansion, and channel penetration.
Together as a family our competitive advantages are:

The best supply position in the world
Scale in our world class technology and operations platforms
Unsurpassed intelligence through sharing of our smart people, insight, and best practices

 

Cultural Norms




We Believe in Being Different: We seek new ideas, different ways of thinking, diverse backgrounds and approaches, because averages can lie and sameness is dangerous. Because of this belief, our norms aren’t rules or universal at all corners of our company. But they are important to our identity and how we work together. Like our company, these norms will evolve.
We Lead Humbly: Our leaders serve their teams. None of us has all of the answers, but we are curious and we are always looking to learn. Though our leaders take their responsibilities to our business and their teams incredibly seriously, they never take themselves too seriously.
We are Transparent: We communicate openly and honestly, at all levels, upwards, sideways and downwards. We surface difficult issues quickly, we act, we learn.
We Organize for Speed: We seek to gather data as fast as possible, and move. Speed allows us to make mistakes and constantly improve.
We Believe in the Scientific Method: Everyone’s ideas are equal in the face of hard data. We use data to guide but not define our actions.
We Act as One Team: We look to optimize for the greater good, not just our own, or even our own teams’ interests. We are actively interested in the success of others.

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

I told her that I was driving and I would pull over as soon as possible to check my bank info.   I made the reservation online & chose the option to pay at the hotel, there was  no reason to authorize my card.  I tried to call the # that the clerk had called from and got a busy signal, so I attempted to get the direct # to the hotel off the internet.  The only #'s available are for the reservation hotline and they did not have access to the direct # to the hotel.  Keep in mind that I am driving and my husband is getting more and more frustrated.  FINALLY found the direct # to the hotel and asked for the desk clerk, only to be told that she was out running errands and would be back in about a  half an hour.  I explained to the young girl my earlier conversation and told her they had the wrong card # and that is why it wouldn't authorize.  She asked how far we were from the hotel and I told her 35 miles (we had at this point been dealing with the for a half an hour) and she told us that it would be easier for her (!!!) to just ake care of it when we got there.  Are you kidding me?    When we arrived we checked in-but when got to our room and the AC didn't work-so BACK to the desk and then to another room.  But neither the key worked.  BACK to the desk.  We left to eat at the time we should have been in bed!  I was in town for an early meeting.

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

3. This offer does not apply to multi-activity bookings.
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Subject to the restrictions set out in these terms and conditions and compliance with the above, the coupon code may be applied to activity bookings  made online with expedia.com.  This coupon may not be used for package bookings (e.g. flight + hotel + car packages or packages offered by third parties), stand-alone hotels, or stand-alone flights. The coupon code can only be used for pre-pay bookings and cannot be redeemed against bookings which are paid at the destination.
The coupon code cannot be redeemed against activities at: Walt Disney World, Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris, Universal Studios Hollywood, and Universal Studios Orlando. The list of activities for qualifying bookings may change at any time.
The coupon code may only be used in relation to the first activity booked on an eligible single booking.  This means that where the eligible booking includes more than one activity, the coupon code will only be applied against the first activity in the booking.
Provided that you spend a minimum of $100 USD (the price of the booking excluding any taxes, fees or additional costs) in one booking, the coupon code entitles you to $20 off the price of the relevant activity reservation before the application of any taxes, applicable fees or additional costs.

History[edit]
Founded as a division of Microsoft in October 1996, Expedia was spun off in 1999.
In 2003, it was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.[6]
In August 2005, IAC spun off Expedia Inc., which owned its travel group of businesses, including Expedia, Expedia Corporate Travel (now Egencia), TripAdvisor, Classic Vacations, eLong, Hotels.com, and Hotwire.com.[7]
In December 2011, Expedia, Inc. spun out TripAdvisor Media Group, retaining its portfolio of travel transaction brands.[8]
On December 21, 2012, Expedia bought a majority stake in travel metasearch engine Trivago in a combined cash and stock deal worth €477 million (approximately $630 million).[9][10][11]
In 2012, Expedia's Egencia unit acquired Via Travel, the largest travel company in Norway.[12] The acquisition boosted Expedia's total sales, making it the top earning travel company for 2013.
In 2014, Expedia acquired Wotif.com for $658 million.[13]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity from Sabre Corp for $280 million. Expedia previously partnered with Travelocity to provide the technology platform for Travelocity's US and Canada points of sale.[14]
In 2015, Expedia acquired Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash.[15]
In 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion.[16]
In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia. In her newly named position, Mrs. Clinton will get $45,000 a year in cash, plus $250,000 a year in stock vesting over three years. What Mrs. Clinton’s responsibilities will be at the online travel-booking company is unclear.[17][18]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Expedia's first acquisition was Travelscape for US$89.75 million and VacationSpot.com for US$80 million on March 17, 2000. It subsequently acquired Classic Custom Vacations in March 2002 for $78 million. The company has made four divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. On December 31, 2000, Technology Crossover Ventures acquired a 7% minority stake in Expedia for $50 million. USA Networks acquired a 65% majority stake in the company on February 5, 2002, for $1.372 billion, and a year later, on August 8, 2003, USA Interactive acquired Expedia for $3.636 billion. Expedia was ultimately spun off as a separate entity with a value of $7.981 billion. The company made the most acquisitions in 2002, when it acquired three companies: Classic Custom Vacations, Metropolitan Travel, and Newtrade Technologies.[19]
In January 2015, Expedia acquired the online travel agency Travelocity from the tech firm Sabre Corporation for $280 million.[20]

South Carolina sales tax suit[edit]
On 18 January 2011 Travelscape, a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. based in Las Vegas, was ordered to pay $6.3 million in back sales taxes to South Carolina by the state's supreme court. Travelscape argued that South Carolina's efforts to tax online retailers located out-of-state violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a unanimous ruling the court determined that the company has a presence in the state sufficient to be required to collect sales tax. While Travelscape does not have physical facilities in South Carolina, the court determined that frequent sales trips made by its employees and the fact that the company furnished hotel rooms in the state establish its presence for tax purposes.[40]
Office locations[edit]
Expedia Inc. maintains headquarters in downtown Bellevue, Washington, in a building named the Expedia Building. Expedia occupies floors 3 to 19 (and part of 20) of the 20 floor building, which completed construction in 2008. Initially, it was widely speculated that Google wanted to occupy most of the building, but a crane accident in 2006 caused delay and Google backed out of the project.[41]
On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[42][43][44] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate 4,500 employees, designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.[45][46]
The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[47] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.[48]
Accolades[edit]
In 2008, Expedia was named to the most admired Internet companies in the United States list, released by Fortune. Expedia ranked third, after IAC and Google, and was followed by Amazon.com at fourth place.[49] National Travel, an affiliate of American Express Travel, announced it has added Expedia Vacations to its suite of travel vendors.
For 2008, Expedia was ranked #3 in the Internet Service/Retailing industry on Fortune Most Admired List, and was included in the list of most-admired companies in the state of Washington.[49]
In 2008 Expedia Inc. was named one of "America's Best Managed Companies" by Forbes, its list of the 400 best managed, public American companies with $1 billion or more in revenues included Expedia for the first time.[50]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
