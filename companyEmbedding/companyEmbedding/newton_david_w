I decided to attend law school when I was living in Vermont, doing environmental work, and I saw that the lawyers held so many of the important keys. I decided that if I was going to make a difference in this world, I had to be a lawyer.My career took a slightly different turn than I would have predicted. I became a litigator, working primarily on personal injury cases, and also business and insurance cases.I love solving problems. I enjoy helping my clients solve their problems, whether it is recovering money for injuries, business wrongs, or the bad faith of insurance companies. I like digging out the details, especially the ones that others are trying to hide. And I enjoy the courtroom.Before you hire a lawyer, you should be comfortable with the person and satisfied that he or she has the skills and determination to get the job done. It is just as important to me that we have a strong relationship from the very start. If we do, it will last for the entire case.Being a lawyer has allowed me to contribute to our community in several ways. In the legal profession, I have had the honor of being the President of the Massachusetts Bar Association for the 2007-2008 term and receiving the Massachusetts Bar Association President's Award in 2017. I have had a chance to speak on behalf of lawyers and Massachusetts citizens at the State House, in the courts, and in many public forums. I have had a chance to be a strong advocate for preserving the rights of injury victims.I have also had the chance to work on environmental issues which have long been dear to me. I have been able to urge lawyers to fight global warming, leading the  Lawyers' Eco-Challenge. I have given back directly to my home town of Westwood, where I founded the Westwood Land Trust, Inc., and where I chaired the town’s open space committee. The two groups have raised millions of dollars and have preserved hundreds of acres of land in town. In 2013, I was appointed to the town's Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Committee; I look forward to advancing those causes in my home town.I look forward to working with you on your case, and helping you every way I can.

		This book introduces the foundations of a distinctively Christian approach to counseling.Christians who counsel, counselors who are Christian--what is the difference? What makes Christian counseling distinctive from secular counseling approaches? In this book, Malony and Augsburger introduce the substance and method, including family systems methodology, of Christian counseling as a major voice. The book also includes how to do a faith assessment; how to collaborate, consult, and refer; the centrality of Christ in the counseling process; how to address issues of sexual and cultural diversity with sensitivity; and the destiny of Christian counseling. H. Newton Malony, Ph.D. is Senior Professor at the Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California.David W. Augsburger, Ph.D. is Professor of Pastoral Care and Counseling, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California
