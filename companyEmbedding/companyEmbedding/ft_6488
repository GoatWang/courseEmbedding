Product Features:


Covered under Kohler's limited lifetime warranty
Single basin design provides maximum workspace
The Whitehaven apron-front sink features a streamlined and versatile farmhouse style
A large basin accommodates large pots and pans, while the sloped bottom helps with draining and clean-up
Constructed of enameled cast iron, which combines strength, durability, and insulation benefits
Undermount installation with apron front gives an integrated, graceful look to the sink

Product Technologies / Benefits:


Enameled Cast-Iron:  Kohler Enameled Cast-Iron combines the strength, durability, and insulation benefits of cast-iron with the scratch, chip, and burn resistance of a baked, powder coat finish and comes with an exceptional Lifetime Limited Warranty. When these materials are combined it gives the sink or tub the strength to last a lifetime of use. Kohler Enameled Cast-Iron is also available in a wide variety of specialty colors allowing you to truly customize your home.

Apron Front: Kohler apron front sinks have a stylish panel in front and are available in both drop-in (also called tile-in) and undermount configurations. Sometimes called a "farmhouse sink", this beautiful style evokes the charm of a traditional kitchen and can be installed with only minor modifications to existing kitchen cabinetry and countertops.
Self-Trimming: A style of apron front sink design in which the apron overlaps a portion of the existing kitchen cabinetry. This allows the installation of an apron front sink with only minor countertop modification.
