Veterinary firm corrals sweet payday in sale to Mars.(DEALS OF THE WEEK: A look at the companies that signed on the dotted line...

..... The candy
conglomerate paid $93 a share for VCA and took on $1.4 billion of
VCA's existing debt in addition to $7.7 billion in cash it shelled
out for the veterinary and laboratory diagnostic company.
The deal represents a huge premium for shareholders, which include
VCA's trio of co-founders: brothers Robert and Art Antin and their
friend and business partner Neil Tauber, who formed the company in 1986.
All three are still executives at VCA--Bob Antin, 65, serves as chairman
and chief executive; Art Antin, 69, is chief financial officer; and
Tauber, 65, serves as head of development--and will continue to run the
company as an independent unit of Mars going forward. .....
