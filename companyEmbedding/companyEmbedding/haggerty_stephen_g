CHICAGO | Global Hyatt Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Hoplamazian today announced the appointment of Stephen G. Haggerty as Executive Vice President, Real Estate and Development.

In his new role, Haggerty will be responsible for Hyatt’s strategic global development efforts through both acquisition and management agreements, and he will lead the capital investment and asset management programs for Hyatt-owned real estate. Haggerty will oversee the expansion and development of all Global Hyatt brands, including Hyatt Regency, Grand Hyatt, Park Hyatt, Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, Hyatt Place, Hyatt Summerfield Suites, Hyatt’s newest brand, Andaz, as well as Hyatt Vacation Ownership, Inc. and US Franchise Systems, Inc.

A senior executive with a diverse background and extensive experience in the hospitality industry, Haggerty joins Hyatt from Marriott International, Inc. where he worked for the past 13 years, most recently in London as Senior Vice President, International Project Finance and Asset Management for Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
“Steve joins the Global Hyatt team at a very exciting time,” Hoplamazian said. “Over the past several years, we have achieved significant growth through a number of acquisitions, the addition of management contracts in key destinations, and through the successful repositioning of key Hyatt-owned assets as part of a major capital investment strategy. I am confident that with his global industry experience and financial and strategic development expertise, Steve will be a key catalyst in further accelerating Hyatt’s growth.”
After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1990, Haggerty joined HVS International as a lodging consultant, both at the company’s headquarters and later assisting with the establishment of its London office. He later joined Marriott International and served in its Feasibility Department at its U.S. headquarters, followed by a transfer to Hong Kong to start Marriott’s Feasibility and Market Planning group for Asia / Pacific. There, he helped lead the company’s Asia / Pacific feasibility and development efforts over the course of nine years in the region. Prior to his most recent Marriott International post, he served as the Company’s Senior Vice President of Global Asset Management and Finance, based in Bethesda, Maryland.
“Hyatt enjoys strong brand presence with increasing share in key high growth markets,” remarked Haggerty. “Its launch of three new brands this year, coupled with its base of solid core brands and a strong team of development professionals around the world has significantly enhanced Hyatt’s growth potential. This is a tremendous opportunity for me to continue to strengthen that growth momentum and one which I look forward to embracing.”
Haggerty will relocate to Chicago with his family.
