Verified Purchase

Bad experience



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Jun 12, 2016    


We thought we had a good buy. Maybe we are unlucky but it turned out the handle didn't want to click into its gear most of the time. This made me end up with a hot basket in my hand and I couldn't do anything while everything inside needed to get out. Also the oil cooked out of the pan, without overfilling.

Great and versatile deep fryer



 



5 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Feb 23, 2016    


I love this fryer, it was just what I was looking for. I wanted one with a lid and a steam alter so I'm not making a greasy mess of my kitchen ceiling or cupboards. The user instructions state this fryer cannot be used with solid fats, but I've filled mine with coconut oil and it fries brilliantly! I wish it did go a little bit hotter but the best way to mitigate sogginess is to not overfill the basket. Unfortunately this means you can't do a lot in one go, but the unit is a nice compact size and fits nicely on a bench top without taking up a lot of space. The fold-away handle is such a great idea! No awkward things poking out. Really easy to clean too.

Had many fryers, this one is the cheapest and the best by miles. Easy to clean (no stainless steel exterior which shows ever mark) ,stays cool on the exterior and solidly constructed and looks good on the bench top not to mention cooks perfectly every time. Highly recommend!!!!! If you love deep frying you can't go wrong with this unit and you can get them for $69!!

        reviewed on Aug 09, 2015    


The lid has come off the hinges and the timer just stopped working last week.  We've had it a year and it's disappointing that it did this just after the warranty ran out.
I'm not sure if I will buy another one as I would want it to last longer than a year.

More than I expected

        reviewed on Feb 05, 2014    


Great fryer worked perfectly out of the box.  I bought this model because it had a small foot print on my counter. It works well, I like how you close off the lid so you avoid splashes from the oil. So easy to use an dsafe my kids can use.  Have cooked spring rolls, chips and chicken wings very well.  I also got it for a bargain price.

I'm tickled pink with my brand new deep fryer.



 



5 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Aug 29, 2012    


Well! I was overly excited in receiving this gift off my beautiful daughter and family for Christmas. I opened it and started, using it; straightaway.  It was so easy to use, I felt spoilt.  The lid closed to keep heat in, the handle adjusted for quick inspection. The timer is incredibly smashing.  All in all I was gob smacked.  I'm loving it big time with no complaints.

                More pros than cons, it was just divine, I tick all boxes.

                Nothing, absolutely nothing...it was intended as a gift and it was received as one, I'm hooked.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

 Create your very own fried food from the comfort of your own home with a fryer. All our deep fat fryers come with a removable bowl that is ideal for both serving and cleaning. We also have some great offers on health fryers including Tefal Actifry , which offer a healthier option to frying but still gives you that great fried crunch and taste. The Actifry only requires one spoonful of oil and can be used for many different foods including stir-fries and curries. A traditional chip fryer is a safer way to fry chips and is safer than using a pan. With a built in cool zone it means it won't get hot on the outside.
Complete your new kitchen with some more of our great appliances. We have everything you could want from coffee machines for delicious tasting coffee to slow cookers, perfect for preparing a tasty meal over night or whilst at work. Make fresh bread to accompany your meals with our fantastic breadmakers and fast boiling kettles for when you want to take a break. We even have many party food appliances including an ice cream machine and a popcorn maker, now you can make your favourite snacks yourself in a matter of minutes. All appliances come in a variety of styles and designs, so your kitchen is sure to be as functional as it is great-looking!
