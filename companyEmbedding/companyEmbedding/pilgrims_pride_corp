OUR HISTORY
The story began on October 2, 1946, when Aubrey Pilgrim and his partner, Pat Johns, purchased a feed and seed store for $3,500 from W. W. Weems in Pittsburg, Texas. Soon after forming the partnership, Aubrey asked his brother, Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim, to join them.
The Early Days
In the early days, the Pilgrims would sell 100 baby chicks and a sack of feed to local farmers who would take the chicks home and raise them in their back yards, keeping some for family needs and bringing back the remainder when they were grown. Selling baby chicks to drive feed sales was one of several innovative ideas that would later lead to the "vertical integration" model of poultry production used by nearly every major poultry company today.
Overcoming Obstacles
The Pilgrim brothers faced a number of tremendous challenges in building their new business.
"There was nothing remotely close to a long-range plan, a strategic plan, or a business plan associated with Farmer's Feed and Seed," Bo recalled. "I doubt if there was even very much time for daydreaming about a future. We were working long hours, sometimes hauling a load of peas over to the Cass County Canning Co. in Atlanta, Texas, not getting home until three o'clock in the morning, then getting to the store to open it at seven o'clock. The fact is, it was all about survival. Survival meant meeting a customer's expectations so the customer would become a return customer."
He soon learned not only to survive, but also how make a business grow.
"The first year I was with my brother as a partner, we added a warehouse to the store and, with it, a loading ramp, unloading pit, an elevator to carry feed to a bagging machine, and an electric sewing machine for the feed sacks," he said.
Bo's early process improvements allowed the company to dramatically reduce wasted grain, which used to be lost through the cracks of the floor in the feed store, and enabled the Pilgrim brothers to use automation to sell truckloads of feed out of the warehouse.
"We began to grow in a way that, looking back, was a set of small but integrated steps. We didn't know it at the time, of course, that our steps were linked in some way. We were simply responding to one opportunity after the next. In retrospect, the pieces of a fairly elaborate puzzle were beginning to fall into place," said Bo.
       
The puzzle soon began to take shape as opportunities came in the form of acquisitions and capital improvements. The first major expansion came in the 1950s, when the Pilgrim brothers purchased the Hudson Cotton Gin and a hatchery in Mt. Pleasant, Texas. They leased their first chicken-processing plant in Mt. Pleasant in 1960.
Tragedy struck in 1966 when Aubrey Pilgrim died of a heart attack, leaving Bo to lead the company he had worked so hard to help establish. As Bo remembers, "I can't begin to tell you what a shock Aubrey's death was to me. My whole world was shaken... Aubrey and I were brothers and business partners. Nobody was closer to me."
After a long, sleepless night, Bo Pilgrim decided it was up to him to continue the Pilgrim's legacy.
"That single decision gave my life direction from that day forward," he said. "I had every hope and intention and motivating desire to run the company to even greater heights. Failure was not an option."
Growth Through Acquisitions
In the years ahead, the company continued to grow and thrive, purchasing Market Produce of Fort Worth in 1969 and undergoing two name changes: Pilgrim's Corporation and Pilgrim Industries, Inc. Several other acquisitions followed, and on November 15, 1986, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation became a publicly owned company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One year later, the company expanded into Mexico.
In the 1990s, Pilgrim's Pride continued its growth, acquiring Green Acre Foods, Inc. in Nacogdoches, Texas. Fast-forward to the acquisition of WLR Foods, Inc., in 2001, which expanded the company's sales and marketing capabilities from coast to coast, and the purchase of ConAgra's chicken division in 2003, which doubled the size of the company and helped generate record sales and earnings growth for Pilgrim's Pride.
On December 27, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride completed the acquisition of Atlanta-based Gold Kist for $1.1 billion in cash and the assumption of approximately $144 million of debt. At the time, Gold Kist had been the third-largest poultry processor in America, processing 14 million birds per week and employing 16,500 people at the time it was acquired by Pilgrim's Pride. With the addition of Gold Kist, Pilgrim's became the world's leading chicken company in terms of production and the fourth-largest U.S. meat protein company by revenues.
But by 2008, the chicken market had changed dramatically. Record-high corn prices, an oversupply of chicken and financial constraints combined to force Pilgrim's Pride to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008. The company brought in a new CEO, Don Jackson, who steered the company through a 13-month reorganization in which it closed plants, eliminated thousands of administrative and production jobs, and refocused on becoming a market-driven company. In December 2009, Pilgrim's emerged from its reorganization as a stronger, more competitive company. Pilgrim's also achieved an incredibly rare feat for companies in Chapter 11 – it repaid all creditors in full and preserved significant value for existing shareholders. JBS USA, a unit of JBS S.A. in Brazil, acquired 64% of Pilgrim's stock in December 2009.
Pilgrim's is now headed by Bill Lovette, our CEO since 2011. The company’s mission has been focused on striving to be the best managed and most respected company in the industry by being a valued partner with our key customers, relentless pursuit of operational excellence, and strategically growing our valued added exports.
On June 1st, 2015, Pilgrim's announced plans to acquire Tyson de México, a poultry company with an estimated annual revenue of $650 million. Tyson and Pilgrim's worked together to complete the deal quickly, and it was finalized June 26, 2015. 
Pilgrim's announced on November 29, 2016 its agreement to acquire GNP Company, a leading provider of premium branded chicken products in the Upper Midwest, in an all cash, $350 million transaction. The transaction, as described in the announcement, was completed on January 6, 2017.
Today JBS USA controls 78.5% of Pilgrim’s stock.

Whole Chicken (100% Natural Ingredients)






t's hard to go wrong with Pilgrim's whole birds and your imagination. In fact, there's almost no limit to the variety of exotic and delightful marinades that will make our chicken a mouth-watering party in your mouth.
A whole chicken is like a blank canvas. Its only limits are how imaginative and creative you want to be. A whole chicken can be combined with any taste that suits your palette or craving and a good marinade, which can be subtle or flamboyant, makes chicken taste like a flavor-explosion in your mouth. Some common marinade ingredients include olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, lemon or lime juice, chili powder, curry, mustard, barbecue sauce, honey, or almost anything else in your spice cabinet, pantry or refrigerator.
For best results, pour the marinade over the whole chicken and chill overnight. The next day, the whole chicken will have absorbed the nuances of every spice and juice in the marinade. With a little cooking you'll have a crowd-pleasing meal in no time.

Split Breast with Ribs (100% Natural Ingredients)







Keep a package of Pilgrim's skinless split breasts around and you'll always be ready to whip up a great meal in no time. This versatile cut of chicken is a great source of protein and it's skinless, so it's extremely low in fat, making you look like a health fanatic (even if you're not). And it's affordable, but also very meaty, so you'll look like you spent a lot (when you didn't). And you can make almost anything with it, so you'll look like a creative genius in the kitchen (which you can be if you check out our recipe database).
Throw these split breasts on the grill with your favorite barbecue sauce; toss them in the oven with some Italian seasoning or onion soup mix and olive oil; throw them in the crock pot with some curry, coriander and ginger; or baste them lightly with butter and basil and slide them into the broiler. You can't help but be a talented cook when you use Pilgrim's chicken.

Drumsticks (100% Natural Ingredients)







It's a shame that a chicken has only two legs, because we know everyone at your table wants one. Drumsticks are so easy to eat, so juicy and delicious, they are the first pieces snatched up and haggled over. That's why we sell an entire package of drumsticks, so you can please every kid and kid-at-heart in your family.
Drumsticks are delicious breaded, fried or baked. A baked drumstick is all about the seasoning and the breading. Favorites include a parmesan crust, or honey, teriyaki, buttermilk or mustard.
Oven-fried chicken is a healthy twist on a classic favorite. The taste and crunch of fried chicken, without the health consequences and calories. To try it, remove the skin and dip the drumsticks in a mixture of non-fat buttermilk before coating it in your favorite spices with whole wheat flour (rather than refined flour) and sunflower seeds for the added crunch. Spray the pieces with low-calorie cooking spray for that sinful (without the sin) fried taste.

Leg Quarters (100% Natural Ingredients)







Pilgrim's leg quarters are one of the most affordable cuts of chicken available. And not only do they give you a hearty meal option to satisfy every member of your family, they're are also positively delicious.
To make a quick lunch or dinner, rub or roll the leg quarters in a mixture of rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper. Then place the chicken in a pan and pour chardonnay in the bottom of the pan. The alcohol in the wine will burn off but it will leave a delectable flavor in the chicken.
Add a little spice to your life with oven-fried cajun leg quarters. Coat the chicken with a mixture of pepper, garlic, Creole seasoning, paprika, cayenne, melted butter and flour. Bake until cooked throughout, although the aroma will leave you wishing it would cook quicker. Let cool and serve for a new family favorite.

Drumsticks (100% Natural Ingredients)







It's a shame that a chicken has only two legs, because we know everyone at your table wants one. Drumsticks are so easy to eat, so juicy and delicious, they are the first pieces snatched up and haggled over. That's why we sell an entire package of drumsticks, so you can please every kid and kid-at-heart in your family.
Drumsticks are delicious breaded, fried or baked. A baked drumstick is all about the seasoning and the breading. Favorites include a parmesan crust, or honey, teriyaki, buttermilk or mustard.
Oven-fried chicken is a healthy twist on a classic favorite. The taste and crunch of fried chicken, without the health consequences and calories. To try it, remove the skin and dip the drumsticks in a mixture of non-fat buttermilk before coating it in your favorite spices with whole wheat flour (rather than refined flour) and sunflower seeds for the added crunch. Spray the pieces with low-calorie cooking spray for that sinful (without the sin) fried taste.

Wingettes: 1st & 2nd Joint Wing Sections (100% Natural Ingredients)







Pilgrim's wingettes are a great foundation for a variety of meals, either exotic or mellow, dependent only on your cravings. For a walk on the exotic side, try sweet and sour chicken wingettes, sticky chicken with your favorite barbecue sauce or Chinese chicken coated with brown sugar and soy sauce. For a more mellow dish, simply flavor the wings with celery and onions.
To cook, put olive oil in the bottom of a skillet, glaze with your favorite seasonings, sauces and veggies, turning until the chicken is tender and cooked through. The smell alone will draw your family to the kitchen asking "what's for dinner?" Wingettes can also be marinated overnight with fennel, cinnamon, garlic, sherry, soy sauce, onions, pepper, or cloves and then baked.

Whole Chicken (All Natural)







A whole chicken is one of the most economical ways to provide your family with a nutritious and delicious meal. And Pilgrim's whole chickens are guaranteed to come out succulent and juicy every time.
What's more, a whole chicken and a crock pot make a perfect marriage for busy parents too tired to labor over a hot stove after a long day. Simply put the chicken, veggies, potatoes, onion, garlic and spices in the crock pot in the morning and turn it on low. When you return from the day's activities, the smell of a hot, comforting meal will delight the whole family and the chicken will be so tender, it will fall off the bone.
To further save time and money, use one whole chicken to make several small meals. You can cook the chicken at the beginning of the week and use the meat in several protein-rich, delicious meals. Menu ideas include chicken salad, chicken spaghetti, chicken noodle soup and chicken dumplings.

                                    Split Breast with Ribs (All Natural)
                                





Split Breast with Ribs (All Natural)







Pilgrim's split breasts are a frugal mom's favorite cut of chicken. Why? It's very affordable, very healthy and there's a lot of meat to work with. One large package of split breasts can make three easy meals at a bargain.
To get the most out of the product, debone the split breasts and pop the bones into a crock pot almost full of water. Add about two tablespoons of vinegar to leach the nutrients like calcium out of the bone and add some garlic and Italian seasoning for flavor. In about eight hours, you can freeze about four cups of broth for future use.
While the broth is simmering, put a couple of breasts in a baggie with some spiced tomatoes for future chicken fajitas. Put a couple of breasts in a baggie with lime juice and honey for future honey lime chicken. And put what's left into a skillet with veggies for a delightful chicken stir-fry. You'll have half a week's worth of meals and broths with one package of chicken. That's a frugal mom's dream.

Wingettes: 1st & 2nd Joint Wing Sections (100% Natural Ingredients)







Pilgrim's wingettes are a great foundation for a variety of meals, either exotic or mellow, dependent only on your cravings. For a walk on the exotic side, try sweet and sour chicken wingettes, sticky chicken with your favorite barbecue sauce or Chinese chicken coated with brown sugar and soy sauce. For a more mellow dish, simply flavor the wings with celery and onions.
To cook, put olive oil in the bottom of a skillet, glaze with your favorite seasonings, sauces and veggies, turning until the chicken is tender and cooked through. The smell alone will draw your family to the kitchen asking "what's for dinner?" Wingettes can also be marinated overnight with fennel, cinnamon, garlic, sherry, soy sauce, onions, pepper, or cloves and then baked.

Whole Chicken (All Natural)







A whole chicken is one of the most economical ways to provide your family with a nutritious and delicious meal. And Pilgrim's whole chickens are guaranteed to come out succulent and juicy every time.
What's more, a whole chicken and a crock pot make a perfect marriage for busy parents too tired to labor over a hot stove after a long day. Simply put the chicken, veggies, potatoes, onion, garlic and spices in the crock pot in the morning and turn it on low. When you return from the day's activities, the smell of a hot, comforting meal will delight the whole family and the chicken will be so tender, it will fall off the bone.
To further save time and money, use one whole chicken to make several small meals. You can cook the chicken at the beginning of the week and use the meat in several protein-rich, delicious meals. Menu ideas include chicken salad, chicken spaghetti, chicken noodle soup and chicken dumplings.

Thighs (All Natural)







Thighs are one of the most versatile and affordable sources of meat protein in the supermarket today. In a pinch, you can make just about any recipe calling for a chicken breast with a thigh to stretch your family's dollar. Pilgrim's natural thigh meat is lean and high in protein, a very important nutrient for your entire family, especially children.
For an interesting new chicken dish, try mixing up some apricot preserves, dry onion soup mix and a cup of French Dressing. Pour it over the thighs in a baking dish and in an hour you'll have a delightful meal to thrill your family's taste buds. The sweetness of the apricot and the savory taste of the onion combine to create a new family favorite.
For something more exotic, combine spicy hot sauce, cumin, lime, cilantro, black beans, olive oil, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, onions, all-spice, garlic and chicken broth with browned thighs in a crock pot. In a couple of hours your tongue will be doing the tango in excitement over this Latin dish.

                                    Drumsticks (All Natural)
                                





Drumsticks (All Natural)







Drumsticks are so easy to eat, so juicy and delicious, they are the first piece of chicken you'll give a toddler because it's easy for them to hold and nibble on. Imagine the delight of a child who has graduated from pureed, unseasoned meat-stuff to a golden, crispy, delicious drumstick. That's a good day in a kid's life and a memorable moment for the family. And it's a simple pleasure that no one ever grows out of, as even adults love a drumstick.
For a healthier than fried drumstick, try our "oven-fried" chicken recipe. It's got the taste and crunch of fried chicken, without the health consequences and calories. To prepare it, remove the skin and dip the drumstick in a mixture of non-fat buttermilk before coating it in your favorite spices with whole wheat flour (rather than refined flour) and sunflower seeds for the added crunch. Spray the pieces with low-calorie cooking spray for that sinful (without the sin) fried taste. Bake and enjoy!
Check out our recipe database for more delicious, family-pleasing ways to cook drumsticks.

Drumsticks (All Natural)







Drumsticks are so easy to eat, so juicy and delicious, they are the first piece of chicken you'll give a toddler because it's easy for them to hold and nibble on. Imagine the delight of a child who has graduated from pureed, unseasoned meat-stuff to a golden, crispy, delicious drumstick. That's a good day in a kid's life and a memorable moment for the family. And it's a simple pleasure that no one ever grows out of, as even adults love a drumstick.
For a healthier than fried drumstick, try our "oven-fried" chicken recipe. It's got the taste and crunch of fried chicken, without the health consequences and calories. To prepare it, remove the skin and dip the drumstick in a mixture of non-fat buttermilk before coating it in your favorite spices with whole wheat flour (rather than refined flour) and sunflower seeds for the added crunch. Spray the pieces with low-calorie cooking spray for that sinful (without the sin) fried taste. Bake and enjoy!
Check out our recipe database for more delicious, family-pleasing ways to cook drumsticks.

Frequently Asked Questions









FAQ

Where can I buy Pilgrim's chicken?

Look for our distinctive chicken logo in the fresh meat case and frozen section.

For commercial foodservice products, visit our Pierce Chicken website, poultry.com.

Are your chickens produced in the United States?

Yes. All of our products come from chicken that are hatched, raised and harvested in the United States. Additionally, we do export our products to other countries outside of the US to be sold within that country. We do have 6 plants in Mexico – the chickens produced in Mexico are only sold in Mexico or exported to other countries. COOL labeling was established in 2002 requiring retailers to notify their customers the country of origin on the label of the Pilgrim’s product.
Check out our FreshTrace page to find out where each package of chicken originated.

What is Pilgrims view on the humane treatment of animals?

Pilgrim’s strongly supports the humane treatment of animals. Our company maintains a strict animal welfare program that utilizes guidelines established by the National Chicken Council. The goal of our program is to avoid unnecessary suffering, prevent destructive behavior, provide proper nutrition and implement health programs through grow out and processing. These guidelines ensure that birds raised are taken care of with the highest standards starting at hatch. Humane treatment is practiced during the processing of the bird as well.

Are your chicken products gluten-free?

Our fresh, non-marinated, products do not contain gluten because they do not contain wheat.  To be labeled or marketed as “Gluten Free”, Pilgrim’s would have to test the product for gluten.   Our prepared food items (such as breaded items) would have any declared allergens listed on the package (e.g. such as wheat).  If the products have been tested and verified as “gluten free”, they will be labeled as such.  

Where can I find recipes for your products?

Please reference the Recipes page on this website. This will offer you multiple delicious recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner that allow you to utilize our products.  This tab will also provide you with cooking and prepping instructions for various Pilgrims Pride products. You can also visit our Pilgrims Pride Facebook page or search for Pilgrims Recipes on Pinterest.  

How long can I keep a fresh product in the refrigerator or freezer? 

We suggest you only keep a fresh product in the refrigerator no longer than 48 hours. Fresh products are good in the freezer for 1 year after the ‘Best By’ date if product is frozen within 48 hours of purchase and temperatures are maintained at least 0° F or below.

How long do I cook my whole chicken?

For best results, bake a whole chicken at 350° F in a conventional oven. Cook chicken for approximately 20 minutes per pound or until internal temperature reaches 165° F. For best quality, bone in chicken (such as whole chicken) should be cooked to an internal temperature of 185 degrees F to set the bone marrow.  Be sure to take the temperature in the thickest part of the meat. Please refer to Safe Cooking recommendations from USDA at www.usda.gov.

Is there GMO in my chicken?

Pilgrim’s flocks are fed a wholesome mixture of grains as well as vitamins and minerals.   Corn and soybean meal are the main ingredients in our feed formulas.  As with most commercially available corn and soybeans in the US, these items are considered genetically modified organism (GMO).  In fact, no significant amount of chicken can be produced with non-GMO corn and soybean meal. In addition, all of these major ingredients are from natural sources and are approved for animal use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

How long can I keep your chicken salad in the fridge or freezer after opening?

In the refrigerator, the chicken salad can be kept for up to 16 weeks unopened from the date of manufacture or for 7 days after being opened. In the freezer, the chicken salad can be kept for 3 months regardless of whether it has been opened or not. Keeping chicken salad in the freezer may change the flavor and consistency. 

Why have the Blazin Wings increased in size?

The specification of this product allows for a range of different sized wings. Like people, chickens vary quite a bit in size and many factors contribute to this. Since Pilgrims uses broiler chickens, they are significantly larger because of the breed. We do carry a product called Blazin Chunks; this is the same product, just smaller, bite-sized boneless breast meat.

What is the pad in the bottom of my tray pack of chicken? 

This pad is called the soaker pad. This soaker pads purpose is to absorb excess moisture from the chicken that weeps after being packaged. The soaker pad and its contents are not for consumption; however, it is deemed safe and not a health safety concern by FDA if accidently consumed or cooked with the chicken.

Why does my chicken weigh less than the package states? 

In October of 2008, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) eliminated the wet tare method used for determining net weight of poultry and meat products purchased by consumers. The wet tare method for determining net weight of poultry and meat products does not include liquids absorbed into packaging materials or free-flowing in the package as part of the net weight of the product. USDA now mandates the use of dry tare procedures. This means that the net weight of the product includes all fluid absorbed into the packaging and any free-flowing fluid in the package. Pilgrim’s plants are in compliance with USDA procedures and product is inspected onsite by USDA staff. Additional information on this policy can be found on the USDA website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/2008-0015.htm.
Additionally, our plants use water during processing to cool the chicken. This will cause some natural pick up of moisture during this process. As chicken ages in the store and nears its expiration date, the product will lose moisture, thus being absorbed by the soaker pad in the packaging. 

Do you have any coupons for your consumers?

Unfortunately, at this moment we do not have a consumer coupon offer. Please continue to check back for the latest offers and promotions. We work with our retailers to provide the best valued prices everyday. 

What is in the feed that is consumed by your chickens?

Our nutritionists develop a wholesome mixture of corn and soybean meal that are used as the main ingredients in our feed formulas. Ingredients for our feed are selected to provide a balanced diet and promote overall animal health.

Are your chickens free range?

Pilgrim’s flocks are raised in large poultry barns that protect them from environmental extremes and migratory birds which can transmit disease. These barns allow for our farmers to regulate their air flow and ensure they are receiving adequate food and water. Though they are not considered free range, which would allow them to roam freely outside, they are given plenty of space to move freely inside of the barn. Many barns are up to 600 feet long which is equivalent to the length of two football fields.

Do you sell halal chicken?

Pilgrim’s offers a selection of Halal certified products. These are generally sent for export outside of the U.S. All of our Halal products have clearly marked labels indicating so. Contact our sales department for availability.
If chicken product is labeled Halal you will see this  Halal USDA bug.  


Do your chickens receive any antibiotics?

We use antibiotics only as instructed by our veterinarians, all of whom are board-certified by the American College of Poultry Veterinarians, to treat or prevent disease. The antibiotics are used in strict accordance with FDA and USDA guidelines, leaving our products free of harmful residue. This is verified on-site by USDA sampling. Some of our birds are raised antibiotic free and those products are clearly labeled as such. If our birds receive any sort of antibiotic treatment, the product would not be qualified or labeled as "antibiotic free".

Do your chickens receive any hormones or steroids?

No. Our chickens do not receive growth hormones or steroids in any way. In fact, the use of hormones has been illegal in poultry since 1952.

Raising Pilgrim's Chickens






In the Hatchery
At Pilgrim's, the chicken comes first, then the eggs. We buy day-old chicks, called pullets, from primary breeder companies and raise them to be breeders. The breeder hens lay eggs that are collected and taken to our hatcheries, where they are incubated and hatched. When the eggs hatch, the chicks are sent to contract grow-out farms to be raised to maturity.
At the Feed Mill
Pilgrim's owns and operates multiple feed mills, which are strategically located in the areas where we have operations.
We manufacture our feed using a proprietary mixture that includes corn, soybean meal and other grains, and we feed our chickens only natural ingredients. We do not use growth hormones of any kind in our poultry rations.
Once the feed has been formulated, pelleted and blended at the feed mill, it's loaded into feed trucks that deliver the finished feed to local growout farms.
On the Farm

We highly value our relationships with our poultry growers, because their success on the farm helps make possible the excellent Pilgrim's poultry products our customers expect and demand.
Pilgrim's contracts with approximately over 4,000 family farmers in the U.S. and Mexico to grow chickens for our operations. We provide the birds, feed, and technical and veterinary services, while growers provide the labor, housing, litter, utilities and, most important, the knowledge and expertise that's essential to maintaining the Pilgrim's standard of excellence.
Inside a Poultry building Pilgrim's technicians work with each farm family, visiting the farm regularly and remaining on call for the farm 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to assure the best possible growout conditions for our flocks.Important to the rural areas where our company has operations, poultry production helps maintain the family farm. Our contract growers are committed to being leaders in environmental stewardship, pledged to maintain and improve the quality of life where they live and work.

Processing and Food Production
Pilgrim's operates various fresh processing plants and prepared foods cook plants in the U.S. Pilgrim's also operates three fresh processing plants in Mexico and one in Puerto Rico.
Every Pilgrim's processing facility in the U.S. is regularly inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to ensure that our food products meet all federal food safety standards.
All of our plants have been certified by the British Retailers Consortium (BRC), one of four audits recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative. These audits, which today are required by most of our retail customers, are used to evaluate a plant's food safety and quality programs. With 326 requirements that must be met before a final certification grade can be given, the audit is among the toughest in the industry. Earning a "clean sweep" of all plants passing this thorough audit for four years in a row is an unprecedented achievement, and we are extremely proud of each of our plants for their dedication and commitment to food safety and quality standards.

OUR HISTORY
The story began on October 2, 1946, when Aubrey Pilgrim and his partner, Pat Johns, purchased a feed and seed store for $3,500 from W. W. Weems in Pittsburg, Texas. Soon after forming the partnership, Aubrey asked his brother, Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim, to join them.
The Early Days
In the early days, the Pilgrims would sell 100 baby chicks and a sack of feed to local farmers who would take the chicks home and raise them in their back yards, keeping some for family needs and bringing back the remainder when they were grown. Selling baby chicks to drive feed sales was one of several innovative ideas that would later lead to the "vertical integration" model of poultry production used by nearly every major poultry company today.
Overcoming Obstacles
The Pilgrim brothers faced a number of tremendous challenges in building their new business.
"There was nothing remotely close to a long-range plan, a strategic plan, or a business plan associated with Farmer's Feed and Seed," Bo recalled. "I doubt if there was even very much time for daydreaming about a future. We were working long hours, sometimes hauling a load of peas over to the Cass County Canning Co. in Atlanta, Texas, not getting home until three o'clock in the morning, then getting to the store to open it at seven o'clock. The fact is, it was all about survival. Survival meant meeting a customer's expectations so the customer would become a return customer."
He soon learned not only to survive, but also how make a business grow.
"The first year I was with my brother as a partner, we added a warehouse to the store and, with it, a loading ramp, unloading pit, an elevator to carry feed to a bagging machine, and an electric sewing machine for the feed sacks," he said.
Bo's early process improvements allowed the company to dramatically reduce wasted grain, which used to be lost through the cracks of the floor in the feed store, and enabled the Pilgrim brothers to use automation to sell truckloads of feed out of the warehouse.
"We began to grow in a way that, looking back, was a set of small but integrated steps. We didn't know it at the time, of course, that our steps were linked in some way. We were simply responding to one opportunity after the next. In retrospect, the pieces of a fairly elaborate puzzle were beginning to fall into place," said Bo.
       
The puzzle soon began to take shape as opportunities came in the form of acquisitions and capital improvements. The first major expansion came in the 1950s, when the Pilgrim brothers purchased the Hudson Cotton Gin and a hatchery in Mt. Pleasant, Texas. They leased their first chicken-processing plant in Mt. Pleasant in 1960.
Tragedy struck in 1966 when Aubrey Pilgrim died of a heart attack, leaving Bo to lead the company he had worked so hard to help establish. As Bo remembers, "I can't begin to tell you what a shock Aubrey's death was to me. My whole world was shaken... Aubrey and I were brothers and business partners. Nobody was closer to me."
After a long, sleepless night, Bo Pilgrim decided it was up to him to continue the Pilgrim's legacy.
"That single decision gave my life direction from that day forward," he said. "I had every hope and intention and motivating desire to run the company to even greater heights. Failure was not an option."
Growth Through Acquisitions
In the years ahead, the company continued to grow and thrive, purchasing Market Produce of Fort Worth in 1969 and undergoing two name changes: Pilgrim's Corporation and Pilgrim Industries, Inc. Several other acquisitions followed, and on November 15, 1986, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation became a publicly owned company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One year later, the company expanded into Mexico.
In the 1990s, Pilgrim's Pride continued its growth, acquiring Green Acre Foods, Inc. in Nacogdoches, Texas. Fast-forward to the acquisition of WLR Foods, Inc., in 2001, which expanded the company's sales and marketing capabilities from coast to coast, and the purchase of ConAgra's chicken division in 2003, which doubled the size of the company and helped generate record sales and earnings growth for Pilgrim's Pride.
On December 27, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride completed the acquisition of Atlanta-based Gold Kist for $1.1 billion in cash and the assumption of approximately $144 million of debt. At the time, Gold Kist had been the third-largest poultry processor in America, processing 14 million birds per week and employing 16,500 people at the time it was acquired by Pilgrim's Pride. With the addition of Gold Kist, Pilgrim's became the world's leading chicken company in terms of production and the fourth-largest U.S. meat protein company by revenues.
But by 2008, the chicken market had changed dramatically. Record-high corn prices, an oversupply of chicken and financial constraints combined to force Pilgrim's Pride to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008. The company brought in a new CEO, Don Jackson, who steered the company through a 13-month reorganization in which it closed plants, eliminated thousands of administrative and production jobs, and refocused on becoming a market-driven company. In December 2009, Pilgrim's emerged from its reorganization as a stronger, more competitive company. Pilgrim's also achieved an incredibly rare feat for companies in Chapter 11 – it repaid all creditors in full and preserved significant value for existing shareholders. JBS USA, a unit of JBS S.A. in Brazil, acquired 64% of Pilgrim's stock in December 2009.
Pilgrim's is now headed by Bill Lovette, our CEO since 2011. The company’s mission has been focused on striving to be the best managed and most respected company in the industry by being a valued partner with our key customers, relentless pursuit of operational excellence, and strategically growing our valued added exports.
On June 1st, 2015, Pilgrim's announced plans to acquire Tyson de México, a poultry company with an estimated annual revenue of $650 million. Tyson and Pilgrim's worked together to complete the deal quickly, and it was finalized June 26, 2015. 
Pilgrim's announced on November 29, 2016 its agreement to acquire GNP Company, a leading provider of premium branded chicken products in the Upper Midwest, in an all cash, $350 million transaction. The transaction, as described in the announcement, was completed on January 6, 2017.
Today JBS USA controls 78.5% of Pilgrim’s stock.

Bo Pilgrim, a small-town Texan who transformed a tiny feed and seed store into one of the biggest chicken producers in the United States and put himself in its logo — in the form of a silhouetted profile under a black, buckled Pilgrim’s hat — died on Friday at his home in Pittsburg, Tex. He was 89.The Erman Smith Funeral Home in Pittsburg announced his death on its website.Mr. Pilgrim — he was born Lonnie but everyone knew him as Bo — founded the Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, which, though best known in the Southeast, achieved a national reputation for high-quality chicken, turkey and egg products.At its peak, the company had operations in 17 states and Mexico, more than 35,000 employees and thousands of trucks. Mr. Pilgrim was its face and voice, offering a dry wit in television and radio commercials.But he also oversaw the company through difficult times involving a bankruptcy, a product recall over bacterial infections, animal-cruelty allegations and an ethics scandal in which Mr. Pilgrim handed out $10,000 checks to lawmakers on the floor of the Texas Senate.

Pilgrim’s Pride won industry renown as an innovator.

The recipe was subsequently entered in The Congressional Record. Continue reading the main story

Another innovation was the boneless whole chicken. Mr. Pilgrim himself labored for months to perfect a method of removing all the bones from the carcass with no incisions other than those originally used in processing.“People seemed fascinated with the concept,” Mr. Pilgrim recalled.The boneless whole chicken won the company national and even international attention. Numerous publications, including Good Housekeeping, interviewed him.But the product ultimately failed to catch on with consumers, and it was discontinued, though not without a promotion campaign that was recognized with an award by the Texas Public Relations Association.Pilgrim’s Pride was rooted in Pittsburg, about 130 miles east of Dallas, and the company remains there, one of the area’s largest employers. The plant features a roadside attraction — a kind of shrine to Mr. Pilgrim that the locals call the Hat, a 37-foot-tall painted bust of the man himself, looking every bit the glasses-wearing, gray-haired executive he was — in a suit jacket, white shirt and tie — except for the Pilgrim’s hat atop his head.Below the bust is another sculpture, a life-size depiction of a younger Mr. Pilgrim, sitting on a bench reading the Bible alongside a favorite chicken named Henrietta.Lonnie Pilgrim was born on May 8, 1928 — named in honor of his father, Alonzo, he said — in Pine, Tex., a town of 80 to 100 people at the time. The fourth of seven children (two others died in infancy), he was called Bo by relatives from an early age. His father owned one of two stores in the town, called the Pine Grocery and Post Office.When his father died of a heart attack in 1939, his mother, Gertrude, took over the store and ran it for the next 20 years.

“A few Sundays after my father died,” Mr. Pilgrim wrote in his memoir, “I made a personal commitment of my life to Jesus Christ. I knew that I needed to do that if I was going to be with my father in heaven someday.”When his mother remarried soon afterward, Bo, then 13, felt betrayed and left home to live with his paternal grandmother and aunt on a farm with no running water or electricity.It was his older brother, Aubrey, and a partner who bought the feed store in Pittsburg, and when the partner sold out, Aubrey invited Bo to join him. The store added a warehouse, from which they could sell truckloads of feed.

“All we had in the beginning were a two-wheel buggy, a shovel, some burlap sacks and Bo’s big ideas,” a longtime associate recalled in Mr. Pilgrim’s memoir, “One Pilgrim’s Progress: How to Build a World-Class Company and Who to Credit,” published in 2005.The subtitle alluded to Mr. Pilgrim’s robust Baptist faith, which he later exhibited in his everyday business and personal interactions and imparted as a Sunday school teacher for a half-century. Classes were often held in the boardroom of the community bank he had bought several decades earlier and renamed the Pilgrim Bank. He was its chairman emeritus at his death.Drafted into the Army, Mr. Pilgrim was sent to California, where he saw huge feed operations that inspired him on his return to Texas to push the company to invest in larger facilities and expand into processed and prepared chicken products. Pilgrim also became a major egg producer.

But in 1966, Aubrey Pilgrim died of a heart attack at 42, and, aware of his family’s history of heart ailments, Bo Pilgrim began a campaign to live healthier. The company developed what it called the first lean chicken, with less fat and cholesterol and without artificial color. Pilgrim’s Pride later marketed nutritionally enhanced eggs.It was in the 1980s that the company began advertising in earnest. “I was the logical spokesperson,” Mr. Pilgrim wrote.“I put on a business suit and then donned a black buckled Pilgrim hat on my white hair,” he added. “With a name like Pilgrim, what could be more logical.” His tagline was “Nobody likes a fat chicken.”

Fearing bankruptcy, Pilgrim agreed to sell out to Tyson Foods, the world’s largest poultry concern, but Tyson backed out of the deal and Pilgrim recovered.Pilgrim doubled in size with the acquisition of ConAgra’s poultry division but subsequently experienced a host of setbacks, including a huge product recall involving an outbreak of listeriosis, a damaging episode of avian flu, environmental violations, charges of cruelty to chickens and raids involving immigrant workers.Pilgrim was forced into bankruptcy in 2008 but emerged the following year after repaying creditors and salvaging some value for stockholders.Mr. Pilgrim retired in 2010, and the company is now controlled by a unit of JBS, a Brazilian multinational.Mr. Pilgrim, whose net worth reached $1 billion, and his wife of 61 years, the former Patricia Redding, lived in what they called Chateau de Pilgrim, a French Baroque mansion south of Pittsburg, often called “Bo’s town.” Local residents referred to the house as Cluckingham Palace.His explanation for this concession to grandeur? “The Louis XV period of style,” he wrote, “was noted for very well-mannered dignity, symmetry and functional practicality,” features that appealed to his sense of order.He is survived by his wife; his sons Ken and Patrick; his daughter, Greta Henson; a sister, Sue Hester Kellam; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, also known as Pilgrim's, is a Brazilian-owned, American food company, currently the largest chicken producer in the United States and Puerto Rico and the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. It exited bankruptcy in December 2009 and relocated its U.S. headquarters to Greeley, Colorado, in 2011.[2] It is majority-owned by JBS S.A.. Pilgrim Pride purchased Gold N'Plump for $350 million in late November 2016.

Description of firm[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride distribution center, off of HWY 271 Mt. Pleasant, Texas


Pilgrim's employs about 38,000 people with sales of $8.1 billion in 2012, and has operations in 12 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico. They have the capacity to process about 36 million birds per week resulting in almost 9.5 billion pounds of live chicken annually. [1]
Pilgrim's Pride products are distributed primarily through foodservice and retail outlets.
Pilgrim's traces its origins to a feed store opened in 1946 in Pittsburg, Texas, by Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim and his older brother, Aubrey. The brothers were known to give away free chicks with the bags of feed they sold, thereby expanding their business. Bo Pilgrim, wearing traditional Pilgrim dress, with a pet chicken named "Henrietta" under his arm, was featured in Pilgrim's Pride advertisements. Today, Pilgrim's Pride is vertically integrated, meaning the company has its own divisions for every process from "egg to table."
Pilgrim's Pride is a supplier of Kentucky Fried Chicken and was named its "supplier of the year" in 1997. Other customers include Wal-Mart, Publix, and Wendy's.
News events in the 2000s[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride logo used until 2011.


On October 12, 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry after finding a strain of Listeria monocytogenes in the drain of one of their facilities. It was the largest food recall in the US at the time. The outbreak killed 7 people, sickened 46, and caused 3 miscarriages. [2] [3] [3]
In 2003, Pilgrim's Pride acquired Pierce Chicken (formerly of ConAgra Foods and Hester Industries). Pierce Chicken is best known for its brand-name Wing Dings, Wing Zings, and various other prepared food products.[4]
In May 2004, Pilgrim's Pride experienced an outbreak of avian influenza in Hopkins County in northeast Texas; 24,000 breeder hens were destroyed to contain the outbreak. [4]
On July 20, 2004, PETA released a video showing cruelty to chickens at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in West Virginia.[5] The video showed Pilgrim Pride employees kicking, jumping, throwing, and spitting on live chickens.[6] Pilgrim's Pride held an investigation, fired 11 employees, including managers, and has provided ongoing animal welfare training to its work force after KFC owner Yum Brands threatened to cease purchasing from the company following the incident; none of the employees faced any criminal charges.
Pilgrim's is also a supplier of cattle feed to various ranching operations in East Texas. The supply of cattle feed was criticized because of the alleged use of "inedible" chicken parts being used for protein content. This is a common practice in the poultry industry known as protein conversion, so as to profit from all parts of the bird. Protein conversion uses techniques to convert inedible parts of the animal, such as keratin in feathers and skin, into digestible protein to be used for livestock and pet food.
On December 4, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride announced the successful acquisition [5] of Gold Kist (formerly the third largest chicken company) for $21.00 a share. Although there was initial resistance from Gold Kist, the board members of both companies voted unanimously to combine the two companies.
On December 17, 2007, Pilgrim's Pride's CEO, O.B. Goolsby, Jr. died after suffering a stroke while on a hunting trip in South Texas with customers.[7]
On April 16, 2008, after a yearlong investigation US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided plants in Batesville, Arkansas, Live Oak, Florida, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mount Pleasant, Texas, and Moorefield, West Virginia. Officials arrested 311 foreign national employees on suspicion of identity theft. Of these, 91 have been formally charged.[8]




The Pilgrim's Pride feed mill in Pittsburg, Texas, in August 2015


On 27 May 2014, the company announced a $6.4 billion cash and debt offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands. A rival bid from Tyson Foods followed two days later. On June 9, 2014, the company announced it was withdrawing its bid for Hillshire after Tyson Foods had increased its offer to $8.55 billion.[9]
Purchased by JBS S.A.[edit]
On September 17, 2009, JBS USA Holdings, Inc. announced the purchase of 64% of the shares of Pilgrim's Pride. JBS USA Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Brazilian multinational JBS S.A., the largest meat processor in the world, and the largest by revenue. Currently JBS USA Holdings, Inc. owns 75.3% of the company.
As a result, Pilgrim's Pride closed its corporate offices in Texas and Georgia and moved its headquarters to Greeley, Colorado.[10] This move caused the former headquarters in Pittsburg, Texas, and a location in nearby Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to cut employment by a total of 160 people. Other locations which lost jobs included sites in Atlanta, Dallas, and Broadway, Virginia.[11] [12]

Description of firm[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride distribution center, off of HWY 271 Mt. Pleasant, Texas


Pilgrim's employs about 38,000 people with sales of $8.1 billion in 2012, and has operations in 12 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico. They have the capacity to process about 36 million birds per week resulting in almost 9.5 billion pounds of live chicken annually. [1]
Pilgrim's Pride products are distributed primarily through foodservice and retail outlets.
Pilgrim's traces its origins to a feed store opened in 1946 in Pittsburg, Texas, by Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim and his older brother, Aubrey. The brothers were known to give away free chicks with the bags of feed they sold, thereby expanding their business. Bo Pilgrim, wearing traditional Pilgrim dress, with a pet chicken named "Henrietta" under his arm, was featured in Pilgrim's Pride advertisements. Today, Pilgrim's Pride is vertically integrated, meaning the company has its own divisions for every process from "egg to table."
Pilgrim's Pride is a supplier of Kentucky Fried Chicken and was named its "supplier of the year" in 1997. Other customers include Wal-Mart, Publix, and Wendy's.
News events in the 2000s[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride logo used until 2011.


On October 12, 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry after finding a strain of Listeria monocytogenes in the drain of one of their facilities. It was the largest food recall in the US at the time. The outbreak killed 7 people, sickened 46, and caused 3 miscarriages. [2] [3] [3]
In 2003, Pilgrim's Pride acquired Pierce Chicken (formerly of ConAgra Foods and Hester Industries). Pierce Chicken is best known for its brand-name Wing Dings, Wing Zings, and various other prepared food products.[4]
In May 2004, Pilgrim's Pride experienced an outbreak of avian influenza in Hopkins County in northeast Texas; 24,000 breeder hens were destroyed to contain the outbreak. [4]
On July 20, 2004, PETA released a video showing cruelty to chickens at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in West Virginia.[5] The video showed Pilgrim Pride employees kicking, jumping, throwing, and spitting on live chickens.[6] Pilgrim's Pride held an investigation, fired 11 employees, including managers, and has provided ongoing animal welfare training to its work force after KFC owner Yum Brands threatened to cease purchasing from the company following the incident; none of the employees faced any criminal charges.
Pilgrim's is also a supplier of cattle feed to various ranching operations in East Texas. The supply of cattle feed was criticized because of the alleged use of "inedible" chicken parts being used for protein content. This is a common practice in the poultry industry known as protein conversion, so as to profit from all parts of the bird. Protein conversion uses techniques to convert inedible parts of the animal, such as keratin in feathers and skin, into digestible protein to be used for livestock and pet food.
On December 4, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride announced the successful acquisition [5] of Gold Kist (formerly the third largest chicken company) for $21.00 a share. Although there was initial resistance from Gold Kist, the board members of both companies voted unanimously to combine the two companies.
On December 17, 2007, Pilgrim's Pride's CEO, O.B. Goolsby, Jr. died after suffering a stroke while on a hunting trip in South Texas with customers.[7]
On April 16, 2008, after a yearlong investigation US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided plants in Batesville, Arkansas, Live Oak, Florida, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mount Pleasant, Texas, and Moorefield, West Virginia. Officials arrested 311 foreign national employees on suspicion of identity theft. Of these, 91 have been formally charged.[8]

On 27 May 2014, the company announced a $6.4 billion cash and debt offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands. A rival bid from Tyson Foods followed two days later. On June 9, 2014, the company announced it was withdrawing its bid for Hillshire after Tyson Foods had increased its offer to $8.55 billion.[9]
Purchased by JBS S.A.[edit]
On September 17, 2009, JBS USA Holdings, Inc. announced the purchase of 64% of the shares of Pilgrim's Pride. JBS USA Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Brazilian multinational JBS S.A., the largest meat processor in the world, and the largest by revenue. Currently JBS USA Holdings, Inc. owns 75.3% of the company.
As a result, Pilgrim's Pride closed its corporate offices in Texas and Georgia and moved its headquarters to Greeley, Colorado.[10] This move caused the former headquarters in Pittsburg, Texas, and a location in nearby Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to cut employment by a total of 160 people. Other locations which lost jobs included sites in Atlanta, Dallas, and Broadway, Virginia.[11] [12]

On April 7, 2016, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp recalled approximately 40,780 pounds of fully cooked chicken nuggets produced on Oct. 5, 2015. The following product is subject to recall:

20-lb. cardboard boxes containing two, 10-lb. clear plastic bags of fully cooked chicken nuggets labeled as “GOLD KIST FARMS Fully Cooked Whole Grain Popcorn Style Chicken Patty Fritters” with package codes 5278105021, 5278105022, 5278105023, 5278105000, and 5278105001.

The products subject to recall bears establishment number “EST. 20728” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped for institutional use nationwide. According to Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. records, schools have purchased products through the company’s commercial channels.
The problem was first discovered after the firm received several consumer complaints regarding plastic contamination of the chicken nuggets. The firm notified FSIS personnel of the issue on April 6, 2016. FSIS personnel identified more affected product types and dates of production after investigating additional consumer complaints of foreign material contamination received by the recalling firm.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
Consumers who have purchased the recalled products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

 Retail Distribution Lists
FSIS has reason to believe that the retail locations listed received the recalled meat or poultry products described in the news release.
Lists may not include all retail locations that have received the recalled product or may include retail locations that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information in the news release, in addition to this list of retail stores, to check meat or poultry products in your possession to see if they have been recalled.
For large volume recalls, it may take several days to assemble the initial list. Lists may be updated as additional information becomes available.
"No retail sales" indicates that no retailers were identified for the recall in question. For example, the product may have gone exclusively to restaurants and institutions, and in this case there would be no retailers in the distribution chain.
Finally, FSIS will provide lists when retail sales are associated with a Class I recall. There will be no distribution lists associated with Class II or Class III recalls.

Bo Pilgrim, a small-town Texan who transformed a tiny feed and seed store into one of the biggest chicken producers in the United States and put himself in its logo — in the form of a silhouetted profile under a black, buckled Pilgrim’s hat — died on Friday at his home in Pittsburg, Tex. He was 89.The Erman Smith Funeral Home in Pittsburg announced his death on its website.Mr. Pilgrim — he was born Lonnie but everyone knew him as Bo — founded the Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, which, though best known in the Southeast, achieved a national reputation for high-quality chicken, turkey and egg products.At its peak, the company had operations in 17 states and Mexico, more than 35,000 employees and thousands of trucks. Mr. Pilgrim was its face and voice, offering a dry wit in television and radio commercials.But he also oversaw the company through difficult times involving a bankruptcy, a product recall over bacterial infections, animal-cruelty allegations and an ethics scandal in which Mr. Pilgrim handed out $10,000 checks to lawmakers on the floor of the Texas Senate.

Pilgrim’s Pride won industry renown as an innovator. The hard-core Chili Appreciation Society International thought so much of the company’s chicken chili that it awarded it third prize in an against-the-odds cook-off against the predominant variety, beef. The recipe was subsequently entered in The Congressional Record. Continue reading the main story

Another innovation was the boneless whole chicken. Mr. Pilgrim himself labored for months to perfect a method of removing all the bones from the carcass with no incisions other than those originally used in processing.“People seemed fascinated with the concept,” Mr. Pilgrim recalled.The boneless whole chicken won the company national and even international attention. Numerous publications, including Good Housekeeping, interviewed him.But the product ultimately failed to catch on with consumers, and it was discontinued, though not without a promotion campaign that was recognized with an award by the Texas Public Relations Association.Pilgrim’s Pride was rooted in Pittsburg, about 130 miles east of Dallas, and the company remains there, one of the area’s largest employers. The plant features a roadside attraction — a kind of shrine to Mr. Pilgrim that the locals call the Hat, a 37-foot-tall painted bust of the man himself, looking every bit the glasses-wearing, gray-haired executive he was — in a suit jacket, white shirt and tie — except for the Pilgrim’s hat atop his head.Below the bust is another sculpture, a life-size depiction of a younger Mr. Pilgrim, sitting on a bench reading the Bible alongside a favorite chicken named Henrietta.Lonnie Pilgrim was born on May 8, 1928 — named in honor of his father, Alonzo, he said — in Pine, Tex., a town of 80 to 100 people at the time. The fourth of seven children (two others died in infancy), he was called Bo by relatives from an early age. His father owned one of two stores in the town, called the Pine Grocery and Post Office.When his father died of a heart attack in 1939, his mother, Gertrude, took over the store and ran it for the next 20 years.

“A few Sundays after my father died,” Mr. Pilgrim wrote in his memoir, “I made a personal commitment of my life to Jesus Christ. I knew that I needed to do that if I was going to be with my father in heaven someday.”When his mother remarried soon afterward, Bo, then 13, felt betrayed and left home to live with his paternal grandmother and aunt on a farm with no running water or electricity.It was his older brother, Aubrey, and a partner who bought the feed store in Pittsburg, and when the partner sold out, Aubrey invited Bo to join him. The store added a warehouse, from which they could sell truckloads of feed.

“All we had in the beginning were a two-wheel buggy, a shovel, some burlap sacks and Bo’s big ideas,” a longtime associate recalled in Mr. Pilgrim’s memoir, “One Pilgrim’s Progress: How to Build a World-Class Company and Who to Credit,” published in 2005.The subtitle alluded to Mr. Pilgrim’s robust Baptist faith, which he later exhibited in his everyday business and personal interactions and imparted as a Sunday school teacher for a half-century. Classes were often held in the boardroom of the community bank he had bought several decades earlier and renamed the Pilgrim Bank. He was its chairman emeritus at his death.Drafted into the Army, Mr. Pilgrim was sent to California, where he saw huge feed operations that inspired him on his return to Texas to push the company to invest in larger facilities and expand into processed and prepared chicken products. Pilgrim also became a major egg producer.

But in 1966, Aubrey Pilgrim died of a heart attack at 42, and, aware of his family’s history of heart ailments, Bo Pilgrim began a campaign to live healthier. The company developed what it called the first lean chicken, with less fat and cholesterol and without artificial color. Pilgrim’s Pride later marketed nutritionally enhanced eggs.It was in the 1980s that the company began advertising in earnest. “I was the logical spokesperson,” Mr. Pilgrim wrote.“I put on a business suit and then donned a black buckled Pilgrim hat on my white hair,” he added. “With a name like Pilgrim, what could be more logical.” His tagline was “Nobody likes a fat chicken.”

The company thrived, surviving a highly publicized gaffe when, in 1989, in an effort to support a bill weakening workers’ compensation laws, Mr. Pilgrim handed out $10,000 political contribution checks to eight Texas state senators two days before a scheduled vote. The episode led to changes in the ethics law.(He admitted to “a bonehead mistake” but then reveled in the publicity by accepting an award as bonehead of the year from the Bonehead Club of Dallas.)Pilgrim also survived a late 1980s business downturn in which the company was losing $1 million a week, a result of sharply rising feed costs and a glutted chicken market. Fearing bankruptcy, Pilgrim agreed to sell out to Tyson Foods, the world’s largest poultry concern, but Tyson backed out of the deal and Pilgrim recovered.Pilgrim doubled in size with the acquisition of ConAgra’s poultry division but subsequently experienced a host of setbacks, including a huge product recall involving an outbreak of listeriosis, a damaging episode of avian flu, environmental violations, charges of cruelty to chickens and raids involving immigrant workers.Pilgrim was forced into bankruptcy in 2008 but emerged the following year after repaying creditors and salvaging some value for stockholders.Mr. Pilgrim retired in 2010, and the company is now controlled by a unit of JBS, a Brazilian multinational.Mr. Pilgrim, whose net worth reached $1 billion, and his wife of 61 years, the former Patricia Redding, lived in what they called Chateau de Pilgrim, a French Baroque mansion south of Pittsburg, often called “Bo’s town.” Local residents referred to the house as Cluckingham Palace.His explanation for this concession to grandeur? “The Louis XV period of style,” he wrote, “was noted for very well-mannered dignity, symmetry and functional practicality,” features that appealed to his sense of order.He is survived by his wife; his sons Ken and Patrick; his daughter, Greta Henson; a sister, Sue Hester Kellam; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

Not surprisingly, Mr. Pilgrim, who said he ate chicken every day and routinely carried a stuffed one named Henrietta under his arm, was often asked which came first, the chicken or the egg. His answer, citing “every winged fowl” in the Genesis creation account: “The chicken.”

Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, also known as Pilgrim's, is a Brazilian-owned, American food company, currently the largest chicken producer in the United States and Puerto Rico and the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. It exited bankruptcy in December 2009 and relocated its U.S. headquarters to Greeley, Colorado, in 2011.[2] It is majority-owned by JBS S.A.. Pilgrim Pride purchased Gold N'Plump for $350 million in late November 2016.

Description of firm[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride distribution center, off of HWY 271 Mt. Pleasant, Texas


Pilgrim's employs about 38,000 people with sales of $8.1 billion in 2012, and has operations in 12 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico. They have the capacity to process about 36 million birds per week resulting in almost 9.5 billion pounds of live chicken annually. [1]
Pilgrim's Pride products are distributed primarily through foodservice and retail outlets.
Pilgrim's traces its origins to a feed store opened in 1946 in Pittsburg, Texas, by Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim and his older brother, Aubrey. The brothers were known to give away free chicks with the bags of feed they sold, thereby expanding their business. Bo Pilgrim, wearing traditional Pilgrim dress, with a pet chicken named "Henrietta" under his arm, was featured in Pilgrim's Pride advertisements. Today, Pilgrim's Pride is vertically integrated, meaning the company has its own divisions for every process from "egg to table."
Pilgrim's Pride is a supplier of Kentucky Fried Chicken and was named its "supplier of the year" in 1997. Other customers include Wal-Mart, Publix, and Wendy's.
News events in the 2000s[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride logo used until 2011.


On October 12, 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry after finding a strain of Listeria monocytogenes in the drain of one of their facilities. It was the largest food recall in the US at the time. The outbreak killed 7 people, sickened 46, and caused 3 miscarriages. [2] [3] [3]
In 2003, Pilgrim's Pride acquired Pierce Chicken (formerly of ConAgra Foods and Hester Industries). Pierce Chicken is best known for its brand-name Wing Dings, Wing Zings, and various other prepared food products.[4]
In May 2004, Pilgrim's Pride experienced an outbreak of avian influenza in Hopkins County in northeast Texas; 24,000 breeder hens were destroyed to contain the outbreak. [4]
On July 20, 2004, PETA released a video showing cruelty to chickens at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in West Virginia.[5] The video showed Pilgrim Pride employees kicking, jumping, throwing, and spitting on live chickens.[6] Pilgrim's Pride held an investigation, fired 11 employees, including managers, and has provided ongoing animal welfare training to its work force after KFC owner Yum Brands threatened to cease purchasing from the company following the incident; none of the employees faced any criminal charges.
Pilgrim's is also a supplier of cattle feed to various ranching operations in East Texas. The supply of cattle feed was criticized because of the alleged use of "inedible" chicken parts being used for protein content. This is a common practice in the poultry industry known as protein conversion, so as to profit from all parts of the bird. Protein conversion uses techniques to convert inedible parts of the animal, such as keratin in feathers and skin, into digestible protein to be used for livestock and pet food.
On December 4, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride announced the successful acquisition [5] of Gold Kist (formerly the third largest chicken company) for $21.00 a share. Although there was initial resistance from Gold Kist, the board members of both companies voted unanimously to combine the two companies.
On December 17, 2007, Pilgrim's Pride's CEO, O.B. Goolsby, Jr. died after suffering a stroke while on a hunting trip in South Texas with customers.[7]
On April 16, 2008, after a yearlong investigation US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided plants in Batesville, Arkansas, Live Oak, Florida, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mount Pleasant, Texas, and Moorefield, West Virginia. Officials arrested 311 foreign national employees on suspicion of identity theft. Of these, 91 have been formally charged.[8]




The Pilgrim's Pride feed mill in Pittsburg, Texas, in August 2015


On 27 May 2014, the company announced a $6.4 billion cash and debt offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands. A rival bid from Tyson Foods followed two days later. On June 9, 2014, the company announced it was withdrawing its bid for Hillshire after Tyson Foods had increased its offer to $8.55 billion.[9]
Purchased by JBS S.A.[edit]
On September 17, 2009, JBS USA Holdings, Inc. announced the purchase of 64% of the shares of Pilgrim's Pride. JBS USA Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Brazilian multinational JBS S.A., the largest meat processor in the world, and the largest by revenue. Currently JBS USA Holdings, Inc. owns 75.3% of the company.
As a result, Pilgrim's Pride closed its corporate offices in Texas and Georgia and moved its headquarters to Greeley, Colorado.[10] This move caused the former headquarters in Pittsburg, Texas, and a location in nearby Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to cut employment by a total of 160 people. Other locations which lost jobs included sites in Atlanta, Dallas, and Broadway, Virginia.[11] [12]

Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, also known as Pilgrim's, is a Brazilian-owned, American food company, currently the largest chicken producer in the United States and Puerto Rico and the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. It exited bankruptcy in December 2009 and relocated its U.S. headquarters to Greeley, Colorado, in 2011.[2] It is majority-owned by JBS S.A.. Pilgrim Pride purchased Gold N'Plump for $350 million in late November 2016.

Description of firm[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride distribution center, off of HWY 271 Mt. Pleasant, Texas


Pilgrim's employs about 38,000 people with sales of $8.1 billion in 2012, and has operations in 12 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico. They have the capacity to process about 36 million birds per week resulting in almost 9.5 billion pounds of live chicken annually. [1]
Pilgrim's Pride products are distributed primarily through foodservice and retail outlets.
Pilgrim's traces its origins to a feed store opened in 1946 in Pittsburg, Texas, by Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim and his older brother, Aubrey. The brothers were known to give away free chicks with the bags of feed they sold, thereby expanding their business. Bo Pilgrim, wearing traditional Pilgrim dress, with a pet chicken named "Henrietta" under his arm, was featured in Pilgrim's Pride advertisements. Today, Pilgrim's Pride is vertically integrated, meaning the company has its own divisions for every process from "egg to table."
Pilgrim's Pride is a supplier of Kentucky Fried Chicken and was named its "supplier of the year" in 1997. Other customers include Wal-Mart, Publix, and Wendy's.
News events in the 2000s[edit]




Pilgrim's Pride logo used until 2011.


On October 12, 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry after finding a strain of Listeria monocytogenes in the drain of one of their facilities. It was the largest food recall in the US at the time. The outbreak killed 7 people, sickened 46, and caused 3 miscarriages. [2] [3] [3]
In 2003, Pilgrim's Pride acquired Pierce Chicken (formerly of ConAgra Foods and Hester Industries). Pierce Chicken is best known for its brand-name Wing Dings, Wing Zings, and various other prepared food products.[4]
In May 2004, Pilgrim's Pride experienced an outbreak of avian influenza in Hopkins County in northeast Texas; 24,000 breeder hens were destroyed to contain the outbreak. [4]
On July 20, 2004, PETA released a video showing cruelty to chickens at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in West Virginia.[5] The video showed Pilgrim Pride employees kicking, jumping, throwing, and spitting on live chickens.[6] Pilgrim's Pride held an investigation, fired 11 employees, including managers, and has provided ongoing animal welfare training to its work force after KFC owner Yum Brands threatened to cease purchasing from the company following the incident; none of the employees faced any criminal charges.
Pilgrim's is also a supplier of cattle feed to various ranching operations in East Texas. The supply of cattle feed was criticized because of the alleged use of "inedible" chicken parts being used for protein content. This is a common practice in the poultry industry known as protein conversion, so as to profit from all parts of the bird. Protein conversion uses techniques to convert inedible parts of the animal, such as keratin in feathers and skin, into digestible protein to be used for livestock and pet food.
On December 4, 2006, Pilgrim's Pride announced the successful acquisition [5] of Gold Kist (formerly the third largest chicken company) for $21.00 a share. Although there was initial resistance from Gold Kist, the board members of both companies voted unanimously to combine the two companies.
On December 17, 2007, Pilgrim's Pride's CEO, O.B. Goolsby, Jr. died after suffering a stroke while on a hunting trip in South Texas with customers.[7]
On April 16, 2008, after a yearlong investigation US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided plants in Batesville, Arkansas, Live Oak, Florida, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mount Pleasant, Texas, and Moorefield, West Virginia. Officials arrested 311 foreign national employees on suspicion of identity theft. Of these, 91 have been formally charged.[8]




The Pilgrim's Pride feed mill in Pittsburg, Texas, in August 2015


On 27 May 2014, the company announced a $6.4 billion cash and debt offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands. A rival bid from Tyson Foods followed two days later. On June 9, 2014, the company announced it was withdrawing its bid for Hillshire after Tyson Foods had increased its offer to $8.55 billion.[9]
Purchased by JBS S.A.[edit]
On September 17, 2009, JBS USA Holdings, Inc. announced the purchase of 64% of the shares of Pilgrim's Pride. JBS USA Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Brazilian multinational JBS S.A., the largest meat processor in the world, and the largest by revenue. Currently JBS USA Holdings, Inc. owns 75.3% of the company.
As a result, Pilgrim's Pride closed its corporate offices in Texas and Georgia and moved its headquarters to Greeley, Colorado.[10] This move caused the former headquarters in Pittsburg, Texas, and a location in nearby Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to cut employment by a total of 160 people. Other locations which lost jobs included sites in Atlanta, Dallas, and Broadway, Virginia.[11] [12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
