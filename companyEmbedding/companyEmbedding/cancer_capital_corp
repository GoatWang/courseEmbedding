Dana Corporation



 Founded:
1904 



Years Operated:
1904 - Present 



Headquarters:
Maumee, Ohio 



Business:
Manufactures automotive parts 



Asbestos Trust:
No 



Bankruptcy Status:
Filed March 2006 and reorganized in December 2007 


History
Dana Corporation, currently operating as Dana Holding Corporation, was established in 1904 by a 29-year-old engineering student. After inventing a breakthrough car part, the Spicer Universal Joint, Clarence Spicer left Cornell University to found an automotive parts business in Plainfield, New Jersey.
Spicer originally incorporated his company as the Spicer Universal Joint Manufacturing Company in 1905, but changed the name to Spicer Manufacturing Company four years later. Spicer provided a wide range of automotive parts to companies like Buick, Wayne, Mack, Olds, Stevens-Duryea and American Motor Car Company. Some of these parts contained toxic asbestos materials, which made the company vulnerable to a slew of asbestos personal injury claims in decades to follow.
By 1914, the Spicer Company struggled with financial difficulties. Attorney and financier Charles Dana invested in the company shortly after, assuming the role of president in 1916. The Spicer Company relocated to Toledo, Ohio in 1928 and became the Dana Corporation in 1946. Two years later Charles Dana was named chairman of the board, and a series of acquisitions brought his company decades of success following World War II. Dana Corporation continued to expand its product line, purchasing automotive part suppliers such as the Perfect Circle Corporation in 1963 and the Victor Gasket Manufacturing Company in 1966.
By 2006 Dana Corporation once again faced financial problems, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection that year. Dana Corporation asserted that its asbestos liabilities, which totaled only 3 percent of its total debt in 2006, were not responsible for the bankruptcy. The previous year, however, the company defended a total of 88,000 pending asbestos claims.

In 2008, a group called the Ad Hoc Committee of Asbestos Claimants appealed Dana Corporation’s recently accepted reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The committee believed the company hadn’t set aside enough money to settle current and future asbestos claims.
Dana Corporation responded to the committee’s concerns, noting that it set aside $240 million in cash and other assets to cover future asbestos liabilities. The company based this figure on the number of active cases pending and the number of dismissed cases.
In one notable asbestos lawsuit, a former pipefitter sought recovery for his asbestos-related injuries in 2002. Louis Hicks filed the lawsuit against the Dana Corporation and 10 other asbestos companies after developing mesothelioma, a cancer that was caused by exposure to asbestos products he worked with over more than four decades.
Although Hicks passed away from his disease in 2003, his daughter continued the suit. The court found all 11 manufacturers responsible for Hicks’s illness, ordering them to pay his estate $5,000,000. Because ample evidence proved that Hicks was exposed to Dana Corporation asbestos gaskets, the company was ordered to pay Hicks’s estate $464,605.65.
Dana Holding Corp. had about 31,000 active pending asbestos claims as of June 30, 2010. Approximately 11,000 inactive claims were settled and waiting for final documentation before dismissal. In 2010, the company estimated that its asbestos liabilities would extend through the next 15 years.
Industries and Occupations
For decades, the Dana Corporation provided an array of asbestos-containing products to standard and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers. Thousands of individuals, ranging from automotive production workers to mechanics, have developed asbestos-related illnesses after exposure to these contaminated parts.
A common pathway for asbestos exposure is brake work, as replacing deteriorating asbestos brake pads can stir up dangerous levels of airborne fibers. Such conditions put any unprotected shop worker in the vicinity at risk for lung cancer, mesothelioma and other diseases. Dana Corporation also manufactured asbestos-containing gaskets, which may have affected the health of boiler workers, engine room workers and steam fitters.
Products
Dana Corporation products manufactured with asbestos ingredients include brake pads, brake linings, thermal management products, gaskets and seals. Asbestos could also be found in products that transmit power, such as universal joints, drive shafts, transmissions and axles.
In 2007, the company settled 7,500 claims involving asbestos gaskets. Dana announced it would pay a maximum of $2 million to settle all claims.
Dana Establishes VEBA Trust Fund
While the Dana Corporation has not established a trust fund to compensate all individuals harmed by its asbestos products, the company did create a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust fund for former employees of the company.
Replacing welfare and long-term disability benefits, the VEBA trust covers asbestos-related medical expenses for participants and their families. To fund the trust, Dana Corporation contributed approximately $700 million cash and $80 million in company stock.

Asbestos Exposure






Help Us Raise Awareness

Asbestos Exposure
Asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a rare, aggressive and incurable cancer. 
Asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present: At home, a public building such as a school or government office, a war fought on foreign soil or on the job.




Click to expand

In fact, occupational exposure is the No. 1 cause of asbestos disease. That means roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, firefighters, auto mechanics, insulators, factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure.
Those who worked in construction, shipyards, power plants, oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job.
U.S. military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products, especially on Navy ships.
For much of the 20th century, until its long-term toxicity became well known, thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance, versatility and tensile strength.

How Exposure Happens
Asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers. While no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe, most problems arise after repeated and long-term exposures to the carcinogen. 
Environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer, but it still happens regularly. Most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos, but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems.







"Asbestos-related disease is 100 percent preventable. That fact motivates me. It should motivate all of us. If we stopped using asbestos, by definition, we could stop asbestos disease." — Dr. Ken Takahashi, director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute


Harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings. Home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos. When asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut, sanded, drilled or disturbed in any way, microscopic fibers enter the air.
For example, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) took issue with the sandblasting practices of Alaska-based shipbuilding and repair facility Seward Ship's Drydock. The ADEC issued Seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled "fugitive particulate emissions" at its sandblasting operations.
If workers sandblasted asbestos-containing materials, such as paint, insulation or joint compounds, off of a vessel, the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area, and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them.
Fibers can remain airborne for hours, placing anyone nearby in danger. Once inhaled, they can become trapped in the respiratory tract, where they may stay for life.
Health Risks of Exposure
Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation, making breathing increasingly difficult.
They eventually will cause scarring, which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. In the early stages, symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until 20 to 50 years after the initial exposure.
Each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure. An estimated 10,000 Americans die annually from an asbestos-related disease. 
Currently, an estimated 200,000 people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestos-related illness.

Pleural plaques: These are the most common indication of asbestos exposure. They are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs.
Asbestosis: Asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally.
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not directly caused by asbestos, but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease.
Mesothelioma: This is a rare, aggressive and incurable asbestos-caused cancer.
Lung Cancer: Asbestos-related lung cancer accounts for approximately 4 percent of all lung cancer cases. Asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer. 

Where Exposure Occurs
Exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments, using asbestos-containing products or working in certain occupations, including the U.S. military. Exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters.


Military
Every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces incorporated asbestos. People on U.S. Navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early 1900s to the 1970s were most at risk. Since that time, thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service.

Battleships
Aircraft Carriers
Cruisers
Auxiliary Vessels
Submarines
Destroyers
Frigates

Products
Thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers. Asbestos may be found in insulation, drywall, ceiling and floor tiles, cements, paint and more. Most homes and commercial buildings built before 1980 contain asbestos products.
Search our asbestos products index


Occupations
Workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job. Drywall tapers, electricians, firefighters, auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk. While asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past, today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other job-related health risks.
See if your occupation was at risk for exposure


Job Sites
Asbestos exposure may occur while on the job. Many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities, placing millions of workers at risk for exposure.

Shipyards
Power Plants
Metal Works
Schools
Chemical Plants
Oil Refineries



Environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining, the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
In 2016, the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years, but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas. 
The study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising.
Researchers at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center conducted a similar study in 2015 that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in Nevada.
Northern California is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos. 
9/11 Attack on the World Trade Center
The terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, released more than 2,000 tons of asbestos into the air, causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months.
According to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, about 70 percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems. It found that 28 percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests. Researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble, along with nearby residents, for long-term health consequences related to asbestos and other toxic building materials.

Risks from Nearby Asbestos Operations
Job sites where workers mined, handled or processed asbestos often contaminated the outside air with airborne fibers. As a result, people in nearby communities may face environmental exposures that increase the risk for serious health complications.

Read About the Asbestos Cover Up



A 2009 study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant. The study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and other asbestos-related conditions in Shubra El-Kheima, Egypt, an industrial city containing the Sigwart Company asbestos plant. It compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant, those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure. In total, the study had more than 4,000 participants.
The rate of MPM was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure, with 2.8 percent of this group having the cancer. The group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only 0.8 percent. As expected, the control group had the fewest incidences, with a rate of 0.1 percent.
These rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening. Overall, the study found a slightly higher, but still comparable, rate of asbestos-related illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents.
Improper Abatement
If asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure, there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed. It is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks.
Secondhand Exposure
People can get an asbestos-related disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral. Secondhand exposure, or indirect exposure, can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure.
While any kind of exposure is much less common today than even 20 years ago, women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the mid-20th century.
At that time, men comprised the majority of the industrial working class. The occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestos-containing products. Workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair, skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them.
Occurrences of Secondhand Exposure
Secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children. If children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age, they may develop an asbestos-related disease in their adult years. There are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure.



Laundry
The clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure. Because of the jagged structure of the fibers, the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing. Anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure.





Furniture
If a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home, fibers could have become embedded in the couch, chairs, carpet, bed and other pieces of furniture.





Hugs
If a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair, skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse, family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen. Some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work.
While family members didn't have any direct contact with asbestos-containing products, the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life.
Between 1941 and 1954, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City studied the health of 679 family members from the 1,664 workers employed at a factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers' family members. Sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former Patterson factory workers 20 years after the factory shut down.

Legal Claims for Secondhand Exposure 
Like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos, claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation. In order to bring a successful legal claim, they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers. This usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job.


John Panza Jr., diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012.

For example, John Panza Jr., a 40-year-old English professor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012. For more than 30 years, his father worked at a brake plant where National Friction Products Corp. products were drilled and abraded. As a child, Panza helped his father wash his work clothes. In 2012, Panza filed a lawsuit against National Friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the company's products that contaminated his father's clothes.
In 2013, an Ohio jury found National Friction liable for Panza's illness. It ordered the company to pay Panza and his wife $27.5 million. The award included $515,000 in economic damages, $12 million in noneconomic damages and $15 million for the wife's loss of consortium claim. 
Protecting Yourself and Loved Ones
Despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life, people can protect themselves by being vigilant. 
Workers should use protective equipment provided by employers. It is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices. Approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers.
It also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family. Any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site. Showers should be taken before returning home.
Safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems.
If you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t adequately protecting you from asbestos, file an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Asbestos Products Manufacturers
Even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world, the industry continues to thrive. Concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than 50 nations — including the entire European Union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use. Strict U.S. regulations took hold in the 1970s. Yet countries like Russia, China, Brazil and Kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale.

At the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life. Since the late 1800s, American companies like the Johns Manville Corporation amassed great wealth by mining, manufacturing and selling asbestos-containing products. Centuries later, medical evidence revealed Johns Manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers.
In decades past, asbestos use was far more pervasive in the United States. Contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding, construction, power generation and heavy manufacturing. Since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the 1970s, asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy. In many cases, companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits.

While medical evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause life-threatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, the consumption of contaminated products in the United States and many other countries continues. According to a 2011 inventory of more than 60,000 asbestos-laden products, approximately 600 companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year.

Fast Fact: In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal acquired Mundet Cork, inheriting more than $700 million current and future asbestos liabilities.

History of Manufacturing

Although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years, it was only during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s that the industry flourished. A natural resistance to heat, chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications. Soon enough, manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines, piping and locomotives. Thousands of other uses later emerged, and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers, gaskets, cement, roofing materials and automotive brake pads.


By the early 20th century, some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers. But rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards, some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation. Internal documents indicate that Johns Manville executives were aware of the risks as early as 1934. The company conducted private medical studies around this time, and the negative results remained confidential for decades.


Asbestos use increased throughout World War II, largely because of military shipbuilding contracts. The U.S. government required asbestos insulation be used in U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. For several decades after the war, hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products.

In addition to Johns Manville, other leading asbestos manufacturers include:

Owens Corning/Fibreboard Corp.
Raybestos-Manhattan Co.
National Gypsum Corporation
W.R. Grace & Co.
Celotex Corp.


By the 1960s, scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestos's harmful effects. One landmark occupational study conducted by Dr. Irving Selikoff in 1964 showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers. Results indicated that between 1943 and 1962, an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Selikoff's findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use. The result was a significant downturn for America's asbestos industry.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dealt another blow to the industry with the Clean Air Act of 1970. It established the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants. Several new regulations directly affected the industry, specifically companies that milled, sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials. By the late 1970s, many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products.


Although the U.S. Geological Survey asserts that U.S. asbestos use has fallen 99.9 percent since 1973, it is not yet banned in the United States. Limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials, building materials like cement and in various textiles.

Fast Fact: A C & S stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in 1974, but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade.

Products

During the peak era of asbestos consumption, it was incorporated into approximately 3,000 types of products. One of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products, a use that spanned industries including construction, shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing.


Countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos, including ceiling tiles, joint compounds, cement, drywall and roofing materials. These products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions, as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air.


The toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope, cloth and garments. Shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient.


Another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry. Many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction, such as gaskets and brake pads, contained some percentage of asbestos.

Industries & Occupations

According to the World Health Organization, about 125 million people experience workplace exposure worldwide. By far, the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral. These activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air.


Another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction. While drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks, many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project.


Shipyard workers, especially during the World War II era, experienced heavy exposure as well. Tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels, and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous. Also at risk were pipefitters, boiler workers and electricians who serviced U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships.


Litigation & Specific Lawsuits


A staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades, jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos. According to one litigation report from 2002, an estimated 730,000 people filed related claims against at least 8,400 corporations.


Some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimillion-dollar verdicts or out-of-court settlements. When courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death, they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and loss of consortium. Many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings.


In one standout 2005 case, U.S. Steel was ordered to pay $250 million to Roby Whittington, the wife of a former U.S. Steel employee who died of mesothelioma. Several other manufacturers defended the case, but U.S. Steel was found 100 percent liable for Whittington’s death. Georgia-Pacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the jury awarded Mrs. Whittington $50 million in damages and $200 million in punitive damages.


A San Francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to Alfred Todak, holding more than 25 firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis. A former electrician, Todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard Navy vessels from 1960 to 1976. Eighteen firms settled with Todak out of court for a total of $4.2 million, and Foster Wheeler Ltd. contributed 30 percent of the jury’s $22.7 million verdict. Todak’s wife also received $11 million for related losses.


More recently, a 2011 lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of $22 million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets. The gasket manufacturers, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Goodyear Canada, were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of Walter Koczur and Eugene McCarthy, despite both being longtime smokers.

Fast Fact: Pittsburgh Corning announced in 2009 that it would pay out $825 million in cash over the next 15 years to cover asbestos-related claims.


Trust Funds


With multibillion-dollar liabilities looming, many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain, yet steadily rising, costs of legal compensation. The U.S. government estimates that more than 100 companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation, including industry giants like National Gypsum, Dana Corporation and EaglePicher Industries.


As part of their reorganization plans, companies often create personal injury trusts. Forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court, designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation. Bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities.


Since Johns Manville created the first trust in 1987, nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust. By 2011, these trusts had awarded a total of $17.5 billion. Some of the largest trusts include:
