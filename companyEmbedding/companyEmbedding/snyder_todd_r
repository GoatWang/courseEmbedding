About the New York State Gaming Commission
The New York State Gaming Commission regulates all aspects of gaming activity in the State, including horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering, Class III Indian Gaming, the state lottery (including video lottery terminals) and charitable gaming.
The Commission was created by Chapter 60 of the Laws of 2012.
The law merged the New York State Racing and Wagering Board with the New York State Division of Lottery into a single state agency. 
The Commission became effective February 1, 2013.
 
Mission Statement
The New York State Gaming Commission's mission is to ensure that all lawful gaming and horse racing activity conducted in this State is of the highest integrity, credibility and quality. Operating in the most efficient and transparent manner, the Commission conducts the New York Lottery and serves the best interests of the public by providing responsive and effective state gaming regulation. The Commission strives to ensure that all stakeholders in the gaming and horse racing industries, including the consumers who wager on activities regulated or operated by the Commission, are treated in an equitable and responsible manner and to promote the health and safety of horses and all participants in racing. By consolidating various regulatory functions into one oversight body with broad powers, the Commission seeks to ensure fair and strict regulation of all gaming activity while reducing costs and regulatory burdens to the gaming industry. The Commission aspires to provide the regulatory structure necessary for New York gaming activity to operate effectively in a global, evolving and increasingly competitive marketplace to generate revenue for aid to education and for the support of government, and to contribute to overall economic development and job creation in New York.

Contracting Opportunities




The New York State Gaming Commission procures goods and services in accordance with Article 11 of the New York State Finance Law. State procurements facilitate each agency's mission while protecting the interests of the State and the public and promoting fairness in contracting with businesses.
Competitively Awarded Contract: A contract awarded pursuant to an IFB or RFP.

• Invitation for Bids (IFB): The procurement method in which the award is based on the lowest bid. An IFB describes the administrative process; defines specifications; establishes required delivery terms, bidder qualifications, method of award, and contract provisions, and includes instructions for submitting a bid.
• Request for Proposals (RFP): The procurement method in which the award is based on a combination of cost and technical factors (Best Value). An RFP is generally used to procure services or technology in situations where price is not the sole determining factor. Through its proposal, a vendor offers a solution to the objectives, problems, or needs specified in the RFP and defines how it intends to meet or exceed the RFP requirements.

Sole Source Contract:A sole source contract is awarded when only one vendor can supply the required goods or services.
Single Source Contract:A single source contract is awarded when although there are two or more potential offerors, the agency determines that it is in the best interest of the State to procure from a particular offeror.
Piggyback Contract: The use of another governmental entity's contract is referred to as "piggybacking." The Office of General Services can authorize purchases by a State agency from a contract awarded by another New York State agency, the United States government another State. 
Discretionary Purchases: Procurements made below statutorily established monetary levels and at the discretion of a State agency, without the need for a competitive procurement process. Discretionary purchasing streamlines the procurement process. It also improves opportunities for Minority or Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) vendors and New York State Small Businesses to secure business with the State and promotes the use of recycled or remanufactured goods. 
MWBE and Small Business Opportunities: It is the public policy of the State to promote and encourage the continuing economic development and participation of minority-owned, women-owned and small businesses in the State procurement process as prime contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. 
New York State certification gives a business the opportunity to be listed in a statewide Directory of Certified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises used by State agencies and contractors. To learn more about the MWBE program or to be certified as a New York State minority or woman-owned business, contact the Department of Economic Development's Division of Minority and Women's Business Development at www.nylovesmwbe.ny.gov/. 
For future procurement opportunities with the Commission and New York State, subscribe to the New York State Contract Reporter, an electronic newsletter containing notices of State agency, public authority and public benefit corporation procurement solicitations. New York State businesses may subscribe on-line at www.nyscr.org. 
For more information on New York State Commission procurements, please contact the Commission's Contracting Officer at ContractingOfficer@gaming.ny.gov.

About the New York State Gaming Commission
The New York State Gaming Commission regulates all aspects of gaming activity in the State, including horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering, Class III Indian Gaming, the state lottery (including video lottery terminals) and charitable gaming.
The Commission was created by Chapter 60 of the Laws of 2012.
The law merged the New York State Racing and Wagering Board with the New York State Division of Lottery into a single state agency. 
The Commission became effective February 1, 2013.
 
Mission Statement
The New York State Gaming Commission's mission is to ensure that all lawful gaming and horse racing activity conducted in this State is of the highest integrity, credibility and quality. Operating in the most efficient and transparent manner, the Commission conducts the New York Lottery and serves the best interests of the public by providing responsive and effective state gaming regulation. The Commission strives to ensure that all stakeholders in the gaming and horse racing industries, including the consumers who wager on activities regulated or operated by the Commission, are treated in an equitable and responsible manner and to promote the health and safety of horses and all participants in racing. By consolidating various regulatory functions into one oversight body with broad powers, the Commission seeks to ensure fair and strict regulation of all gaming activity while reducing costs and regulatory burdens to the gaming industry. The Commission aspires to provide the regulatory structure necessary for New York gaming activity to operate effectively in a global, evolving and increasingly competitive marketplace to generate revenue for aid to education and for the support of government, and to contribute to overall economic development and job creation in New York.

Contracting Opportunities




The New York State Gaming Commission procures goods and services in accordance with Article 11 of the New York State Finance Law. State procurements facilitate each agency's mission while protecting the interests of the State and the public and promoting fairness in contracting with businesses.
Competitively Awarded Contract: A contract awarded pursuant to an IFB or RFP.

• Invitation for Bids (IFB): The procurement method in which the award is based on the lowest bid. An IFB describes the administrative process; defines specifications; establishes required delivery terms, bidder qualifications, method of award, and contract provisions, and includes instructions for submitting a bid.
• Request for Proposals (RFP): The procurement method in which the award is based on a combination of cost and technical factors (Best Value). An RFP is generally used to procure services or technology in situations where price is not the sole determining factor. Through its proposal, a vendor offers a solution to the objectives, problems, or needs specified in the RFP and defines how it intends to meet or exceed the RFP requirements.

Sole Source Contract:A sole source contract is awarded when only one vendor can supply the required goods or services.
Single Source Contract:A single source contract is awarded when although there are two or more potential offerors, the agency determines that it is in the best interest of the State to procure from a particular offeror.
Piggyback Contract: The use of another governmental entity's contract is referred to as "piggybacking." The Office of General Services can authorize purchases by a State agency from a contract awarded by another New York State agency, the United States government another State. 
Discretionary Purchases: Procurements made below statutorily established monetary levels and at the discretion of a State agency, without the need for a competitive procurement process. Discretionary purchasing streamlines the procurement process. It also improves opportunities for Minority or Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) vendors and New York State Small Businesses to secure business with the State and promotes the use of recycled or remanufactured goods. 
MWBE and Small Business Opportunities: It is the public policy of the State to promote and encourage the continuing economic development and participation of minority-owned, women-owned and small businesses in the State procurement process as prime contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. 
New York State certification gives a business the opportunity to be listed in a statewide Directory of Certified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises used by State agencies and contractors. To learn more about the MWBE program or to be certified as a New York State minority or woman-owned business, contact the Department of Economic Development's Division of Minority and Women's Business Development at www.nylovesmwbe.ny.gov/. 
For future procurement opportunities with the Commission and New York State, subscribe to the New York State Contract Reporter, an electronic newsletter containing notices of State agency, public authority and public benefit corporation procurement solicitations. New York State businesses may subscribe on-line at www.nyscr.org. 
For more information on New York State Commission procurements, please contact the Commission's Contracting Officer at ContractingOfficer@gaming.ny.gov.
