Investment Risks: Bonds offer a relatively stable level of income, although bond prices will fluctuate providing the potential for principal gain or loss. Intermediate-term, higher-quality bonds generally offer less risk than longer-term bonds and a lower rate of return. Generally, a strategy’s fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa. Although a strategy’s yield may be higher than that of fixed income strategies that purchase higher-rated securities, the potentially higher yield is a function of the greater risk that the fund’s share price will decline. Mortgage-backed investments involve risk of loss due to prepayments and, like any bond, due to default. Because of the sensitivity of mortgage-related securities to changes in interest rates, a strategy’s performance may be more volatile than if it did not hold these securities. U.S. Government guarantees apply only to the underlying securities of a strategy's portfolio and not the strategy’s shares. Floating rate loans are typically senior and secured, in contrast to other below investment grade securities. However, there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral will not decline, causing a loan to be substantially unsecured. Loans generally are subject to restrictions on resale. Certain types of loans may limit the ability of a strategy to enforce its rights and may involve assuming additional credit risks. The geographical concentration of portfolio holdings in a strategy may involve increased risk. A strategy's income may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, depending on your tax status, the federal alternative minimum tax.
Investment process, strategies, and procedures detailed in this website are intended to be general guidelines, subject to market conditions and client-specific investment guidelines and restrictions, and are measured at time of purchase. Seix Investment Advisors LLC may deviate from these guidelines if market conditions warrant, or if the investment professionals deem doing so would be in the clients’ best interests. Guidelines do not guarantee any reduction of risk or loss.
