434 Union Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn







12.0%Annualized Return


18-monthsInvestment Term


 












Accredited investors have the opportunity to invest and receive a 12.0% annualized net return, paid monthly, in a Preferred Equity position guaranteed by the Sponsor. The investment is senior to the Sponsor’s equity but junior to first lien construction debt, which is also guaranteed by the Sponsor and/or Borrowing entity. Investors will receive 100% of principal and their targeted 12.0% net return before the Sponsor participates in sale proceeds.












National Realty Investment Advisors (“NRIA” / “Sponsor”) invites accredited investors to participate in the short-term acquisition, complete renovation, and conversion of a four-unit multifamily property (the “Property”) into a boutique three-unit high-end condominium development, located in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. The Property is currently under contract, and will be NRIA’s eighth Brooklyn development of similar size & scope since mid-Q2 2016.
The Property is more specifically located between Bond & Hoyt, just ≈2.5-miles south of Manhattan, ≈1.5-miles from the Brooklyn Bridge, and also within a short-walking distance to numerous subway lines making for an easy commute anywhere in NYC.
Upon acquisition, NRIA has devised a 17-month development plan (that may be extended to a maximum of 20-months, but also may be accelerated) that includes a complete renovation to efficiently maximize & modernize the usable square footage at the Property. The renovation period will be followed by an estimated 3-month marketing process (completed by marketing partner: Compass), whereby the finished condominium units (proposed plans: 434 Union Street) have been conservatively estimated to command ≈$1,460psf on average, based on a current sales comparison analysis (comps currently average ≈$1,508psf).












Unique Risk / Reward Investment Profile: In a world where all investors remain challenged to produce any yield to speak of, and with many global economists believing we are returning to normal – away from relatively high interest rates and the resultant higher yields on bonds and other investment types for years to come, it seems logical prudent investors will shift investment interests to alternatives such as real estate located in core urban markets, managed by superior sponsorship. The steady flow of income creates a natural hedge against unanticipated inflation without sacrificing expected return. The subject investment is defined as a short duration (17-to-18-month), high-yield investment – offering a 12.0% net return, paid monthly. This current pay structure compensates investors immediately and throughout the development process with an additional illiquidity premium generally reserved for longer-term investment profiles. Moreover, our constructive view on the market should help our investment partners continually generate excess returns over the longer term horizon.
Equity Cushion upon Exit, and additional Sponsor Credit Enhancement(s): NRIA conservatively estimated total gross and net sales proceeds of $6.003 million and $5.778 million, respectively, implying an as-completed price PSF of $1,460 (average), or a very healthy ≈14% margin1 over total project costs after returning all principal. Moreover, our sell-out value estimate is considerably lower than the average comparable sale in the market of $1,508psf, as well as a third party appraisal estimate of $1,587psf, which if either were achieved would result in margins1 of ≈17% and ≈23%, respectively. There clearly remains a substantial equity cushion vs. the breakeven price PSF or where the NRIA Buy-Back price is set (see below, “ii”). It is this equity cushion that insures against a certain margin of error, with the Sponsor eligible for profits only after sell-out. In addition to the above, NRIA has made other significant credit enhancements available to the investor(s) through:
(i)The borrowing entity (Union Street Capital 434, LLC), and flowing through to the managing member entity (NRIA 434 Union Manager, LLC) executing recourse to standard lender carve-outs and/or completion guarantees, in addition to the completion guarantee provided by the general contractor. This structure is intended to mitigate and distribute any perceived risk associated with growing contingent liabilities. Due to the [current] ongoing negotiations with the construction lender(s), there also may be an element of cross-collateralization with the underlying Property and a similar NRIA sponsored loan (maximum of two properties). The final structure will be detailed in the operating agreement; however, NRIA anticipated these structural nuances and enhanced the investors position further through …
(ii)The NRIA Buy-Back agreement (Put-Option), whereby NRIA will acquire and pay investors for any unsold finished unit(s) at the end of the investment term in an amount (“breakeven price”) guaranteed to return all investor capital. In the unlikely event the targeted sellout price points were not met, the investment stability & low correlation of the NYC housing market vs. other markets, broader S&P and/or REIT volatility, etc. (see further information), clearly make this an ideal longer-term rental investment for one of NRIA’s many high-net-worth partners utilizing their pledged asset loan option (further information available upon request).
(iii)The NRIA Fixed Cost agreement, which requires the GC to cover all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates the need for additional investor capital calls.
Ultimately, these structural features further illustrate NRIA’s ability to execute, and speak to how high we rank capital preservation.
Cost Efficiency / Fixed Cost Construction Contract: NRIA’s proprietary construction bidding process, volume of purchasing, and history with a core-team of development partners (contractors, architects, engineers, building suppliers, etc.), have effectively created certain economies of scale as it relates to overall project costs. Furthermore, with over 90% of NRIA’s completed projects being with our core GC (US Construction, Inc.), and within budget, both parties feel very comfortable executing a Fixed Cost Contract on all new projects, whereby the GC covers all cost overruns during the duration of the project, eliminating potential delays due solely to cost disputes, etc. Construction costs are estimated at ≈$340psf at 434 Union Street, with finishes at an appraised quality standard of “Q1” (exceptional, high-end custom build). Please note, these figures are far less than quotes given by “retail” contractors as high as ≈$500psf(+).
 
The Property is located in a Prime, Urban, Growing area of Brooklyn: NYC’s largest and fastest growing borough (population growth: +5.3%, 2010 – 2015), Brooklyn has over 2.6 million residents, and if it was defined as its own City it would be the 4th largest in the US. The Property is more specifically located within the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, bordering the newly created waterfront esplanade park along the Gowanus Canal where significant new luxury [rental] development is being completed. The neighborhood is just 2.25 – 2.5-miles from Manhattan, and centrally located within walking distance to public transportation (see Property map). Brooklyn has emerged as an incubator for technology, advertising, media, design, and innovation, which is shown through the (i) ≈120% increase in patent filings in Brooklyn over the last 5-years alone, and (ii) the number of adults with advanced degrees moving to Brooklyn tripling from 2009 to 20131. Population & job growth, shortage of new “affordable” supply, continued household formation, lack of developable air rights in the neighborhood, and interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future, are all important underlying fundamentals that should continue to drive robust growth for many years to come.









 




Market



















“Charming Suburban Utopia” 434 Union Street is located along a tree-lined block in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, between Bond & Hoyt Streets, anchored by the elementary school of PS 32 and the Carroll Gardens School of Innovation (MS 442).

The Property is located just a few blocks from the only Whole Foods Market in Brooklyn, number of restaurants, boutiques, and many public & private education options.

How Limited is Limited Liability?
One of the key advantages of a limited liability company (LLC) over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners (members) of the LLC are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business.  Normally, that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier, lender, landlord or other creditor, that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the LLC.  The members may lose their entire investment in the business, but their other assets - car, home, and personal bank accounts - are safe from the creditors of the business.
Or are they?  In truth, there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability. Many LLC members will find that, due to the way the business was operated, the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful.
How Personal Liability Arises
A member of an LLC can be held personally liable for many different types of claims, but they typically arise under four different scenarios:

Claims arising out of an act or omission by the member, such as the member's own negligence, fraud or illegal act
Claims arising out of a contract, particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member
Claims based on the concept of "piercing the veil" of the LLC
Liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the LLC's operating agreement or the applicable LLC statute

These claims are not a result of choosing an LLC as a form of entity.  All of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and, in fact, the exceptions were developed first under corporate law.
Actions of a Member
Every member who actively participates in the business of the LLC runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability.  This is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service.  If you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone, your LLC is not going to protect you.  
Similarly, if you make promises about your product or service that are not true, the first claim may be against the LLC for breach of contract, but if the LLC cannot perform or pay damages, the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action.
Even if you have an employee who committed the action, you may not be out of the woods.  If you personally hired the employee, the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee.
A special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an LLC is failure to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.  To protect these so-called "trust fund taxes," any person who had the ability to prevent the non-payment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes.  The IRS applies this provision broadly, so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didn't, you are probably liable.
Claims Based on Contract
Another, and probably more common, source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability, usually by means of a personal guarantee.  For many small businesses, particularly new businesses with no credit history, obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible.  Landlords, too, often insist on a personal guarantee, particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as build-outs that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease.
Suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit, especially after the business is up and running.  Getting payment terms out of the gate, however, often requires a personal guarantee.
Even when the creditor isn't seeking a personal guarantee, a member of the LLC can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role. If she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the LLC, it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract. Every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the LLC (full name!) and should indicate the role of the person who is signing (member or manager).
Piercing the Veil of the LLC
Even if a member avoids personal guarantees, he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as "piercing the corporate veil." Although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice.
In almost all cases of piercing the veil, there is either commingling or diversion of assets.  Some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include: 

Inadequate capitalization
Failure to issue stock
Failure to observe corporate formalities
Nonpayment of dividends
Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time
Non-functioning of other officers or directors
Absence of corporate records
Commingling of funds
Diversion of assets
Failure to maintain arm's length relationships among related entities
Whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders

A possible benefit of an LLC over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors (failure to issue stock, failure to observe corporate formalities, and absence of corporate records) have no real counterparts in an LLC.  However, as case law develops, the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors.
Distributions in Violation of Law or Agreement
LLC Acts typically prohibit an LLC from making certain distributions.  For example, the final draft of the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution: (1) the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities; or (2) the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.
A member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution  is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions. In addition, a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the Act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper.
Is Limited Liability an Illusion?
Although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule, the LLC offers excellent protection from many types of 
liabilities.  For example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud, the LLC should shield you from personal liability.  If you sell a product that, without your knowledge or fault, is defective, you should not have personal liability.  Trade creditors who deal with the LLC without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment.
Shoring up Limited Liability
There are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the LLC:
Business insurance.  Carrying adequate business insurance won't change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence, but it can help by providing a source for payment.  You might also consider a personal umbrella policy.
Avoid personal guarantees.  Not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee.  In many cases, landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided.  Learn to question the request.
Capitalize the business adequately.  Provide adequate capital for the entity's intended purposes and document the capital infusion.
Keep the LLC separate from your personal business.  No matter how small the business is, it should have its own bank account.  Don't pay personal expenses from the business account.  Instead, write yourself a check (called a draw) on the LLC account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses.  Likewise, don't use personal checks to pay LLC bills.  If the LLC needs funds, make a capital contribution or loan.  And account for everything.
Act ethically.  Don't attempt to mislead the LLC's creditors about the financial condition of the business.
Do not divert assets.  If the business looks like it is going down, don't attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the LLC.  That will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets.
If you act responsibly and take a few precautions, the limited liability of the LLC is still a major benefit over a sole proprietorship or general partnership.
