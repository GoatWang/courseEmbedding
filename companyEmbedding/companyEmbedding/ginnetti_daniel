5 References


Education
Ginnetti has a B.S. degree in Business Economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.[1]

Professional Career
Prior to joining Stericycle, Ginnetti held various finance and accounting positions with The Ralph M. Parsons Company, a worldwide engineering firm, and Ryan Herco Products Corp., a national industrial plastics distributor.[1]

Stericycle
Daniel Ginnetti was named as Chief Financial Officer of Stericycle effective August 1, 2014. He joined Stericycle as Area Vice President of Finance in 2003. In 2004 he was promoted to Area Vice President for Stericycle’s Western, and later, Midwestern business units. Following that, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations for the United States and Canada. He returned to financial management in 2013, becoming Vice President of Corporate Finance and then CFO in August 2014.[1]

Aid to the Abortion Industry
Stericycle has chosen to work for abortion facilities to dispose of the fetal remains from abortions.[2] Stericycle’s aid allows these clinics to continue killing preborn children. Because Ginnetti holds a position of leadership in the company and profits from Stericycle’s collaboration with the abortion industry, responsibility for Stericycle’s actions falls upon him.

 Educational Background



B.S. in Business Economics 


University of California - Santa Barbara

                  The University of California, Santa Barbara (commonly referred to as UC Santa Barbara or UCSB) is a public research university and one of the 10 general campuses of the University of California system. The main campus is located on a 1,022-acre (414 ha) site near Goleta, California, United States, 8 miles (13 km) from Santa Barbara and 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Los Angeles. Tracing its roots back to 1891 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the University of California system in 1944 and is the third-oldest general-education campus in the system.
UCSB traces its origins back to the Anna Blake School which was founded in 1891 and offered training in home economics and industrial arts. The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School. Intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara, led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase, persuaded the State Legislature, Governor Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system in 1944. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the Governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed, however, to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses. From 1944 to 1958 the school was known as Santa Barbara College of the University of California, before taking on its current name. When the vacated Marine Corps training station in Goleta was purchased for the rapidly-growing college, Santa Barbara City College moved into the vacated State College buildings.
