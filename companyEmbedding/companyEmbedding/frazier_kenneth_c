Early life[edit]
Kenneth Frazier was born on December 17, 1954, in North Philadelphia.[1] His father, Otis, was a janitor.[1][2] Frazier has said Thurgood Marshall was one of his heroes growing up.[3] Frazier's mother died when he was twelve years old.[1] He attended Northeast High School. After graduating at age 16, he entered Pennsylvania State University.[3] To make extra money in college, he raised tadpoles and newts and sold them to local stores.[4]
After earning his B.A. from Penn State, Frazier enrolled at Harvard University to study law.[5] He graduated in 1978 with a J.D.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Drinker Biddle[edit]
Frazier started his law career at Drinker Biddle & Reath after graduating from Harvard in Philadelphia.[3] In 1991, Esther Lardent, head of the Death Penalty Representation Project, asked Frazier to defend death row inmate James Willie "Bo" Cochran.[1] Cochran had been arrested and accused of murdering an assistant manager at a Birmingham grocery store in 1976.[6] Frazier, then a partner at Drinker Biddle, and two colleagues took the case.[4] In 1995, after 19 years on death row, the 11th United States Courts of Appeals overturned Cochran's conviction. In 1997, Cochran was retried and found not guilty.[6] Frazier continued to represent him after leaving Drinker Biddle. During Frazier's law career, he also took four summer sabbaticals to teach trial advocacy in South Africa.[2]
Merck & Co.[edit]
As a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, one of Frazier's clients was Merck & Co., the second-largest drug company in the United States.[3][4] In 1992, he joined Merck & Co.'s public affairs division as general counsel.[3][7] Frazier was named senior general counsel in 1999.[8] As general counsel, he was credited with overseeing the company's defense against claims that the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx had caused heart attacks and strokes.[4][8][9] Analysts at the time estimated Merck & Co.'s liability to range from 20 to 50 billion dollars.[10] Frazier said the case was "the most significant challenge [he'd] ever faced."[4] He chose to fight all cases in court rather than settle them all quickly.[7] The remaining cases were settled in 2007 for $4.85 billion.[8]
In 2006, Frazier was promoted to executive vice president in addition to his role as general counsel.[8] He led the company's largest group, human health from 2007 until he was named president of Merck & Co. in April 2010.[3][11] On January 1, 2011 he became CEO and a member of the company's board of directors, replacing former Merck & Co. CEO Richard Clark.[3][12] Frazier was the first African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company.[1]
As CEO, Frazier has directed the company to take financial risks in developing new treatments.[10] In 2013, he prioritized research funding over meeting the year's earnings target.[7] He has placed special emphasis on improving treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Frazier's father died from Alzheimer's. Frazier has said he is also motivated at Merck & Co. by a desire to improve the lives of people in developing countries.[10]
Frazier received a total compensation of $21,387,205 in 2014. According to the "annual collaborative report" from Equilar and The New York Times, Frazier[13] ranked 66th in the May 2015 list of "200 highest-paid CEOs of large publicly traded companies" and seventh in the list of biopharmaceutical executives with the highest total compensation.[14][14]
In July 2016, Frazier sold 60,000 shares of the firm's stock. The stock was sold at an average price of $64.44.[15]
Other work[edit]
On November 11, 2011, as a member of the Penn State board of trustees, the board selected Frazier as chairman of a commission empaneled to investigate a child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and allegations of a cover up by university officials.[16] The commission retained the private law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan as "Special Investigative Counsel" who then hired Pepper Hamilton, legal counsel for Merck & Co.. The report, costing the university $6.5 million, was accepted and used as the basis for the NCAA sanctions against Penn State.[17] Frazier was criticized by attorney William Cluck and other Penn State alumni for his role in the Penn State Board of Trustees' handling of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, particularly its decision to fire head football coach Joe Paterno.[18] Frazier responded to Mr. Cluck with a tirade, saying to the light-skinned Mr. Cluck, "If you cared about that, you are one of the few people in this country that looks like you who actually believes the O.J. Simpson not guilty verdict was correct."[19] Mr. Frazier issued a minimal apology shortly after the event and then, with the benefit of counsel from Merck & Co., a more thorough apology, for the inappropriate outburst.[20]
Frazier is a member of the American Law Institute and serves on its Council. In May 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the ALI Annual Dinner, offering "some reflections on my experiences as a lawyer in private and in-house practice, and from my current vantage point as CEO of a global healthcare company on the importance of our legal system and lawyers for business, for society and for all of our people."[21]

Early life[edit]
Kenneth Frazier was born on December 17, 1954, in North Philadelphia.[1] His father, Otis, was a janitor.[1][2] Frazier has said Thurgood Marshall was one of his heroes growing up.[3] Frazier's mother died when he was twelve years old.[1] He attended Northeast High School. After graduating at age 16, he entered Pennsylvania State University.[3] To make extra money in college, he raised tadpoles and newts and sold them to local stores.[4]
After earning his B.A. from Penn State, Frazier enrolled at Harvard University to study law.[5] He graduated in 1978 with a J.D.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Drinker Biddle[edit]
Frazier started his law career at Drinker Biddle & Reath after graduating from Harvard in Philadelphia.[3] In 1991, Esther Lardent, head of the Death Penalty Representation Project, asked Frazier to defend death row inmate James Willie "Bo" Cochran.[1] Cochran had been arrested and accused of murdering an assistant manager at a Birmingham grocery store in 1976.[6] Frazier, then a partner at Drinker Biddle, and two colleagues took the case.[4] In 1995, after 19 years on death row, the 11th United States Courts of Appeals overturned Cochran's conviction. In 1997, Cochran was retried and found not guilty.[6] Frazier continued to represent him after leaving Drinker Biddle. During Frazier's law career, he also took four summer sabbaticals to teach trial advocacy in South Africa.[2]
Merck & Co.[edit]
As a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, one of Frazier's clients was Merck & Co., the second-largest drug company in the United States.[3][4] In 1992, he joined Merck & Co.'s public affairs division as general counsel.[3][7] Frazier was named senior general counsel in 1999.[8] As general counsel, he was credited with overseeing the company's defense against claims that the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx had caused heart attacks and strokes.[4][8][9] Analysts at the time estimated Merck & Co.'s liability to range from 20 to 50 billion dollars.[10] Frazier said the case was "the most significant challenge [he'd] ever faced."[4] He chose to fight all cases in court rather than settle them all quickly.[7] The remaining cases were settled in 2007 for $4.85 billion.[8]
In 2006, Frazier was promoted to executive vice president in addition to his role as general counsel.[8] He led the company's largest group, human health from 2007 until he was named president of Merck & Co. in April 2010.[3][11] On January 1, 2011 he became CEO and a member of the company's board of directors, replacing former Merck & Co. CEO Richard Clark.[3][12] Frazier was the first African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company.[1]
As CEO, Frazier has directed the company to take financial risks in developing new treatments.[10] In 2013, he prioritized research funding over meeting the year's earnings target.[7] He has placed special emphasis on improving treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Frazier's father died from Alzheimer's. Frazier has said he is also motivated at Merck & Co. by a desire to improve the lives of people in developing countries.[10]
Frazier received a total compensation of $21,387,205 in 2014. According to the "annual collaborative report" from Equilar and The New York Times, Frazier[13] ranked 66th in the May 2015 list of "200 highest-paid CEOs of large publicly traded companies" and seventh in the list of biopharmaceutical executives with the highest total compensation.[14][14]
In July 2016, Frazier sold 60,000 shares of the firm's stock. The stock was sold at an average price of $64.44.[15]
Other work[edit]
On November 11, 2011, as a member of the Penn State board of trustees, the board selected Frazier as chairman of a commission empaneled to investigate a child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and allegations of a cover up by university officials.[16] The commission retained the private law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan as "Special Investigative Counsel" who then hired Pepper Hamilton, legal counsel for Merck & Co.. The report, costing the university $6.5 million, was accepted and used as the basis for the NCAA sanctions against Penn State.[17] Frazier was criticized by attorney William Cluck and other Penn State alumni for his role in the Penn State Board of Trustees' handling of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, particularly its decision to fire head football coach Joe Paterno.[18] Frazier responded to Mr. Cluck with a tirade, saying to the light-skinned Mr. Cluck, "If you cared about that, you are one of the few people in this country that looks like you who actually believes the O.J. Simpson not guilty verdict was correct."[19] Mr. Frazier issued a minimal apology shortly after the event and then, with the benefit of counsel from Merck & Co., a more thorough apology, for the inappropriate outburst.[20]
Frazier is a member of the American Law Institute and serves on its Council. In May 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the ALI Annual Dinner, offering "some reflections on my experiences as a lawyer in private and in-house practice, and from my current vantage point as CEO of a global healthcare company on the importance of our legal system and lawyers for business, for society and for all of our people."[21]

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  8/2/2012 
 Pharmaceutical executive, lawyer, and corporate general counsel Kenneth C. Frazier was born on December 17, 1954 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to janitor and former sharecropper Otis Tindley Frazier and homemaker Clara Elizabeth Frazier. The second of three children, Frazier grew up in the deeply impoverished neighborhood of North Philadelphia. Frazier’s parents strongly encouraged education and hard work, ensuring that each of their children knew what it took to succeed. In 1966, when Frazier was twelve, his mother passed away, leaving Otis Frazier to raise three children alone. Frazier graduated from Northeast High School in Philadelphia before attending Pennsylvania State University. Upon completing his B.A. degree in 1975 with highest honors, Frazier enrolled at Harvard Law School, receiving his J.D. degree in 1978.
For the next fourteen years, Frazier worked as a lawyer and, eventually, partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Drinker, Biddle, & Reath. There he represented many corporate clients, including AlliedSignal and Merck & Co., Inc. However, the case which brought Frazier the most praise during this time was the pro bono work he contributed to freeing the innocent Willie “Bo” Cochran after twenty-one years on death row. Frazier accepted a position at Merck & Co., Inc in 1992. Frazier has served in various capacities at Merck, including general counsel, secretary, and vice president. During his tenure as general counsel, Frazier achieved great success in leading the company through more than 5,000 lawsuits regarding the alleged harmful effects of Vioxx.
In 2007, Frazier accepted the role of president of Merck & Co., Inc, and was given the additional roles of CEO and chairman in 2011, making him the first African American to serve as CEO of a major pharmaceutical company.  Frazier has served on the boards of several organizations, such as Exxon Mobil, Penn State University, and Cornerstone Christian Academy, a private charter school serving at-risk youth in Philadelphia, which he also co-founded. Due to his professional success and his position on the board of trustees, Frazier was selected to lead the investigation of the allegations against former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and university officials. Frazier has received numerous awards, including the 2001 Penn State Alumni Fellow Award, the Association of Corporate Counsel’s 2004 Excellence in Corporate Practice Award, and the Equal Justice Initiative’s 2009 Equal Justice Champion award. 
Frazier lives in Pennsylvania with his wife, Andréa, and their son, James. Their daughter, Lauren, is an engineer.
Frazier was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on August 2, 2012.

Early life[edit]
Kenneth Frazier was born on December 17, 1954, in North Philadelphia.[1] His father, Otis, was a janitor.[1][2] Frazier has said Thurgood Marshall was one of his heroes growing up.[3] Frazier's mother died when he was twelve years old.[1] He attended Northeast High School. After graduating at age 16, he entered Pennsylvania State University.[3] To make extra money in college, he raised tadpoles and newts and sold them to local stores.[4]
After earning his B.A. from Penn State, Frazier enrolled at Harvard University to study law.[5] He graduated in 1978 with a J.D.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Drinker Biddle[edit]
Frazier started his law career at Drinker Biddle & Reath after graduating from Harvard in Philadelphia.[3] In 1991, Esther Lardent, head of the Death Penalty Representation Project, asked Frazier to defend death row inmate James Willie "Bo" Cochran.[1] Cochran had been arrested and accused of murdering an assistant manager at a Birmingham grocery store in 1976.[6] Frazier, then a partner at Drinker Biddle, and two colleagues took the case.[4] In 1995, after 19 years on death row, the 11th United States Courts of Appeals overturned Cochran's conviction. In 1997, Cochran was retried and found not guilty.[6] Frazier continued to represent him after leaving Drinker Biddle. During Frazier's law career, he also took four summer sabbaticals to teach trial advocacy in South Africa.[2]
Merck & Co.[edit]
As a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, one of Frazier's clients was Merck & Co., the second-largest drug company in the United States.[3][4] In 1992, he joined Merck & Co.'s public affairs division as general counsel.[3][7] Frazier was named senior general counsel in 1999.[8] As general counsel, he was credited with overseeing the company's defense against claims that the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx had caused heart attacks and strokes.[4][8][9] Analysts at the time estimated Merck & Co.'s liability to range from 20 to 50 billion dollars.[10] Frazier said the case was "the most significant challenge [he'd] ever faced."[4] He chose to fight all cases in court rather than settle them all quickly.[7] The remaining cases were settled in 2007 for $4.85 billion.[8]
In 2006, Frazier was promoted to executive vice president in addition to his role as general counsel.[8] He led the company's largest group, human health from 2007 until he was named president of Merck & Co. in April 2010.[3][11] On January 1, 2011 he became CEO and a member of the company's board of directors, replacing former Merck & Co. CEO Richard Clark.[3][12] Frazier was the first African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company.[1]
As CEO, Frazier has directed the company to take financial risks in developing new treatments.[10] In 2013, he prioritized research funding over meeting the year's earnings target.[7] He has placed special emphasis on improving treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Frazier's father died from Alzheimer's. Frazier has said he is also motivated at Merck & Co. by a desire to improve the lives of people in developing countries.[10]
Frazier received a total compensation of $21,387,205 in 2014. According to the "annual collaborative report" from Equilar and The New York Times, Frazier[13] ranked 66th in the May 2015 list of "200 highest-paid CEOs of large publicly traded companies" and seventh in the list of biopharmaceutical executives with the highest total compensation.[14][14]
In July 2016, Frazier sold 60,000 shares of the firm's stock. The stock was sold at an average price of $64.44.[15]
Other work[edit]
On November 11, 2011, as a member of the Penn State board of trustees, the board selected Frazier as chairman of a commission empaneled to investigate a child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and allegations of a cover up by university officials.[16] The commission retained the private law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan as "Special Investigative Counsel" who then hired Pepper Hamilton, legal counsel for Merck & Co.. The report, costing the university $6.5 million, was accepted and used as the basis for the NCAA sanctions against Penn State.[17] Frazier was criticized by attorney William Cluck and other Penn State alumni for his role in the Penn State Board of Trustees' handling of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, particularly its decision to fire head football coach Joe Paterno.[18] Frazier responded to Mr. Cluck with a tirade, saying to the light-skinned Mr. Cluck, "If you cared about that, you are one of the few people in this country that looks like you who actually believes the O.J. Simpson not guilty verdict was correct."[19] Mr. Frazier issued a minimal apology shortly after the event and then, with the benefit of counsel from Merck & Co., a more thorough apology, for the inappropriate outburst.[20]
Frazier is a member of the American Law Institute and serves on its Council. In May 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the ALI Annual Dinner, offering "some reflections on my experiences as a lawyer in private and in-house practice, and from my current vantage point as CEO of a global healthcare company on the importance of our legal system and lawyers for business, for society and for all of our people."[21]

Early life[edit]
Kenneth Frazier was born on December 17, 1954, in North Philadelphia.[1] His father, Otis, was a janitor.[1][2] Frazier has said Thurgood Marshall was one of his heroes growing up.[3] Frazier's mother died when he was twelve years old.[1] He attended Northeast High School. After graduating at age 16, he entered Pennsylvania State University.[3] To make extra money in college, he raised tadpoles and newts and sold them to local stores.[4]
After earning his B.A. from Penn State, Frazier enrolled at Harvard University to study law.[5] He graduated in 1978 with a J.D.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Drinker Biddle[edit]
Frazier started his law career at Drinker Biddle & Reath after graduating from Harvard in Philadelphia.[3] In 1991, Esther Lardent, head of the Death Penalty Representation Project, asked Frazier to defend death row inmate James Willie "Bo" Cochran.[1] Cochran had been arrested and accused of murdering an assistant manager at a Birmingham grocery store in 1976.[6] Frazier, then a partner at Drinker Biddle, and two colleagues took the case.[4] In 1995, after 19 years on death row, the 11th United States Courts of Appeals overturned Cochran's conviction. In 1997, Cochran was retried and found not guilty.[6] Frazier continued to represent him after leaving Drinker Biddle. During Frazier's law career, he also took four summer sabbaticals to teach trial advocacy in South Africa.[2]
Merck & Co.[edit]
As a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, one of Frazier's clients was Merck & Co., the second-largest drug company in the United States.[3][4] In 1992, he joined Merck & Co.'s public affairs division as general counsel.[3][7] Frazier was named senior general counsel in 1999.[8] As general counsel, he was credited with overseeing the company's defense against claims that the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx had caused heart attacks and strokes.[4][8][9] Analysts at the time estimated Merck & Co.'s liability to range from 20 to 50 billion dollars.[10] Frazier said the case was "the most significant challenge [he'd] ever faced."[4] He chose to fight all cases in court rather than settle them all quickly.[7] The remaining cases were settled in 2007 for $4.85 billion.[8]
In 2006, Frazier was promoted to executive vice president in addition to his role as general counsel.[8] He led the company's largest group, human health from 2007 until he was named president of Merck & Co. in April 2010.[3][11] On January 1, 2011 he became CEO and a member of the company's board of directors, replacing former Merck & Co. CEO Richard Clark.[3][12] Frazier was the first African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company.[1]
As CEO, Frazier has directed the company to take financial risks in developing new treatments.[10] In 2013, he prioritized research funding over meeting the year's earnings target.[7] He has placed special emphasis on improving treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Frazier's father died from Alzheimer's. Frazier has said he is also motivated at Merck & Co. by a desire to improve the lives of people in developing countries.[10]
Frazier received a total compensation of $21,387,205 in 2014. According to the "annual collaborative report" from Equilar and The New York Times, Frazier[13] ranked 66th in the May 2015 list of "200 highest-paid CEOs of large publicly traded companies" and seventh in the list of biopharmaceutical executives with the highest total compensation.[14][14]
In July 2016, Frazier sold 60,000 shares of the firm's stock. The stock was sold at an average price of $64.44.[15]
Other work[edit]
On November 11, 2011, as a member of the Penn State board of trustees, the board selected Frazier as chairman of a commission empaneled to investigate a child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and allegations of a cover up by university officials.[16] The commission retained the private law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan as "Special Investigative Counsel" who then hired Pepper Hamilton, legal counsel for Merck & Co.. The report, costing the university $6.5 million, was accepted and used as the basis for the NCAA sanctions against Penn State.[17] Frazier was criticized by attorney William Cluck and other Penn State alumni for his role in the Penn State Board of Trustees' handling of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, particularly its decision to fire head football coach Joe Paterno.[18] Frazier responded to Mr. Cluck with a tirade, saying to the light-skinned Mr. Cluck, "If you cared about that, you are one of the few people in this country that looks like you who actually believes the O.J. Simpson not guilty verdict was correct."[19] Mr. Frazier issued a minimal apology shortly after the event and then, with the benefit of counsel from Merck & Co., a more thorough apology, for the inappropriate outburst.[20]
Frazier is a member of the American Law Institute and serves on its Council. In May 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the ALI Annual Dinner, offering "some reflections on my experiences as a lawyer in private and in-house practice, and from my current vantage point as CEO of a global healthcare company on the importance of our legal system and lawyers for business, for society and for all of our people."[21]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
