					Full Description



Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc., formerly Bacterin International Holdings, Inc., incorporated on August 8, 2006, develops, manufactures and markets regenerative medicine products and medical devices for domestic and international markets. The Company operates through the development, manufacture and marketing of regenerative medical products and devices segment. Its biomaterial products include OsteoSponge, OsteoSponge SC, OsteoSelect DBM putty, OsteoSelect Plus DBM putty, OsteoWrap, BacFast HD, OsteoSTX, hMatrix and a range of 3Demin products, as well as other allografts. The Company's products serve the needs of orthopedic and neurological surgeons, including orthobiologics for the promotion of bone healing, implants and instrumentation for the treatment of spinal disease, tissue grafts for the treatment of orthopedic disorders, and biologics to promote healing following cranial, foot and ankle surgeries.The Company also processes and distributes sports allografts, which are processed for anterior and posterior cruciate ligament repairs, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and meniscal repair; milled spinal allografts, which consists of cortical bone milled to desired shapes and dimensions, and allografts for multi-disciplinary applications, including orthopedics, neurology, podiatry, oral/maxillofacial, genitourinary and plastic/reconstructive. In the fixation portfolio, there are various product families that are used to treat a range of spinal and sacroiliac conditions, including trauma, degeneration, deformity and tumor, with a focus on minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Its product lines include Axle Interspinous Fusion System, Silex Sacroiliac Joint Fusion System, Xpress Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw System, Certex Spinal Fixation System, Butrex Anterior Lumbar Buttress Plating System, Calix, Spider Cervical Plating System, Zyfix Facet Fusion System, Fixcet Spinal Facet Screw System, Fortex Pedicle Screw System, X90 Pedicle Screw System, Irix-A Lumbar Integrated Fusion System, Irix-C Cervical Integrated Fusion System, Axle-X Interspinous Fusion System, and X-PORT tissue-sparing instrumentation system.The OsteoSponge is a form of demineralized bone matrix made from 100% human bone. Derived from trabecular (cancellous) bone, OsteoSponge provides a natural scaffold for cellular in-growth and exposes bone-forming proteins to the healing environment. OsteoSponge are used in various orthopedic practices, including spine, neurology, cranial/maxillofacial, trauma, plastic/reconstruction and general procedures where new bone growth is needed. OsteoSponge SC is a form of OsteoSponge designed to fill bony defects in the subchondral region of joints. OsteoSelect PLUS is indicated as a bone void filler and bone graft substitute in the pelvis, extremities and posterolateral spine. OsteoWrap has various applications in orthopedic, neurological, trauma, oral/maxillofacial and reconstructive procedures. OsteoWrap can wrap around non-union fractures to assist with fusion, can act as a biologic plate or can be used in conjunction with a hardware plate system.The BacFast HD facet stabilization dowel is designed with a focus on osteoconductivity and osteoinductive potential. BacFast HD provides the graft with osteoinductive properties. OsteoSTX are demineralized cortical sticks processed from human allograft bone. OsteoSTX are designed for posterolateral spine surgery applications ranging from one-level to multi-level fusions, including scoliosis procedures. hMatrix dermal scaffold is an extension of its biologics technology. hMatrix is an acellular matrix made from donated human dermal tissue that is used to replace a patient's damaged tissue. hMatrix provides a natural collagen tissue scaffold that supports cellular ingrowth, tissue vascularization and regeneration, and reabsorbs into the patient's dermal tissue for a biocompatible, natural repair. 3Demin is a family of allografts that maximizes osteoconductivity and the osteoinductive potential of human bone. Its 3Demin products are hydrated with various biocompatible liquid for various bone grafting applications. It is used in spinal fusion procedures.The Axle Interspinous Fusion System is a modular interspinous device that is matched to the patient's individual anatomy and is available in multiple implantable configurations. The Silex Sacroiliac Joint Fusion System is a sacroiliac fixation system, which compresses across the sacroiliac (SI) joint. The Xpress Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw System combines minimally invasive functionality to the lumbar fixation procedures-pedicle screw fixation. The Certex Spinal Fixation System consists of screws, hooks, rods and cross connectors. Various sizes of these implants are available so that adaptations can be made to take into account pathology and individual patient anatomy. It is intended to promote fusion of the subaxial cervical spine and cervico-thoracic junction (C3-T3 inclusive). The Butrex Anterior Lumbar Buttress Plating System utilizes the Resilient Locking Arm Technology to prevent screw back out. The Butrex System features an all-in-one drill guide with a plate retaining feature to allow for better control during plate placement and to protect adjacent structures.The Calix is a family of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) interbody spacers and precision instruments for both, Cervical and Thoracolumbar applications. Calix PC is a frictional titanium plasma-coated PEEK implants that provide biomechanical performance and end-plate visualization. The Spider Cervical Plating System consists of single step locking with three forms of locking feedback. Self-drilling screws preserve cancellous bone for secure screw purchase. The Zyfix Facet Fusion System is a minimally invasive facet fusion system featuring a hollow fenestrated titanium compression screw for bone graft introduction. It is intended for bilateral, transfacet fixation of the facet joint in order to provide stability for fusion. The Fixcet Spinal Facet Screw System is a percutaneous facet screw system offering dual-compression thread and single-thread screws. It is intended for posterior fixation to the lumbar spine (L1-S1 inclusive). It enables a bilateral, transfacet fixation of the facet joint in order to provide stability for fusion. The Fortex Pedicle Screw System consists of titanium alloy bone screws, rods, cross-connectors and associated instruments. The system is indicated for attachment to the pedicles of the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine. The X90 Pedicle Screw System combines rotary locking technology and biomechanical performance allowing for rod locking. The Pedicle Screw System is designed to avoid the problems of cross threading, head splay, and cap loosening, endemic to cap type pedicle screw systems.The Irix-A Lumbar Integrated Fusion System consists of an integrated titanium ring, surrounded by an outer PEEK ring and three screws. It is intended for spinal fusion procedures at one or two contiguous levels of the lumbosacral spine (L2-S1 inclusive) in skeletally mature patients for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. The Irix-C Cervical Integrated Fusion System consists of an integrated titanium ring, surrounded by an outer PEEK ring and two screws. It is intended for spinal fusion procedures at one level (C3-T1 inclusive) in skeletally mature patients for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. The Axle-X Interspinous Fusion System is an internal fixation device for spinal surgery in the non-cervical spine (T1-S1 inclusive). It is a minimally invasive, modular interspinous fusion system with angled spikes that allows for adequate L5-S1 engagement and other variations in patient anatomy. The Axle-X Interspinous Fusion System is designed to provide spinal stability for lumbar fusion procedures, including the treatment of degenerative disc disease, spinal tumors and trauma. The X-PORT tissue-sparing instrumentation system is designed for surgical access and visualization. An ideal partner to the X-spine Fortex pedicle screw system, the radiolucent X-PORT retractor component is integrated with a siderail mounted flexible arm for localization and stability. The X-PORT system includes integral tissue-sparing instrumentation to allow for compression, distraction and rod placement.The Company competes with NuVasive, RTI Surgical, SeaSpine, Medtronic, OrthoFix, Stryker, Alphatec, Zimmer Biomet, DePuy/Synthes, K2 Medical, Globus Medical, LDR Holding Company, AlloSource, Lifenet Health and MTF.
