	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	(A)


	The condensed balance sheet at April 30, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The interim condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission from the accounts of Arbor Entech Corporation (the Company) without audit; however, in the opinion of management, the information presented reflects all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which are necessary to present fairly the Companys financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. It is recommended that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Companys fiscal year 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed In July 2016 and other financial reports filed by the Company from time to time.





	(B)


	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.





	Use of Estimates





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	ARBOR ENTECH CORPORATION











	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations






	This report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (including any statements regarding the Companys outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond). Any forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include, among other risks and uncertainties, without limitation, the lack of any current business operation, the possible failure to identify a suitable acquisition candidate, and specific risks which may be associated with any new business or acquisition that we may acquire.





	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, could, would, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, projects, predicts, potential and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except as otherwise required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in this report to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any of our forward-looking statements are based. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates






	The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued disclosure guidance for "critical accounting policies." The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.





	Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to these financial statements. Currently, based on the Companys limited activity, we do not believe that there are any accounting policies that require the application of difficult, subjective or complex judgments.





	Historical Background


	 


	Historically, we were a wood products company that had been in business since 1980. Our business fluctuated over the years. We were almost wholly dependent on sales to The Home Depot, Inc. As discussed below in Discontinued Operations, on September 2, 2003, we discontinued our wood products business.


	 


	Currently, we are seeking other business opportunities, but there can be no assurance that such opportunities will be identified, capitalized upon, or result in any profits.





	Results of Operations


	 


	Since we discontinued our wood products business in 2003, we have had no sales revenue, including during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,245 for the quarter ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $2,735 for the comparable prior period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $15,315 for the nine months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $15,393 for the comparable prior period. The changes in selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to changes in professional fees for the respective reporting periods.





	For the quarter ended January 31, 2017, we had a net loss of $2,187 compared to a net loss of $2,672 for the comparable prior period. The change in net loss was primarily due to an increase in professional fees.





	For the nine months ended January 31, 2017, we had a net loss of $15,135 compared to net loss of $15,199 for the comparable prior period.





	Discontinued Operations


	 


	On September 2, 2003, we terminated our business relationship with Home Depot due to increased difficulties in transacting business with such company on a profitable basis. These difficulties included Home Depots prohibition against price increases, despite increases in our costs of production, a diminution in the Home Depot territories to which we were allowed to sell product, and Home Depots demands regarding returns of ordered products that we were unwilling to accede to for economic reasons. The sale of our real estate resulted in a gain of approximately $186,000 for the year ended April 30, 2005.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	At January 31, 2017, we had working capital of $229,339, compared to working capital of $244,474 at April 30, 2016.





	As of January 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $229,339, a decrease of $18,085, compared with our cash on hand at April 30, 2016. Our assets at January 31, 2017 consisted solely of cash.





	Operating activities used $18,085 in cash for the nine months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $15,199 during the comparable prior period.


	 


	Since terminating our wood products business in September 2003, due to limited cash resources and a limited and sporadic trading market for our Common Stock, among other reasons, we have been unable to find a suitable business opportunity or merger candidate. Nevertheless, we continue to seek business opportunities, including potential acquisition candidates.







	During the remainder of fiscal 2017, we do not anticipate that we will incur any capital expenditures.





	We anticipate that our operating activities will generate negative net cash flow during the balance of fiscal 2017. We believe that the cash on hand will be sufficient for meeting our liquidity and capital resource needs for the next year.





	Off-Balance Sheet Transactions


	 


	We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.









	Item3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






	This Item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company, as defined by applicable SEC regulation.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures







	Managements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes or additions to our controls and procedures.





	As of January 31, 2017, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings within the required time period.






	Changes in Internal control Over Financial Reporting.

	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART I












	Item 1. Description of Business







	History






	We are a Delaware corporation organized in 1980 under the name Arbor Energy Corporation. Our name change was effected in 1984.





	Until September 2, 2003, we engaged in the production and wholesale distribution of wood products for home use, principally fireplace wood and garden stakes. Our products were packaged in and distributed from our facility in Little Marsh, Pennsylvania.





	Substantially all of our products were sold to The Home Depot, Inc. for resale at its retail outlets. We informed Home Depot that we would no longer do business with that company due to increased difficulties in transacting business with Home Depot on a profitable basis. We stated to Home Depot that these difficulties included Home Depots prohibition against price increases despite increases in our costs of production, a diminution in the Home Depot territories we were allowed to sell product to, and Home Depots demands regarding returns of ordered products that we were unwilling to accede to for economic reasons. As a result, on September 2, 2003, we discontinued our wood products business.





	We owned 102 acres of property in Little Marsh, Pennsylvania. There was a wood packaging facility located on the property. The facility consisted of an enclosed structure of 17,000 square feet, with a 7,000 foot outdoor overhang and another 10,000 foot outdoor overhang. Approximately 12 acres of the property were devoted to our work area and the remaining 90 acres was forest land. The real property was mortgaged to Mark Shefts, who was then an officer, director and major stockholder, in consideration of his providing us a credit line of $100,000. We closed on the sale of the property to an unaffiliated party on July 20, 2005 pursuant to a contract entered into in April 2005.





	At present, we are seeking other business opportunities, but we may not be able to identify any such opportunities, and even if we are able to identify other opportunities, we may not be able to capitalize on them or they may not be profitable.





	We currently have no employees. Mr. Brad Houtkin, one of our officers, devotes a small portion of his time to us.






	Current

	 

	Business Strategy






	The Company is seeking one or more potential business opportunities through merger or acquisition or the establishment of a new business. However, due to our limited working capital, it is likely that we will enter into only one business transaction.





	We may also seek to acquire one or more majority and/or wholly owned equity positions in other companies through the direct purchase of stock. Such equity positions will be limited by Section 3(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), in that we will not be permitted to own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of our total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.





	We may provide debt financing to companies in which we have taken (or intend to take) an equity position. Such financing would generally be made on an unsecured basis. In no event will we provide financing for or take equity positions in companies where the aggregate of such investments would cause us to be required to register under the 1940 Act.





	Our present management may or may not become involved as management in the aforementioned business or subsidiary or may hire qualified but as yet unidentified management personnel. There can, however, be no assurance whatsoever that we will be able to acquire a business. A potential acquisition of a business may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. A company that seeks a transaction with us in order to consolidate its operations through a merger, reorganization, asset acquisition, or some other form of combination may desire to do so to avoid what it may deem to be adverse consequences of itself undertaking a public offering. Factors considered may include time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control. In connection with such acquisition, it is possible that an amount of stock constituting control of us would be purchased from us or our current officers, directors and stockholders resulting in substantial profits to such persons without similar profits being realized by other stockholders. Moreover, no assurance can be given with respect to the experience or qualifications of as yet unknown persons who may, in the future, manage our operations and affairs or any business or subsidiary acquired by us. In the event of a change in control of us and our Board of Directors, the payment of any dividends would be wholly dependent upon such persons. Furthermore, it is impossible as yet to determine what, if any, rights applicable state law may provide to our shareholders in any merger or reorganization.






	4










	We may establish or acquire a business and/or invest in one or more new and developing corporations, whether directly or by way of statutory merger, which we believe will offer significant long-term growth potential. In the case of an equity position, we will seek to acquire primarily a majority owned and wholly owned capital stock position in such corporation. We are not restricted to any particular industry and may engage in any line of business. Accordingly, we have broad discretion as to the type of businesses we may acquire and equity investments we may make.





	We assume that any business we acquire or equity investment we make, whether directly or by way of statutory merger, will involve a business that is new and unseasoned, or a business that has been operating for a limited period of time and has a limited or unsuccessful record of revenues or earnings. Investments in start-up enterprises involve a high degree of risk of total loss of investment. Except in cases of a merger or other instances where stockholders approval may be required by applicable law, our stockholders will not have the opportunity to review the relative merits or weaknesses of any proposed business to be acquired or equity investment to be made and, accordingly, will have to rely upon the discretion of our management in selecting a business or investment.





	We have identified certain general policies which we will consider in evaluating business acquisition candidates and investment possibilities. These policies are listed below. In no event will we provide financing or take equity positions in companies where the aggregate of such investments would cause us to be required to register under the 1940 Act.





	1.


	We will examine the products or services of a business being considered to determine whether a market exists for the products or services and whether the business can manufacture and/or market the products or produce the services at a competitive cost.





	2.


	We will invest in a corporation that we believe has a strong potential for growth. We will evaluate the corporations business and determine the quality and experience of its management.





	3.


	We may invest in an operating corporation that has experienced increases in gross revenues which exceed industry averages. The market for the corporations products will be evaluated by determining the relationship of size, growth potential and competitive factors in that corporations industry. This may include the purchase of businesses which offer opportunities for consolidation.





	4.


	We will also consider the following factors:





	(a)


	 Special risks associated with the business and the industry,





	(b)


	Equity available to the business,





	(c)


	Capital requirements of the business,





	(d)


	Potential for profitability and





	(e)


	The effect of market and economic conditions and governmental policies on the business and its products.





	It is unlikely that any one prospective corporation with which we may seek to enter a relationship will conform in all respects to the policies described above. Accordingly, this description is intended to serve only as a general guide for our projected investment activities. These policies are not fundamental policies and may be changed at any time by our Board of Directors.





	We anticipate that we will be brought into contact with a prospective business acquisition or equity investment primarily through the efforts of its officers, directors and principal stockholders who in the course of their business activities frequently come into contact with corporations whose products, services or concepts may be subject to successful development and marketing. In such connection, we may pay a bonus to such officers, directors, principal stockholders or their affiliates. Any such payment would not be higher than that which would ordinarily be paid to a non-affiliated person.





	We do not have any contracts or commitments with anyone or any firm with regard to these business activities. We also do not have any arrangements or understandings with respect to the acquisition of any business entity or the acquisition of any interest therein.





	We may use independent consultants (who may agree to receive our stock in payment for their services in lieu of cash) to explore areas of, and to seek out, acquisition prospects. Such independent consultants would be expected to have such expertise or knowledge which would be of use to us in any investment decision. We have not engaged any independent consultants for the past three years.






	5










	At this time, we believe that any equity investments will be made in private transactions with privately owned corporations. Securities acquired in this manner are restricted from public sale unless they are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or unless an exemption from registration is available.






	Government Regulation






	We may be subject to government regulations promulgated by various local, state and Federal government agencies with regard to its proposed business. Additionally, if we purchase equity positions, we will be subject to various rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the various state securities commissions. We do not intend to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities or otherwise engaging in activities which would render us an investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.





	Our financing activities will be limited by Section 3(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in that the we will not be permitted to own or propose to acquire investment securities having a total value exceeding 40% of the value of our total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are permitted under Section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act to own or propose to own securities of a majority owned subsidiary which is defined under Section 2(a)(24) of the 1940 Act to mean 50% or more of the outstanding securities of which are owned by us or our majority owned subsidiary. Notwithstanding Section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, we would not be considered an investment company where we are engaged directly or indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary (which is defined to mean at least 95% ownership of the outstanding voting stock), in a business or businesses, other than that of investing, owning, holding or trading in securities.





	In addition to the limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 as mentioned above, there are a number of other provisions of the Federal securities laws which will affect our proposed investments.





	Most, if not all, of the securities which we acquire as equity investments will be restricted securities within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and will not be permitted to be resold without compliance with the Securities Act. The registration of securities owned by us is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process, and we always bear the risk that, because of these delays, we will be unable to resell such securities, or that we will not be able to obtain an attractive price for the securities. It is highly improbable that we would be able to sell any of the securities we acquired.






	Competition






	There are numerous companies seeking business opportunities which are larger, have more experience, and are better financed than we are. We may encounter intense competition from numerous other firms seeking new business opportunities. Any investments we make will entail a high degree of business and financial risk that may result in substantial losses to us.






	Personnel






	Mr. Brad Houtkin, one of our officers, devotes a small portion of his time to our business.









	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments






	None.











	Item 2. Description of Properties






	Our business address to 2295 NW Corporate Bld., Suite 230, Boca Raton, FL 33431. We share office space at this address with companies controlled by our majority shareholder, Brad Houtkin. Currently, we are not paying for the use of the facilities or clerical services required as they are deemed to be minimal at this time.

	PART II












	Item 5. Market for Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.






	Market Information - our common stock is quoted in the over-the-counter market on the Electronic Bulletin Board of the OTC market, under the symbol ARBE.OB. Our stock is not traded or quoted on any automated quotation system. There is no established trading market for our common stock, and there is essentially no trading in our common stock. Quotations for and transactions in our common stock are highly sporadic and such information should not be relied upon as a meaningful indication of the price at which a shareholder could sell our common stock. Accordingly, no price information is being supplied herein.





	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. During the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 no securities were issued by the Company.





	Broker-Dealer Sales of Our Securities - Unless our Common Stock has a market price of at least $5.00 per share, such stock is covered by a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule affects the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of purchasers of our stock to sell their securities in the secondary market.





	The SEC has adopted various rules (Rules) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requiring broker-dealers engaging in certain recommended transactions with their customers in specified equity securities falling within the definition of penny stock (generally non-NASDAQ securities priced below $5 per share) to provide to those customers certain specified information. These SEC Rules were adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (Penny Stock Act).





	As a result of the aforesaid rules regulating penny stocks, the market liquidity for our securities, if any, may be severely and adversely affected by restricting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities in the secondary market.





	Holders  There were approximately 170 holders of record of our common stock as of May 31, 2016, inclusive of those brokerage firms and/or clearing houses holding our securities for their clientele, with each such brokerage house and/or clearing house being considered as one holder. The aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2016 was 7,350,540 shares.





	Dividends  a cash dividend of $.15 per share was declared in April 2004 and paid on May 1, 2004 to all stockholders of record as of March 22, 2004. No other dividends have since been declared on our stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.











	Item 6. Selected Financial Data






	Not applicable.









	Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	Statements contained in this report which are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that involve various important assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. These important factors include, without limitation, competitive factors and pricing pressures, changes in legal and regulatory requirements, technological change or difficulties, and general economic conditions, as well as other risks previously disclosed in our securities filings and press releases.





	These forward-looking statements often can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as believes, anticipates, expects, estimates, plans, may, or similar terms.







	General







	We were a wood products company that had been in business since 1980. Our business fluctuated over the years. We were almost wholly dependent on sales to The Home Depot, Inc. As discussed below in Discontinued Operations, on September 2, 2003, we discontinued our wood products business.





	At present, we are seeking other business opportunities, but we may not be able to identify any such opportunities, and even if we are able to identify other opportunities, we may not be able to capitalize on them or they may not be profitable.






	7












	Fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015







	Since we discontinued our wood products business, there were no sales from continuing operations during the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015.





	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $20,203 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, a change of $73 or 0.0% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $20,130 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. The change in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a change in service fees.





	Interest income for the year ended April 30, 2016 was $255 compared to $265 for the year ended April 30, 2015.





	For 2016, we had net loss of $19,948, as compared to a net loss of $19,865 for the comparable period of the prior year.







	Liquidity and capital resources







	As at April 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $247,424 compared to $264,422 at April 30, 2015. We believe we have adequate working capital to fund our search for a business opportunity for at least the next 12 months.





	Our operating activities used $16,998 in cash during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to $7,665 in cash used during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015.





	Since terminating our wood products business in September 2003, we have been unable to find a suitable business opportunity or merger candidate because of the limited cash resources available to us and the limited and sporadic trading market for our common stock. Nevertheless, we are continuing to explore various business opportunities that may be available to us.





	At the present time, we have no commitments for capital expenditures and do not anticipate making any such expenditure unless and until we establish a business or acquire an operating business.






	Off-Balance Sheet Transactions






	We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates






	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our limited operations are such that application of our accounting policies generally does not require the application of our difficult, subjective or complex judgments. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements included with this Annual Report on Form 10K.









	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






	We have no assets, liabilities, revenue or expenses outside the United States and thus we are not subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Nor are we exposed to changes in interest rates, as we have no long-term debt. We do not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments.









	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.






	The Financial Statements required by Item 8 are set forth


	below:

	REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Arbor EnTech Corporation





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arbor EnTech Corporation (the Company) as of April 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Arbor EnTech Corporation as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	ARBOR ENTECH CORPORATION






	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	NOTE 1 -

	Nature of Business






	Arbor EnTech Corporation (the Company) is a Delaware corporation that engaged in the production and wholesale distribution of wood products for home use, principally fireplace wood and garden stakes. The Companys products were produced, packaged in and distributed from its facility in Little Marsh, Pennsylvania. The products were delivered by independent truckers to customer locations in the Northeastern United States. On September 22, 2003, the Company discontinued its wood products business. The Company is seeking other business opportunities.





	NOTE 2 -

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies







	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.






	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Income Taxes






	The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under such method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect enacted changes in tax law. Future tax benefits attributable to temporary differences are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.






	Income (Loss) Per Common Share






	The computation of earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing income (loss) for the year by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during that period. Since the Company has no common stock equivalents, diluted earnings (loss) per share is the same as basic earnings (loss) per share.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	The fair value of the Companys financial instruments, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their carrying amounts reported due to their short-term nature.






	Concentration of Credit Risk






	The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. At times, such amounts are in excess of the FDIC insurance limits.





	NOTE 3 -

	Income Taxes






	For income tax purposes, the Company has available net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) at April 30, 2016 of approximately $440,000 expiring in various years from 2023 through 2034 to reduce future federal and state taxable income, if any. As management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been established.

	The tax effects of significant items comprising deferred income taxes are as follows:

	The difference in the Federal Statutory Rate of 34% and the state rate of approximately 10% and the Companys effective tax rate of 0% is due to a net operating loss carryforward for federal and state taxes. The Company recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $8,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016.





	The Company is no longer subject to examination by Federal or Pennsylvania State taxing authorities for years prior to April 30, 2012.





	NOTE 4 -

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	Management does not believe there would have been a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards been adopted in the current period.





	NOTE 5 

	Related Party Transactions






	During the year ended April 30, 2016, Houtkin Consulting Corp, owned by Brad Houtkin, CEO paid expenses on the Companys behalf. As of April 30, 2016, the amount owed is $1,450.





	In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014, the Company mistakenly paid out on behalf of a related party $14,000 ($12,200 of which was owed at April 30, 2014), which was repaid by the related party to the Company during the year ended April 30, 2015.

	Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.








	Not applicable.









	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.







	Managements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures.






	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes or additions to our controls and procedures.





	As of April 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings within the required time period.






	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.



	 


	The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	With the participation of our President and Treasurer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016, based on the framework and criteria established in

	Internal Control  Integrated Framework

	, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.





	Based on our assessment of the effectiveness in internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016, we concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.





	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.






	Changes in Internal control Over Financial Reporting.




	 



	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	The following table sets forth certain information concerning our directors and executive officers:

	Secretary and Director






	Sherry Houtkin




	 




	65




	 




	Director










	(1)

	Mr. Houtkin serves as our Principal Executive, Financing and Accounting Officer.





	Each director has been elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or until his earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Officers are elected by the directors at meetings called by the directors for such purpose.






	Brad Houtkin

	has been our President, Treasurer and a Director since December 15, 2008. Mr. Houtkin has also been COO of Houtkin Consulting, Inc., a real estate investment firm, since November, 2004. Prior to that, Mr. Houtkin was an executive officer of All Tech Investment Group, Inc., an investment firm.






	Michael


	Houtkin

	has been our Secretary and a Director since December 15, 2008. Mr. Houtkin understood that he would be appointed Secretary and Director when Brad Houtkin, his brother, acquired control of our common stock in December, 2008. Mr. Houtkin has been President of Plaza Promotions, a sales promotional company, since July 2008, and was Director of Sales for Plaza from July, 2004 until he became President.






	Sherry Houtkin

	has been one of our directors since February 1994. Sherry Houtkin has been employed by Houtkin Consulting Corp., an investment consulting firm, since June 2009. She has not been affiliated or employed by any other company in the last five years.






	Family Relationships






	Brad Houtkin and Michael Houtkin are Sherry Houtkins sons, and Brad and Michael Houtkin are brothers. Our Board members have served as directors due to their 92.5% family control of the Company.






	Lack of Committees and Independent Directors






	Our Board of Directors does not currently have a compensation committee, audit committee or nominating committee. Consequently, we do not have an Audit Committee financial expert. We are not required to have an audit committee. We believe that the cost of having an audit committee and retaining a financial expert at this time is unnecessary and would be prohibitive given our current financial condition.






	Lack of Independent Directors






	Under the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations definition, an independent director means a person other than an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries or any other individuals having a relationship that, in the opinion of the Companys board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of the director. The boards discretion in determining director independence is not completely unfettered. Further, under the NASDAQ definition, an independent director is a person who (1) is not currently (or whose immediate family members are not currently), and has not been over the past three years (or whose immediate family members have not been over the past three years), employed by the company; (2) has not (or whose immediate family members have not) been paid more than $120,000 during the current or past three fiscal years; (3) has not (or whose immediately family has not) been a partner in or controlling shareholder or executive officer of an organization which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in excess of the greater of $200,000 or 5% of that organizations consolidated gross revenues, in any of the most recent three fiscal years; (4) has not (or whose immediate family members have not), over the past three years been employed as an executive officer of a company in which an executive officer of Arbor has served on that companys compensation committee; or (5) is not currently (or whose immediate family members are not currently), and has not been over the past three years (or whose immediate family members have not been over the past three years) a partner of Arbors outside auditor.






	10










	The term Financial Expert is defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, as a person who has the following attributes: an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements; has the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves; experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the companys financial statements, or experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities; an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting; and an understanding of audit committee functions.





	Currently, the Company has no independent directors. The Company may in the future seek to add to the Board an independent director who is a financial expert and at that time, to form an audit committee. In the event an audit committee is established, of which there can be no assurances given, its first responsibility would be to adopt a written charter. Such charter would be expected to include, among other things:





	·


	being directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our independent auditor, which shall report directly to the audit committee, including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditors regarding financial reporting for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work;





	·


	annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of the committees formal charter;





	·


	reviewing the annual audited financial statements with our management and the independent auditors and the adequacy of our internal accounting controls;





	·


	reviewing analyses prepared by our management and independent auditors concerning significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements;





	·


	reviewing the independence of the independent auditors;





	·


	reviewing our auditing and accounting principles and practices with the independent auditors and reviewing major changes to our auditing and accounting principles and practices as suggested by the independent auditor or its management;





	·


	reviewing all related party transactions on an ongoing basis for potential conflict of interest situations; and





	·


	all responsibilities given to the audit committee by virtue of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2002.






	Corporate Governance






	Our business, property and affairs are managed by, or under the direction of, our Board, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our By-Laws. Members of the Board are kept informed of our business through discussions with the Principal Executive Officer and other key members of management, by reviewing materials provided to them by management.





	We intend to review our corporate governance policies and practices by comparing our policies and practices with those suggested by various groups or authorities active in evaluating or setting best practices for corporate governance of public companies. Based on this review, we will adopt, changes that the Board believes are the appropriate corporate governance policies and practices for our Company. We will also adopt changes, as appropriate, to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and subsequent rule changes made by the SEC and any applicable securities exchange.






	Director


	Qualifications


	and Diversity






	In the future, the Board expects to seek independent directors who represent a diversity of backgrounds and experiences that will enhance the quality of the boards deliberations and decisions. Candidates shall have substantial experience with one or more publicly traded companies or shall have achieved a high level of distinction in their chosen fields. The board will be particularly interested in maintaining a mix that includes individuals who are active or retired executive officers and senior executives, particularly those with experience in the finance and capital market industries.






	11










	In evaluating future nominations to the Board of Directors, our Board expects to look for certain personal attributes, such as integrity, ability and willingness to apply sound and independent business judgment, comprehensive understanding of a directors role in corporate governance, availability for meetings and consultation on Company matters, and the willingness to assume and carry out fiduciary responsibilities. Qualified candidates for membership on the Board will be considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin or disability.






	Risk Oversight






	Enterprise risks are identified and prioritized by management and each prioritized risk is assigned to the full board for oversight. These risks include, without limitation, the following:





	Risks and exposures associated with strategic, financial and execution risks and other current matters that may present material risk to our operations, plans, prospects or reputation.





	Risks and exposures associated with financial matters, particularly financial reporting, tax, accounting, disclosure, internal control over financial reporting, financial policies, investment guidelines and credit and liquidity matters.





	Risks and exposures relating to corporate governance; and management and director succession planning.





	Risks and exposures associated with leadership assessment, and compensation programs and arrangements, including incentive plans.






	Board Leadership Structure






	In accordance with the Companys By-Laws, the Chairman of the Board presides at all meetings of the Board. Since the Company does not have a Chairman of the Board, the By-Laws of the Corporation require the President, Brad Houtkin, to serve as the Chairman of the Board and to preside at all meetings. Currently, the offices of President (who serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) are not separated. The Company has no fixed policy with respect to the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is likely in the best interests of the Company.






	Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934






	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Section 16(a)) requires our Directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities (collectively, Section 16 reporting persons), to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our Common Stock and other equity securities. Section 16 reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.





	To our knowledge, based on among other things a review of the copies of any such reports furnished to us, during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, none of the Section 16 reporting persons failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to such fiscal year.






	Code of Ethics






	We have not adopted a code of ethics as of the date hereof because we have had no business operations. We intend to adopt a code of ethics if and when we acquire an operating business.






	Procedures for Security Holders to Nominate Directors






	Our bylaws do not provide a procedure for Stockholders to nominate directors. The Board of Directors does not currently have a standing nominating committee. The Board of Directors currently has the responsibility of selecting individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. Qualifications considered by the Directors in nominating an individual may include, without limitation, independence, integrity, business experience, education, accounting and financial expertise, reputation, civic and community relationships and industry knowledge. In nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board of Directors, the Directors will consider and review an existing directors Board and Committee attendance, performance and length of service.

	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, Director Independence

	.





	There have been no transactions between the Company and its officers and directors, except that in the year ended April 30, 2014, $14,000 (of which $12,200 was owed from a related party at April 30, 2014) was mistakenly paid out on behalf of a related party and repaid to the Company during the year ended April 30, 2015 and during the year ended April 30, 2016, Houtkin Consulting paid expenses of $1,450 on the Companys behalf. Houtkin Consulting is owned by the CEO.





	Since each director of the Company is related to each other, an officer and/or principal stockholder of the Company, the Company lacks independent directors. See Item 10.

	(2)

	There were no tax fees incurred for preparation of our tax returns for 2016 and 2015. Our Board of Directors is solely responsible for the nomination, approval, compensation, evaluation and discharge of the independent public accountants. The independent public accountants report directly to the Board and the Board is responsible for the resolution of disagreements between management and the independent public accountants. Consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, the Board has adopted a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent public accountants. Accordingly, the Board pre-approved all services rendered by our independent public accountants. Our independent public accountants for the current fiscal year have been appointed by the Board.

Buildings, campuses, and infrastructures are some of the resources on which we rely to do our jobs and ultimately accomplish our missions. If it’s your job to ensure those resources remain reliable, efficient, and productive, then you undoubtedly face countless decisions as you work to maintain, improve, and grow those assets. Our job is to help you make informed decisions to plan, design, and manage your assets, via our engineering and consulting services. While our technical capabilities of mechanical, electrical, civil, water, wastewater, environmental, energy, architectural, and structural planning and design are diverse, they are not unique to us. What is unique, however, is how we leverage and combine those capabilities with your input and goals, in order to gain a deep understanding of your situation, spurring ideas that might otherwise have been missed. Combining that with our affinity to dig deeper and deliver options that are honest, understandable, and actionable; gives you the power to make informed and confident choices, rather than being dictated solutions. So welcome; take a look around, and get to know us; check out our services, projects, and helpful resources, and let us know if we can help.

Frankly, we’re happy they go unnoticed by most, because that means they are working and taken for granted. Although ignored by most, that does not mean all. Municipalities, authorities, owners, operators, and regulatory agencies pay very much attention to these systems and plants, because along with providing a critical basic sanitation service, they consume taxpayer resources and impact our natural environment as millions of gallons of wastewater come into and leave the system daily. We also pay attention. Our engineers, environmental scientists, and designers are passionate about wastewater plants and systems and their efficiency and reliability. We couple our passion, knowledge, and experience with owner and operator input; empowering you to make informed decisions with confidence about your wastewater system.  Whether the project is large or small, involving collection, treatment, pumping, compliance, reporting, operations, or a new facility or upgrade, we’ve been there and can help you solve the wastewater problem at hand.  learn more about our wastewater engineering, studies, planning, and design services: collection & conveyance treatment      let's talk wastewater Project funding, system compliance, planning, design, and management - whatever your topic, we're here to help.   contact us  LEARN WASTEWATER We continually upload presentations that we've given on a variety of wastewater topics, from the technical, like nutrient removal, to operational, like budgeting and energy reduction. view presentations       Wastewater  Projects   view all projects »      Replacement WWTP, I&I & Compliance   Schuylkill County, PA    more      Biosolids & Energy Efficiency Upgrades   Frackville, PA    more      WWTP Upgrades   Waymart, PA    more      I&I Investigation & System GIS Mapping   Wayne County, PA    more      Central Heating & Wastewater Energy Audit & Design   Dallas, PA    more      Wastewater Force Main   Reading, PA    more      Wastewater & Stormwater Upgrades   Honesdale, PA    more      Combined Sewer Overflow Elimination   Honesdale, PA    more      Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrades   Womelsdorf, PA    more      Sludge Dewatering and Drying Study & Design   Birdsboro, PA    more      Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) upgrade   Lititz, PA    more              What our clients have to say: View All Testimonials »     “Entech truly understands I&I projects and produces clear and well defined contract documents, that give us a true ‘apples to apples’ comparison and allows us to aggressively to bid our projects.”  — President, Utility Services Group              Get eNews from us:

Simply identifying your deferred maintenance on multi-building campuses can be an arduous challenge, while dealing with day to day operations, not to mention taking maintenance information and creating projects, organizing, prioritizing, budgeting, and reporting progress. To help you make informed decisions when managing your maintenance, our architects, engineers, energy and facility analysts can perform a facility condition assessment for your campus. After the physical walkthrough assessment is finished, projects and costs are developed to remedy deferred maintenance, and identify capital renewal and capital improvement projects. Projects and costs are inputted into our custom FM-Assistant database software, so it can reside in a collaborative, adaptive, cloud arena and serve your budgeting, reporting, and tracking needs as you travel through your capital planning and budgeting cycles.  Typical FCA Survey Components:       MEP     Electrical HVAC Heating & Cooling Plumbing Lighting Fire Protection Infrastructure       ARCHITECTURAL     Interiors Exteriors Foundations Elevators Site Improvements Roofs        understanding & reporting your building and campus metrics  The true power of collecting all of your project data is in communicating it. To receive proper funding, facility managers need to communicate the needs of your campus in a manner that is understandable to other campus leaders and stakeholders. Turning measured quantitative project data into qualitative key performance indicators that predict outcomes and impact your campus goals and vision and truly resonate with leadership.  Facility Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):       Facility Condition Index (FCI) Total Projects per SF (TPSF) FCI / TPSF Matrix 10 year budget projections  Annual renewal costs Projects by category / system Facility age vs FCI Get to good funding      combine and conquer; integrated planning Integrating campus deferred maintenance data with other data silos and plans like energy conservation, sustainability and GHG emissions, space utilization, GIS, utilities, accessibility, security, and others will allow you to see your campus with a new perspective, collaborating and prioritizing projects and outcomes, maximizing opportunities and efficiencies. Our FM-Assistant database platform easily connects and integrates with other data sources, to allow you to make more informed and better decisions.      100's of millions sf assessed Whether you have 50,000 or 50 million SF, we've assessed campuses of all sizes around the world to help get or keep their buildings on track; serving and performing at a high level and supporting your mission and goals.
