  Cablevision refuses to offer Fox in the United States
Preparing for an extended absence of transmission, Cablevision sent an email to customers on Wednesday, where they say they will reimburse the cost USD10 to cover payment for watching the games online through MLB.com.
  Cablevision said earlier in the day I made a new offer to pay the deposit Fox Fox channel 5 in New York and Fox 29 in Philadelphia for a year, although the rate is higher than that paid by other channel in New York.
  The cable operator did not explain how much you are offering to receive My9 in New York and cable channels Fox Business Network, NatGeo Wild and Fox Sports, also involved in the dispute over fees.
  Fox, a unit of News Corp., said the rate was presented as a package deal and called Cablevision's statement as "another in a long line of publicity stunts."
  Last week, the FCC asked both companies to demonstrate that they are negotiating in good faith.
  These negotiations in good faith are required by a law that allows the transmission company to negotiate with cable companies and satellite in order to collect fees for broadcasting television signals, which otherwise are disseminated free of charge to any person that has a suitable antenna.

Bresnan Cablevision purchase by 1.370 million dollars
Cablevision looks to expand U.S. operations through the acquisition of Bresnan Communications for U.S. $ 1.370 million.
Cablevision Systems Corp seeks to expand U.S. operations through the acquisition of Bresnan Communications for U.S. $ 1.370 million. It is planned that the operation was consolidated in late 2010 or early 2011.
With this agreement, Cablevision would gain more than 300,000 subscribers in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Currently, sell video, Internet and telephony services in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Bresnan, whose main shareholder is the private equity firm Providence Equity Partners, will allow Cablevision to focus on the business structure of cable systems.
It is expected that the agreement with Bresnan to close in late 2010 or early 2011. Tom Rutledge, Cablevision's chief operating officer, will oversee the new business.
According to the cable company, Bresnan purchase will be financed using debt and $ 1.000 million capital by 370 million dollars.
Providence Equity Partners, which bought Bresnan 2003 at $ 525 million, the company put on sale in March.

Cablevision Systems Corp. said it will acquire Newsday from Tribune Co. for $ 650 million.
  142fc496eac1104b24ae30fdcb1cffa1
  Cablevision, a cable television company based in Long Island, made the announcement after News Corp., Rupert Murdoch conglomerate, withdrew on Saturday its offer of 580 million dollars for the newspaper based on Long Island. The owner of the New York Daily News Mortimer Zuckerman had also submitted an offer for 580 million dollars.
The deal announced Monday that Newsday will again be owned by businessmen from Long Island. Tribune had been seeking to sell Newsday to ease their financial burden of 8,200 million dollars in incurred last year when it decided to delist from the stock markets.
News Corp. would have faced regulatory obstacles to take over Newsday, since it already owns two television stations in the New York area, as well as the tabloid New York Post, in Manhattan.
Murdoch on Wednesday dismissed these concerns in a conference call with reporters after the earnings report the company.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
