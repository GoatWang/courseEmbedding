Highest paid under 40







18 of 20






                  18. Theresa E. Wagler
                






CFO & EVP
                Steel Dynamics (STLD)Age: 392008 Total compensation*: $1.47 million
                Wagler started as an auditor for Ernest & Young before joining Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Steel Dynamics in 1998. Earlier this year, she was named EVP and is focused on trying to
                quell losses at the third-largest U.S.-based steel maker by strict cost compression.
                
                  The strategy may be working; Steel Dynamics reported earnings of $69 million during the third quarter, after three straight losses.
