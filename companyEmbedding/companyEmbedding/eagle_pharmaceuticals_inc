Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Issues Statement Regarding RYANODEX 
      Application PDUFA Date for Exertional Heat Stroke






July 25, 2017 09:19 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eagle” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: EGRX) 
      today issued a statement that it has not yet received correspondence 
      from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its 505(b)(2) 
      New Drug Application for RYANODEX® (dantrolene sodium) for the treatment 
      of exertional heat stroke. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act 
      (PDUFA), the FDA’s goal is to review 90 percent of NDAs on time. The NDA 
      for RYANODEX was accepted for Priority Review, with review timelines 
      within six months of the NDA submission. The PDUFA date was Sunday, July 
      23, 2017.
    

      Eagle will issue a press release once the FDA has made its determination 
      and communicates with the Company.
    

About Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


      Eagle is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and 
      commercializing injectable products that address the shortcomings, as 
      identified by physicians, pharmacists and other stakeholders, of 
      existing commercially successful injectable products. Eagle’s strategy 
      is to utilize the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Additional 
      information is available on the company’s website at www.eagleus.com.

UPDATE: Eagle Pharma stock plummets 21% on news that heat stroke drug failed to get FDA approval
Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares plummeted 20.6% in heavy afternoon trade Wednesday on news that the company's exertional heat stroke drug failed to receive Food and Drug Administration approval. The FDA asked for another clinical trial on the drug, the company said. Last year, the drug, Ryanodex, was given a priority review designation, which is intended for therapies that would significantly improve safety or effectiveness of a treatment. Eagle Pharma said it is reviewing its options and will evaluate the FDA's response. Exertional heat stroke happens during physical activity due to organ tissues getting overheated, which can cause harm and even death. Eagle Pharma stock has plummeted 37.7% over the last three months to $55.95, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Teva Pharma, Eagle Pharma, Depomed Among Slew Getting Price Haircuts
Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) and Depomed (DEPO) stocks plunged Thursday after a Mizuho analyst slashed her price targets on a slew of drugmakers including No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler cited risky guidance for her price-target cuts on Teva and Depomed stocks. She is more bullish on Dermira (DERM), a skin-care firm, but trimmed her price target on prescription trends in dermatology. Eagle stock,

UPDATE: Eagle Pharma stock plummets 21% on news that heat stroke drug failed to get FDA approval
Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares plummeted 20.6% in heavy afternoon trade Wednesday on news that the company's exertional heat stroke drug failed to receive Food and Drug Administration approval. The FDA asked for another clinical trial on the drug, the company said. Last year, the drug, Ryanodex, was given a priority review designation, which is intended for therapies that would significantly improve safety or effectiveness of a treatment. Eagle Pharma said it is reviewing its options and will evaluate the FDA's response. Exertional heat stroke happens during physical activity due to organ tissues getting overheated, which can cause harm and even death. Eagle Pharma stock has plummeted 37.7% over the last three months to $55.95, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) and Depomed (DEPO) stocks plunged Thursday after a Mizuho analyst slashed her price targets on a slew of drugmakers including No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler cited risky guidance for her price-target cuts on Teva and Depomed stocks. She is more bullish on Dermira (DERM), a skin-care firm, but trimmed her price target on prescription trends in dermatology. Eagle stock,

Eagle Overview


Company Background
Eagle is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing injectable products, primarily in the areas of critical care, orphan diseases, and oncology. Our goal is to provide safer and more convenient solutions for patients and healthcare professionals with optimized formulations. We develop proprietary enhancements to FDA-approved drugs utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. This strategy expedites time for development, FDA review, and approval. We further seek to extend the patent life of our products through orphan drug exclusivity, new intellectual property protection, and/or 3 years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. These last allowances come by way of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch Waxman Act.
Industry Background
Intravenous injection is a preferred drug delivery route for many biopharmaceuticals.2 The reference injectable brands that are the primary focus of the Eagle portfolio have an estimated value of $3.4 billion.1
Furthermore, the United States injectable market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 16.3% due to several factors, including1:

Label expansion for approved products, which increases the patient pool for such products
A pipeline of injectable medications at various stages of clinical development
The increasing incidence of certain diseases that may be treated with injectable medications such as cancer and autoimmune disorders

We estimate that the current annual revenue of the overall U.S. market we target is approximately $4 billion.1 In an attempt to capture a larger share of the overall market, we have begun exploring other product opportunities using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in addition to pursuing label expansions of approved Eagle brands.
The Limitations of In-Market Products
We believe that many injectable products used in acute care settings have suboptimal characteristics. These other products may not fully meet the needs of patients and healthcare professionals.
For instance, some existing drugs may be packaged inefficiently while others come in formulations that require reconstitution or dilution, or are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to prepare. Some drugs risk exposing workers to cytotoxic compounds3 and can result in dosing errors.4 These suboptimal characteristics can lead to wasted quantities of drug,5 inefficiencies in staff time and constrained work flow, reduced shelf life,5 and the need for reconstitution of multiple vials in an emergency situation.6,7
At Eagle, we work diligently to create improved formulations that address these issues.
Our Competitive Strengths
Reformulations that Capitalize on Market Opportunities
Our products have the potential to benefit both patients and healthcare professionals. These reformulations of other injectable drugs could provide improvements including:

Reduced chance of dosing errors through elimination of drug reconstitution4,8
Less drug waste5
Improved safety by reduced exposure to cytotoxic vapors3
Reduced drug infusion time9,10
Less drug volume administered9
Fast reconstitution in emergency situations

Compliance
Eagle is committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and we encourage the reporting of any potential violations.
Eagle maintains several points of contact for reporting violations. All communication channels are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year:

Call the compliance hotline: 855-679-2699 (callers may remain anonymous)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

      Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:EGRX) (“Eagle” or “the Company”) 
      announced today that it has received a Complete Response Letter from the 
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its 505(b)(2) New Drug 
      Application for RYANODEX® (dantrolene sodium) for the treatment of 
      exertional heat stroke (EHS), in conjunction with external cooling 
      methods.
    

      In its letter to Eagle, the FDA has requested that the Company conduct 
      an additional clinical trial for RYANODEX for Exertional Heat Stroke.
    

      “We are reviewing our options and will evaluate the FDA’s response to 
      chart a path forward for RYANODEX for this important indication and 
      life-threatening condition,”said Scott Tarriff, Chief 
      Executive Officer of Eagle.
    

      RYANODEX remains approved for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia in 
      conjunction with appropriate supportive measures, and for the prevention 
      of malignant hyperthermia in patients at high risk.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains forward-looking information within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as 
      amended and other securities laws. Forward-looking statements are 
      statements that are not historical facts. Words such as “will,” “may,” 
      “can,” “could be,” “believe,” “intends,” “anticipate(s),” “plan,” 
      “enables,” “potentially,” “entitles,” and similar expressions are 
      intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements 
      include statements regarding future events including, but not limited 
      to: our confidence in the clinical benefits of RYANODEX; our ability to 
      address the FDA’s Complete Response Letter and to chart a path forward 
      for RYANODEX for EHS; and other factors that are discussed in Eagle’s 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and its 
      other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All of 
      such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of 
      which are difficult to predict and generally beyond Eagle’s control, 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking 
      information and statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to 
      whether Eagle’s management and/or board of directors will be effective 
      in managing Eagle’s business and future growth, whether Eagle will 
      maintain successful compliance with FDA and other governmental 
      regulations applicable to manufacturing facilities, products and/or 
      businesses, as well as the other risks described in Eagle’s filings with 
      the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not 
      to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak 
      only as of the date hereof, and we do not undertake any obligation to 
      revise and disseminate forward-looking statements to reflect events or 
      circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of or 
      non-occurrence of any events.
