About Us



    We believe the traditional mortgage banking system is broken and we want to do things differently.
    We have designed our technology with you in mind, focusing on four key priorities: simplicity, transparency,
    efficiency, and an unbeatable price.
    

    Simply, we believe that the mortgage broker’s best days are ahead and we are committed to providing
    the technology, tools, and resources needed to empower our partners.  We are investing heavily in our
    platforms and processes to enable our mortgage brokers to better compete with banks and large retail lenders.
    

    It is no longer enough to claim superior service, technology, and/or price.  We will demonstrate consistent
    results, proactive communication, transparency, and a disciplined culture on each and every transaction.
    

    Our goal is to allow our partners to focus on what they do best: selling loans and advising
    consumers.  We will do the rest.
    

    Ethos Lending is a private, residential lending company headquartered in San Francisco, California.

WHAT DOES ETHOS LENDING DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?


Why?

                                    Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                                    consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you
                                    how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                                    understand what we do.
                                


What?

                                    The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
                                    have with us. This information can include:
                                    

Social Security Number and Account Balances
Payment History and Credit History
Credit Scores and Income




How?

                                    All financial companies need to share customer personal information to run their
                                    everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies
                                    can share their customer’s personal information; the reasons Ethos Lending LLC
                                    (“Ethos Lending”) chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.

                    I hereby authorize and permit __________ to use my credit card for the purpose of obtaining an appraisal
                    through Ethos Lending LLC.  I do so voluntarily and I understand that I as the cardholder am ultimately

Fenway Summer Mortgage to Merge with Ethos Lending
Lefanowicz to Serve as CEO, Carmel as President
















































WASHINGTON, April 8, 2014 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Today Fenway Summer LLC, a hybrid advisory and venture investment firm, and Ethos Lending LLC, a residential home lender specializing in agency eligible mortgages, announced the combination of their respective mortgage ventures. The new firm, which will operate under the name Ethos Lending, will build a national mortgage origination business focusing on agency mortgages and prime non-qualified mortgages. 
Fenway Summer LLC has been incubating a non-qualified mortgage company alongside other ventures—including a recently announced credit card venture—for several months. 
"Our mission at Fenway Summer is to build great consumer finance businesses," said Raj Date, Managing Partner of Fenway Summer LLC.  "Our mortgage business, together with Ethos, is a terrific first example – a technology-enabled business that will deliver great products to otherwise underserved customers." 
Ethos Lending anticipates beginning to originate agency mortgages in the 2nd quarter of 2014.  By the end of the year, Ethos plans to be one of the first wholesale originators of non-qualified mortgages.  Ethos will offer affordable and accessible mortgage products that are unavailable in the market today, such as interest-only loans under the current conforming balance threshold of $417,000. 
The company's management team, described in greater detail below, is drawn from Fenway Summer and Ethos Lending LLC.    

Raj Date, founder of Fenway Summer and former Deputy Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), will serve as the Chairman of the Board of Ethos Lending.   
Mark Lefanowicz, who has been serving as CEO of Fenway Summer Mortgage, will serve as CEO of Ethos Lending.  Earlier in his career, Mr. Lefanowicz was CFO of Provident Funding and CEO of E-LOAN. 
Adam Carmel, the founder of Ethos Lending LLC, will serve as President of Ethos Lending.  Prior to founding Ethos, Mr. Carmel was an Executive Vice President at Provident Funding, where he managed servicing and sub-servicing operations.  
Kin Chung will be Chief Credit Officer of Ethos Lending. Mr. Chung joined Fenway Summer after holding senior analytics positions at a variety of leading financial firms, including Fannie Mae and Capital One.  He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University. 
Erik Stern will be Chief Operating Officer of Ethos Lending.  Mr. Stern has deep experience in mortgage loan underwriting, funding, servicing, and most other operational aspects of the mortgage wholesale business.  Mr. Stern held numerous management positions at Provident Funding. 
Sean Souther will be Chief Information Officer of Ethos Lending.  Mr. Souther has experience in developing unique and cutting-edge technology solutions in the mortgage business.  Mr. Souther has held senior management technology positions at Fidelity National Lending and Lender Processing Services.  
Chris Haspel will lead Capital Markets for Ethos Lending.  Mr. Haspel has deep capital markets experience, including time in leadership positions at the CFPB, Ginnie Mae, Capital One, BlackRock Financial Management, and GE Capital Mortgage. 
Mitch Hochberg will serve as the General Counsel of Ethos Lending.  Prior to joining Fenway Summer, Mr. Hochberg was a Senior Counsel within the CFPB Office of Regulations.  He spent several years at Cadwalader, Wichersham & Taft LLP, where he was responsible for managing several significant litigations relating to mortgage loan underwriting, servicing, and securitization. 
"I had the opportunity to work with Adam earlier in my career; he is a savvy and disciplined operator and a great fit with our team.  We are very excited about our company's unique ability to offer both agency eligible and non-qualifying mortgages to the mortgage broker community," said Mr. Lefanowicz. 
"Ethos has been hard at work building an efficient and scalable mortgage platform," Mr. Carmel said. "Combining our collective core competencies is an exciting opportunity and I am delighted to be partnering with Fenway Summer."

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Ethos Lending, LLC has received 3.85 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
