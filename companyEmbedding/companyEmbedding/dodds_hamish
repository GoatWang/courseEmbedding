Hamish Dodds, Hard Rock

ORLANDO—Hamish Dodds, president and CEO, Hard Rock Cafe International (USA) Inc., has decided to step down from his position in early 2017 to pursue new opportunities. The company is wholly owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida. It has been led by Dodds since 2004. 
“It has been an absolute privilege working for Hard Rock over the last 13 years and leading the growth of this amazing brand, while helping to reinforce Hard Rock’s unique character, and its commitment to service and philanthropy. Hard Rock is a place where staff are empowered to deliver authentic guest experiences in a rock and roll environment,” said Dodds. “Today, the business is well positioned with a strong brand footprint and an extensive pipeline of projects in all business units. I wish the Seminole Tribe of Florida and all our Hard Rock employees and partners continued success in the future.” 
Jim Allen, chairman of Seminole HR Holdings LLC, the company's parent, said, “We are grateful to Hamish for his leadership and vision. His global perspective was instrumental in the company’s growth. His loyalty and passion are greatly appreciated, and we wish him well in the next stage of his career.” 
During Dodds' tenure, ownership of the company was transferred from the Rank Group in the United Kingdom to the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Dodds was instrumental in both this transition and the transformation of Hard Rock into a global hospitality brand. Hard Rock International operates restaurants, hotels, casinos and live music venues in more than 70 countries. Hard Rock-branded hotel properties have recently been announced in New York, London and Berlin. 
Dodds will help transition the company to new leadership, and will also remain actively associated with Hard Rock’s philanthropic arm, The Hard Rock Heals Foundation.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.
