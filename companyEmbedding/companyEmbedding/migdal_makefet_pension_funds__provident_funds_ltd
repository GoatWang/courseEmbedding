                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  The 2012 Prudential Financial and General Motors $25.1B pension risk transfer transaction was the largest and most complex of its kind by an order of magnitude in the U.S. market and globally. A flawless execution on behalf of 110,000 former plan participants of the legacy GM Retirement Program for Salaried Employees required exceptional teamwork, sophisticated expertise in longevity risk, ALM, investments, pensions, a scalable plan administration infrastructure and relentless dedication to servicing excellence.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

 Recent papers by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL WHY DE-RISK?

Your path to heightened pension certainty may involve multiple phases, and will require careful planning. Your firm and its defined benefit pension plan are as unique as the ultimate de-risking journey you may take.

You may associate de-risking with times of market volatility, but you should know that pension risk transfer strategies designed and executed during periods of relative market stability can offer a prime opportunity to implement strategies to mitigate the risks of defined benefit debt obligations.
It’s time to re-think pension risk, and the time to transfer your plan’s risk is now.
FIVE REASONS TO TRANSFER YOUR PENSION RISK

Ultimately creates greater certainty of corporate cash flows.
Avoids potential funding surplus trap.
Takes advantage of rising funded status window of opportunity.
Timing—it can take many months to execute a pension risk transfer transaction depending on complexity, populations, type of transfer, portfolio allocation, and other factors.
Taps early mover advantages: access to finite insurer capital, operational capacity, and current pricing.

 
YOU MAY BE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK
Funded status is chief among the many factors to consider when determining how and when to de-risk.
In a rising interest rate environment, a plan's funded status can be volatile and windows of opportunity to act can be fleeting. During the first six months of 2013, U.S. corporate DB plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88 percent. Over the course of 2013, U.S. corporate Defined Benefit plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88.3 percent. (Milliman 100 Monthly Pension Funding Index)
Your pension’s funded status may be closer to 100 percent than you think, risking the possibility of trapped assets once you cross the 100 percent funded status threshold. Companies with modest underfunding of, or adequately funded, material pension liabilities are therefore in the prime window of opportunity to focus on de-risking and creating additional financial flexibility. Shifting pension risk to a qualified annuity provider may be more viable than ever. The scenario below illustrates the combination of discount rates and equity returns—and the resulting funded status.

Pension, retirement and study funds solutions
Migdal Makefet is one of the major driving  forces behind expansion of the pension savings sector in Israel, and it is the centre in of influence in the market. Migdal Makefet managed Makefet - Ishit fund – a new  comrehensive pension fund , and the Makefet Mashlima fund – a new general pension fund. Also, Migdal manages various provident funds and advanced study funds.













  
Since Migdal Makefet Pension Funds and Provident Funds Ltd. was established in 1995 it has earned a reputation as being a large, stable, secure, innovative, reliable and leading company. In September 2004, Migdal Makefet was taken over by Migdal Insurance Company Ltd. – the largest life and pensions insurer in Israel.
The acquisition of Migdal Makefet by Migdal Insurance created an optimal synergy of skill and expertise in managing pension, provident and advances study funds with the backing of the largest insurance company in Israel.
At the beginning of 2006, all of the pension funds of the Migdal Group were amalgamated into a single fund. Makefet Personal, Teuzah, Yozma New and Tenufa were all amalgamated into a huge central fund with a diverse and high quality member base – Migdal Makefet Personal.
In 2011 the provident and advanced study fund management companies – Migdal Provident Fund Management Ltd., New Makefet Provident Fund Management Ltd. and Migdal Platinum Provident Fund Ltd, were amalgamated into Migdal Makefet Pension Funds and Provident Funds Ltd. Following the amalgamation, Migdal Makefet became the management entity of all pension funds and provident funds in the Migdal Group.
In January 2014 the provident funds and advanced study funds detailed in the following link were amalgamated. 
Following these amalgamations Migdal Makefet has a single advanced study fund: Migdal Advanced Study (compromised of 11 investment funds), a severance pay provident fund: Migdal Severance Pay Provident (comprised of 8 investment funds), a provident fund for sick pay: Makefet Sick Pay, a Central Budgetary Pension Fund: Migdal Budgetary, and a central provident fund for severance pay: Migdal Central Severance Pay.
Product diversity
Migdal Makefet offers a diverse range of products: a new comprehensive pension fund, a new general pension fund, a non-annuity paying provident fund, an advanced study funds, a central sick pay fund, a central budgetary fund and a central severance pay fund; thereby enabling us to provide our customers with optimal solutions tailored to their individual needs and preferences.

Migdal Makefet Personal is the second largest pension fund in Israel, providing unsurpassed stability, security and strength. The fund manages assets of approx. NIS 43.5 billion (approx. US$ 10 billion) for some 800,000 members (as of 31.12.2014). Contributions into the fund in 2014 reached NIS 5.2 billion.
Customer base
The security and strength of each pension fund, which by definition involves long-term savings, depends not only on the number of members but also on the profile of the members. The competitive advantage of Migdal Makefet has made it the preferred choice for a wide range of corporations, public entities and enterprises in various sectors, and over the years Migdal Makefet has built up a diverse and high quality customer base from some of the top companies in Israel.
Migdal Advanced Study is the largest fund of its type in Israel and manages assets of approx. NIS 13.5 billion (as of 31.12.2014).

Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”) and Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, for the entry of an Order: (1) appointing the Perrigo Institutional Investor 
Group as Lead Plaintiff; (2) approving Lead Plaintiff’s selection of Pomerantz LLP 
(“Pomerantz”) and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP (“Bernstein Litowitz”) as Co-
Lead Counsel; and (3) granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and 
proper. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The above-captioned action (the “Action”) alleges that from April 21, 2015 to May 11, 
2016, inclusive (the “Class Period”), Perrigo Company plc (“Perrigo” or the “Company”) and 
its former Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Papa (collectively, “Defendants”), defrauded 
investors in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 
78t(a)), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (17 
C.F.R. § 240.10b-5). The Action also alleges that Defendants defrauded investors that held 
shares of Perrigo as of 8:00 am on November 13, 2015 in violation of Section 14(e) of the 
Exchange Act in connection with a tender offer made by Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”). Perrigo 
investors, including the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group, incurred significant losses 
following the disclosure that Perrigo was experiencing significant competitive pressures, as well Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 6 of 20 PageID: 189
{00208703;3 } 2 as problems integrating recently acquired Omega Pharma N.V. (“Omega”), which resulted in 
the Company taking impairment charges totaling over $650 million. 
Pursuant to the PSLRA, the court is to appoint as lead plaintiff the movant or group of 
movants that possesses the largest financial interest in the outcome of the action and that 
satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-
4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I). The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group—with losses of approximately 
$68,161,974 calculated on a FIFO basis and $60,263,905 calculated on a LIFO basis in 
connection with its purchases of U.S.-traded Perrigo securities during the Class Period, and 
losses of approximately $54,761,574 in connection with the 846,347 shares it held as of the date 
of Mylan’s failed tender offer for Perrigo shares—is believed to have the largest financial 
interest in the relief sought in this action.
1

In addition to asserting the largest financial interest in this litigation, the Perrigo 
Institutional Investor Group also meets the applicable requirements of Rule 23 because its 
claims are typical of absent class members and because it will fairly and adequately represent 
the interests of the Class. The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group is a paradigmatic Lead 
Plaintiff under the PSLRA because it is a small group of sophisticated institutional investors 
with a real financial interest in the litigation. Accordingly, the Perrigo Institutional Investor 
Group has both the incentive and ability to supervise and monitor counsel. 
Further, as set forth in greater detail in their Joint Declaration submitted herewith, the 
Perrigo Institutional Investor Group fully understands the Lead Plaintiff’s obligations to the 
Class under the PSLRA, and is willing and able to undertake the responsibilities of the Lead 
Plaintiff to ensure the vigorous prosecution of this action.

{00208703;3 } 3 Lead Plaintiff, representatives from the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group held a joint 
conference call to discuss the merits of the claims against Defendants, as well as the funds’ 
common goals in the litigation. 
The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group has also demonstrated its adequacy through its 
selection of Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz as proposed Co-Lead Counsel for the Class. 
Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz are nationally recognized securities class action firms that 
have each recovered billions of dollars for the benefit of harmed investors. The Perrigo 
Institutional Investor Group also selected the highly respected firm of Lowenstein Sandler LLP 
(“Lowenstein Sandler”) to serve as liaison counsel for the Class. 
Accordingly, based on the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group’s significant financial 
interest and its commitment and ability to jointly oversee this action in a cohesive and 
coordinated fashion, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group respectfully requests that the Court 
appoint it as Lead Plaintiff and otherwise grant its motion. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
Perrigo manufactures generic drugs and other over-the-counter (“OTC”) medications. 
On April 8, 2015, competing drug manufacturer Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”) approached the Perrigo 
Board of Directors with an offer to purchase Perrigo for $205 per share, representing a nearly 
30% premium to the Company’s total market capitalization. Mylan’s approach was well 
received by investors, and the price of Perrigo stock climbed as high as $215 per share in 
intraday trading on April 8. 
However, on April 21, 2015, the first day of the Class Period, Perrigo publicly rejected 
Mylan’s offer and falsely told investors that it “substantially undervalues Perrigo and its growth 
prospects,” and that the offer “does not take into account the full benefits of the Omega Pharma 
acquisition.” Even though Mylan subsequently raised its offer to approximately $235 per share, 
over the next six months, Perrigo continued to engage in a public campaign to convince 
shareholders to reject Mylan’s proposal. As additional reasons to reject Mylan’s offer, Perrigo Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 8 of 20 PageID: 191
{00208703;3 } 4 cited the 5%-10% in organic revenue growth that it would achieve as a standalone company, as 
well as significant synergies from Perrigo’s March 2015 acquisition of Omega, among other 
things. 
These statements—which caused a majority of Perrigo’s shareholders to reject Mylan’s 
offer—were materially false and misleading. In truth, Perrigo knew or recklessly disregarded 
that: (1) Mylan’s offer did not undervalue Perrigo; (2) Perrigo would not be able to achieve 5%-
10% organic growth as a standalone company; (3) the Company’s “durable competitive position 
and durable growth strategy” was rapidly deteriorating; and (4) Perrigo was experiencing serious 
issues integrating the Omega acquisition and significantly overpaid for Omega’s business. 
Convinced by Perrigo’s strong opposition to Mylan’s tender offer, on November 13, 2015, 
the majority of the Company’s shareholders declined to tender their shares making the tender 
offer a failure and causing the price of Perrigo shares to decline by 6% from $156.55 per share to 
$146.90 per share. 
On February 18, 2016, Perrigo reported fourth quarter 2015 revenue, margins, earnings, 
and cash flow that were all lower than investors had been led to expect, and decreased earnings 
guidance for 2016. The Company also announced the sudden need to restructure parts of the 
Omega business, and that it would need to take a $185 million impairment charge related to 
Omega’s assets. As a result of these disclosures, Perrigo shares fell $14.77 per share, or 10%, to 
close at $130.40 per share. 
Then, on April 22, 2016, Reuters reported that Perrigo’s longtime CEO would be 
appointed as the new CEO of competing pharmaceutical company Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The 
news that CEO Papa would be leaving Perrigo after spending the better part of the prior year 
assuring investors of the strength of Perrigo’s business caused the price of the Company’s shares 
to fall from $128.68 per share to $121.35 per share, or almost 6%. 
On April 25, 2016, before the market opened, Perrigo confirmed that CEO Papa was, in 
fact, resigning to become Valeant’s new CEO. The Company also drastically lowered its earnings 
guidance for 2016 and announced week preliminary first-quarter 2016 results. The Company Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 9 of 20 PageID: 192
{00208703;3 } 5 attributed its poor financial performance to increased competitive pressures and weaker than 
expected performance within Omega. Finally, Perrigo disclosed issues with the integration of 
Omega, and that it was contemplating another impairment charge—in addition to the $185 million 
charge the Company took just two months prior—associated with the Omega acquisition. This 
news cause the price of Perrigo shares to fall an additional $21.95 per share, or 18%, from 
$121.35 per share to $99.40 per share. 
On May 12, 2016, Perrigo announced a first quarter net loss of $0.93 per share, which the 
Company largely attributed to an additional $467 million impairment charge relating to the 
Omega acquisition. Following the announcement of Perrigo’s financial results, the Company’s 
newly appointed CEO—John Hendrickson—stated that he would be targeting “realistic” forecasts 
the Company can meet—a clear admission that the Company had previously asserted unrealistic 
and unattainable financial goals in an effort to defeat Mylan’s takeover during the prior year. As 
a result of these disclosures, Perrigo shares fell $3.71 per share, or 4%. 
As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the 
market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered 
significant losses and damages. 
ARGUMENT 
I. THE PERRIGO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR GROUP SHOULD BE 
APPOINTED LEAD PLAINTIFF 
The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group should be appointed Lead Plaintiff because it is 
believed to have the largest financial interest in the Action and otherwise meets the requirements 
of Rule 23. The PSLRA directs courts to consider any motion to serve as lead plaintiff filed by 
class members in response to a published notice of the class action by the later of (i) 90 days 
after the date of publication, or (ii) as soon as practicable after the Court decides any pending 
motion to consolidate. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i) & (ii). 
Further, under 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I), the Court is directed to consider all 
motions by plaintiffs or purported class members to appoint lead plaintiff filed in response to any Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 10 of 20 PageID: 193
{00208703;3 } 6 such notice. Specifically, the Court “shall” appoint “the presumptively most adequate plaintiff” 
to serve as lead plaintiff and shall presume that plaintiff is the person or group of persons, that: 
(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to 
a notice . . .; 
(bb) in the determination of the Court, has the largest financial 
interest in the relief sought by the class; and 
(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. 
15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I). 
As set forth below, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group satisfies all three of these 
criteria and thus is entitled to the presumption that it is the most adequate plaintiff of the Class 
and, therefore, should be appointed Lead Plaintiff for the Class. 
A. The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group is Willing to Serve as Class 
Representative 
On May 18, 2016, Bernstein Litowitz, as counsel for plaintiff in the above-captioned 
action, caused a notice to be published over PR Newswire pursuant to Section 21D(a)(3)(A)(i) of 
the PSLRA, which announced that the Action had been filed against Defendants, and advised 
investors in Perrigo securities that they had until July 18, 2016 to file a motion to be appointed as 
Lead Plaintiff. (See Lieberman Decl., Ex. A.) The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group has filed 
the instant motion pursuant to the Notice, and has attached Certifications attesting that its 
members are willing to serve as representatives for the Class, and provide testimony at 
deposition and trial, if necessary. (See id., Ex. B.) Accordingly, the Perrigo Institutional 
Investor Group satisfies the first requirement to serve as Lead Plaintiff of the Class. 
B. The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group Has the “Largest Financial 
Interest” 
The PSLRA requires a court to adopt a presumption that “the most adequate plaintiff . . . 
is the person or group of persons that . . . has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by 
the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii). To the best of the Perrigo Institutional Investor 
Group’s knowledge, it has the largest financial interest of Perrigo investor seeking to serve as Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 11 of 20 PageID: 194
{00208703;3 } 7 Lead Plaintiff. For claims arising under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, courts frequently 
assess financial interest based upon the four factors articulated in the seminal case Lax v. First 
Merchants Acceptance Corp., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11866, at *7-*8 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 6, 1997). 
Those factors are: (1) the number of shares purchased during the class period; (2) the number of 
net shares purchased during the class period; (3) the total net funds expended during the class 
period; and (4) the approximate losses suffered. See id; see also In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 
F.3d 201, 262 (3d Cir. 2001) (adopting test set forth in Lax v. First Merch. Acceptance Corp).

During the Class Period, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group: (1) purchased 
1,548,573 shares of Perrigo stock; (2) purchased 1,169,930 net shares of Perrigo stock; (3) 
expended $232,598,156 on its purchases of Perrigo shares; and (4) incurred losses of 
$68,161,974 calculated on a FIFO basis and $60,263,905 calculated on a LIFO basis on its 
transactions in Perrigo shares during the Class Period. (See Lieberman Decl., Ex. C.) Moreover, 
with regard to claims arising under Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, the Institutional Investor 
Group incurred losses of $54,761,574 on the 846,347 Perrigo shares the Group held as of 8:00 
am on November 13, 2015, the date of the failed tender offer.
4
(Id.) Because the Perrigo 
Institutional Investor Group possesses the largest financial interest in the outcome of this 
litigation, it is the presumptive “most adequate” plaintiff. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(bb). 
C. The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group Otherwise Satisfies the 
Requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
The PSLRA further provides that, in addition to possessing the largest financial interest 
in the outcome of the litigation, the Lead Plaintiff must “otherwise satisfy the requirements of 
Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”

2007) (collectively, the “Lax-Olsten” factors).

Under Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, the Group’s damages on shares held at the date of 
Mylan’s tender offer were calculated as the difference between $174.36 per share (the value of 
the tender offer) and the disposition price of the shares (either (a) the higher of the actual sales 
price or the average price over the 90 preceding trading days; or (b) the hold price for retained 
shares). Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 12 of 20 PageID: 195
{00208703;3 } 8 In making its determination that Lead Plaintiff satisfies the requirements of Rule 23, the 
Court need not raise its inquiry to the level required in ruling on a motion for class certification. 
Instead a prima facie showing that the movant satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements 
of Rule 23 is sufficient. See In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 264 (“[Tt’s initial inquiry as to 
whether the movant with the largest losses satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements 
need not be extensive.”). 
Typicality can be established by showing that the proposed class representative’s 
individual circumstances and legal theories upon which the claims are based are not markedly 
different from those of other class members. See In re Molson Coors Brewing Co. Sec. Litig., 
233 F.R.D. 147, 152 (D. Del. 2005) (“[Ts not require that all putative class 
members share identical claims.”) (quoting In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 
531-32 (3d Cir. 2004)). 
The claims of the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group are typical of those of the Class. 
The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group alleges, as do all class members, that Defendants 
violated the Exchange Act by making what they knew or should have known were false or 
misleading statements of material facts concerning Perrigo, or omitted material facts necessary to 
make the statements they did make not misleading. The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group, 
like all members of the Class, purchased Perrigo securities during the Class Period at prices 
artificially inflated by defendants’ misrepresentations or omissions, and held shares at the point 
of the tender offer, and was damaged when the tender offer failed and upon the disclosure of 
those misrepresentations. These shared claims, which are based on the same legal theory and 
arise from the same events and course of conduct as the Class claims, satisfy the typicality 
requirement of Rule 23(a)(3). 
The adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) is satisfied where it is established that a 
representative party “will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” In order for the 
Class’ interests to be fairly and adequately represented, a Lead Plaintiff must demonstrate that it 
“has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously,” has “obtained Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 13 of 20 PageID: 196
{00208703;3 } 9 adequate counsel,” and its interests are sufficiently aligned with those of absent Class members. 
In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 265 (citations omitted). The Perrigo Institutional Investor Group is an 
adequate representative for the Class. There is no antagonism between the interests of the Perrigo 
Institutional Investor Group and those of the Class, and its losses demonstrate that it has a 
sufficient interest in the outcome of this litigation. 
Moreover, as set forth in greater detail below, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group has 
retained counsel highly experienced in vigorously and efficiently prosecuting securities class 
actions such as this action, and submits its choice to the Court for approval pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 
§ 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(v). 
II. AGGREGATION OF THE PERRIGO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR 
GROUP’S FINANCIAL INTERESTS IS APPROPRIATE 
The appointment of a group of Class members as Lead Plaintiff is expressly permitted by 
the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I), and the Third Circuit, as well as district courts 
within the Third Circuit—including this Court—which have repeatedly recognized the propriety 
of appointing such groups that are capable of “fairly and adequately protect[ing 
the class.” In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 266 (“The statute contains no requirement mandating that 
the members of a proper group be ‘related’ in some manner; it requires only that any such group 
‘fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.’”); In re Enzymotec Ltd. Sec. Litig., 2015 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25720 (D.N.J. Mar. 3, 2015) (Arleo, J.) (appointing as Lead Plaintiff group of 
three investors); OFI Risk Arbitrages v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, 63 F. Supp. 3d at 411 
(D.Del. August 6, 2014) (appointing as Lead Plaintiff group of institutional investors). 
Migdal Insurance owns Migdal Makefet and manages nearly $50 billion in assets. (See 
Lieberman Decl., Ex. D, ¶ 2.) Each of the Migdal entities is the beneficial owner of the 
securities described in its Certification. Aasaf Shoham, Deputy CEO of Migdal Insurance, with 
authority to bind Migdal Insurance and enter into litigation on its behalf, signed a Certification 
on behalf of Migdal Insurance. (See id., Exs. B, D.) Ofer Eliahu, CEO of Migdal Makefet, with Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 14 of 20 PageID: 197
{00208703;3 } 10 authority to bind Migdal Makefet and enter into litigation on its behalf, signed a Certification on 
behalf of Migdal Makefet. (See id.) 
Meitav is an affiliate of Meitav Dash, a leading investment management firm in Israel 
with approximately $36.3 billion under management. (See id. Ex. D, ¶ 4.) Meitav is the 
beneficial owner of the securities described in its Certification. Teddy Lin, Meitav Dash’s CEO, 
with authority to bind Meitav and enter into litigation on its behalf, signed a Certification on 
behalf of Meitav. (See id.) 
The Canaf-Clal entities are affiliates of Canaf-Clal Financial Management Ltd., the 
investment arm of Israel’s Clal Group, with total assets under management of nearly $39 billion. 
(See id. Ex. D, ¶ 3.) Anath Levin, CEO of Canaf-Clal Financial Management Ltd., with 
authority to bind the Canaf-Clal entities and enter into litigation on their behalf, signed a 
Certification on behalf of Canaf-Clal. (See id. Exs. B, D.) 
As set forth in their Joint Declaration, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group has 
demonstrated its commitment to working cohesively as a group in the prosecution of this action. 
(See id. Ex. D); see also W. Palm Beach Police Pension Fund v. DFC Global Corp., No. 13-
6731, 2014 WL 1395059, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 10, 2014) (appointing group and noting 
“declaration lay[ingtions of” the group’s members). Indeed, the 
Perrigo Institutional Investor Group is comprised of a small, cohesive partnership of 
sophisticated institutional investors that determined on their own to jointly seek appointment as 
Lead Plaintiff. (See Lieberman Decl., Ex. D); see also DFC Global Corp., 2014 WL 1395059, at 
*7-9 (appointing group after concluding that group was capable of “fairly and adequately 
protect[ingsts of the class”); La. Mun. Police Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. Green Mountain 
Coffee Roasters, Inc., No. 2:11-cv-289, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89192, at *11 (D. Vt. Apr. 27, 
2012) (finding joint declaration “sufficient to assure the Court that the [lead
effectively manage the litigation”). 
The Joint Declaration also sets forth the reasons why these investors are collaborating in 
this litigation and establishes how the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group intends to oversee Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 15 of 20 PageID: 198
{00208703;3 } 11 counsel and this litigation. (See Lieberman Decl., Ex. D, ¶¶ 1, 5-9.) As reflected in the Joint 
Declaration, before seeking appointment as Lead Plaintiff, representatives of each fund in the 
Perrigo Institutional Investor Group discussed together, among other things: the strength of the 
claims against Defendants; a strategy for prosecuting these actions; the benefits that the class 
would receive from the leadership of a coordinated group of institutional investors with prior 
experience serving as Lead Plaintiff under the PSLRA; the shared desire of Migdal, Canaf-Clal, 
and Meitav to achieve the best possible result for the class; the interests in prosecuting the case 
in a collaborative, likeminded manner; and the actions each fund will take to continue to ensure 
that the class’s claims will be zealously and efficiently litigated. (See id.) 
Drawing upon their collective resources and experience, the Perrigo Institutional Investor 
Group is well-suited for this litigation and would advance the interests of the Class. Each 
member of the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group is a sophisticated institutional investor, and 
Canaf-Clal and Meitav each has highly relevant experience serving as part of Lead Plaintiff 
groups under the PSLRA. (See id. ¶¶ 3, 4, 6.) Indeed, both Canaf-Clal and Meitav have prior 
experience serving as Lead or Co-Lead Plaintiffs in securities class actions, having previously 
represented the interests of investors in In re Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. Securities Litigation, 
13-cv-00925 (S.D.N.Y.) and In re Sanofi Securities Litigation, 14-cv-9624 (S.D.N.Y.), 
respectively. (See id.) 
The evidence submitted by the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group demonstrating its 
commitment to vigorously and effectively representing the interests of the Class as members of a 
Lead Plaintiff group is more than adequate to satisfy the adequacy and typicality requirements. 
See, e.g., In re Bank of Am. Corp. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 258 F.R.D. 260, 270 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding that “demonstrated cooperation among plaintiffs [through discussions 
and declarations memorializing their joint oversight over counsel and the action], particularly 
plaintiffs that are sophisticated institutional investors, satisfies concerns about designating 
groups as lead plaintiffs that are in fact dominated by counsel”). Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 16 of 20 PageID: 199
{00208703;3 } 12 III. LEAD PLAINTIFF’S SELECTION OF COUNSEL SHOULD BE 
APPROVED 
The PSLRA vests authority in the Lead Plaintiff to select and retain lead counsel, subject 
to the approval of the Court. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(v). The Court should interfere with 
Lead Plaintiff’s selection only when necessary “to protect the interests of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 
78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II)(aa); see also In re Molson Coors, 233 F.R.D. at 150 (“Once the lead 
plaintiff is chosen, that party is primarily responsible for selecting lead counsel.”). 
Here, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group has selected Pomerantz and Bernstein 
Litowitz as Co-Lead Counsel for the Class. These firms are highly experienced in the area of 
securities litigation and class actions, and have successfully prosecuted numerous securities 
litigations and securities fraud class actions on behalf of investors, as detailed in the firms’ 
respective resumes. (See Lieberman Decl., Exs. E-F.) 
Pomerantz is a premiere firm in the area of securities litigation. For more than 75 years, 
Pomerantz has represented defrauded investors, recovering well over $1 billion on its clients’ 
behalf. The firm currently serves as lead counsel in In re Petrobras Securities Litigation, No. 
14-cv-09662 (S.D.N.Y.), a group of consolidated class actions against the Brazilian energy giant 
Petrobras concerning a sprawling kickback scheme that resulted in over $19 billion in asset 
impairment and charges. Courts throughout the country have recognized Pomerantz’s 
qualifications to serve as class counsel, and Pomerantz has recently been appointed lead counsel 
in actions including Pirnik v. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, N.V. et al., No. 15-cv-07199 
(S.D.N.Y.), Lerner v. Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. et al., No. 15-cv-02532 (D. Md.), Plumley 
v. Sempra Energy et al., 16-cv-00512 (S.D. Cal.), and In re KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Securities Litigation, 15-cv-05841 (N.D. Cal.). 
Similarly, Bernstein Litowitz – which developed and filed this Action – is among the 
preeminent securities class action law firms in the country. Bernstein Litowitz served as Lead 
Counsel in In re WorldCom, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 02-cv-03288-DLC (S.D.N.Y.), in 
which settlements totaling in excess of $6 billion—one of the largest recoveries in securities Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 17 of 20 PageID: 200
{00208703;3 } 13 class action history—were obtained for the Class. Recently, Bernstein Litowitz secured a 
resolution of $2.43 billion in In re Bank of America Corp. Securities, Derivative & ERISA 
Litigation, No. 09-md-2058-PKC (S.D.N.Y.), and a $730 million settlement in In re Citigroup 
Inc. Bond Litigation, No. 08-cv-9522-SHS (S.D.N.Y.) on behalf of the Class. Bernstein Litowitz 
also served as Co-Lead Counsel in In re Cendant Corporation Securities Litigation, No. 98-cv-
01664-WHW-ES (D.N.J.) in this District, in which settlements in excess of $3 billion in cash and 
extensive corporate governance reforms were obtained on behalf of the class. 
Also in this District, Bernstein Litowitz recently served as Co-Lead Counsel in In re 
Schering-Plough Corporation/Enhance Litigation, No. 08-cv-0397-DMC-JAD (D.N.J.) and In re 
Merck & Co. Inc. Vytorin/Zetia Securities Litigation, No. 08-cv-2177-DMC-JAD (D.N.J.), in 
which combined settlements of $688 million were obtained on behalf of investors. Other cases 
in which courts in the Third Circuit, including courts in this District, have recognized Bernstein 
Litowitz as adequate and qualified class counsel include: In re Lucent Technologies, Inc. 
Securities Litigation, No. 00-cv-0621-JAP-MCA (D.N.J.) (recovering $667 million for investors) 
and In re Wilmington Trust Securities Litigation, No. 10-cv-0990-SLR (D. Del.) (Bernstein 
Litowitz currently serving as Co-Lead Counsel). 
Moreover, Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz have a history of working together to 
jointly prosecute securities fraud class actions. In fact, the firms served as Co-Lead Counsel in 
In re Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 13-cv-00157 (E.D. Va.), in 
which they recently achieved a recovery of $42 million for investors (pending court approval). 
As a result of the firms’ extensive experience in litigation involving issues similar to 
those raised in the instant action, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group’s counsel have the skill 
and knowledge which will enable them to prosecute this action effectively and expeditiously. 
Thus, the Court may be assured that by approving the selection of counsel by the Perrigo 
Institutional Investor Group, the members of the class will receive the best legal representation 
available. Case 2:16-cv-02805-MCA-LDW Document 6-1 Filed 07/18/16 Page 18 of 20 PageID: 201
{00208703;3 } 14 CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group respectfully requests 
that the Court issue an Order: (1) appointing the Perrigo Institutional Investor Group as Lead 
Plaintiff for the Class; (2) approving its selection of Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz to serve 
as Co-Lead Counsel for the Class; and (3) granting such other relief as the Court may deem to be 
just and proper.

Migdal to take provident funds out of investment bank unit

Migdal has NIS 13.2 billion in assets under management.



Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings Ltd. (TASE: MGDL) is taking steps to consolidate all its provident and advanced training funds business under Migdal Insurance, after removing the bulk of this business from the company's investment house, Migdal Capital Markets. Midgal has filed a request with the Tel Aviv District Court to distribute a dividend in kind, as part of the consolidation all its provident funds business under Makefet Provident and Pension Funds Ltd. Migdal plans to carry out the consolidation by the end of the year. Migdal wants court permission to distribute all of its 100% holding in Migdal Capital Markets as a dividend in kind amounting to an estimated NIS 595 million. In a related step, Migdal Capital Markets will distribute all of its 100% holding in Migdal Platinum Provident Fund as a dividend in kind worth NIS 101 million. Since the companies in question are wholly-owned subsidiaries, the measures are essentially technical.   
        




The main change relates to the transfer of Israel's largest advanced training fund manager, Kahal Employees Supplementary Training Fund, to Migdal. Migdal has NIS 13.2 billion in assets under management, of which Kahal has NIS 7.94 billion in assets under management. In addition, Makafet manages Israel's second largest pension fund, New Makefet, which has NIS 19.7 billion in assets under management. When the measures are completed, Migdal Capital Markets will only manage short-term financial and savings products.

                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

But anyone looking at today's CMI model and believing they now know for certain that their liabilities are lower need to remember there is risk in retaining longevity exposure.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  Longevity improvements have slowed materially in the retired population, according to the Continuous Mortality Investigation. But anyone looking at today's CMI model and believing they now know for certain that their liabilities are lower need to remember there is risk in retaining longevity exposure.

  Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

  A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

Recently, however, plan sponsors have come to understand that an insurer’s service delivery capabilities are just as important as its financial strength and capacity.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.
