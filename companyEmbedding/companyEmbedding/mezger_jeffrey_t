President and Chief Executive Officer







KB Home 



















 
 









Jeff Mezger serves as President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Board of KB Home, one of the nation’s largest homebuilders.
As the son of a homebuilder, Mezger’s experience runs even deeper than the 30+ years he has spent as an executive in the industry. His passion for the homebuilding business and well-known focus on the customer can be traced back to his early years working side-by-side with his father to build homes for customers one at a time.
Today, Mezger still adheres to a philosophy of providing personalized service and home design to each and every KB Home homebuyer across the country. KB Home’s Built to Order approach to homebuilding gives customers an unprecedented level of choice in building their new homes – from the layout of the floor plan to selecting among the 5,000 design options at KB Home Studios. Based on the Company’s KBnxt operating model, data on customer preferences and market opportunities drive product offerings and land strategy, while economies of scale and operational efficiencies ensure the lowest possible cost to the buyer. In fact, KB Home has been providing high-quality and well-priced homes to families for more than 50 years.
Mezger brings a strong emphasis on operational excellence to KB Home's well-known reputation for innovation in finding new ways to reach and serve its customers. Recognizing that the vast majority of its homebuyers were families with children, KB Home formed a unique collaboration with the ultimate family brand, Disney, to offer exclusive Disney Home products to KB Home homebuyers. KB Home’s groundbreaking collaboration with Martha Stewart to bring co-branded communities designed by the home style icon to homebuyers across the country is unmatched in the industry. And the Company’s joint venture with Countrywide Financial brought the services of the nation’s leading mortgage lender directly to KB Home homebuyers in a seamless process. In addition to their numerous benefits for homebuyers, these high profile partnerships have ensured KB Home’s long-standing position as the most recognized brand in homebuilding.
Prior to being appointed President and CEO in 2006, Mezger served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of KB Home since 1999. In this role, Mezger was responsible for all U.S. homebuilding operations. From 2001 to 2004, he directed an aggressive diversification and acquisition strategy that doubled the number of the Company's major markets and expanded operations from coast-to-coast. In fiscal 2006, KB Home revenues reached $11 billion as the Company delivered homes in 40 markets.
Mezger joined KB Home in 1993 as President of the Company’s Antelope Valley, California division and was quickly distinguished for his operational expertise. He was later named Senior Vice President and Regional General Manager of the Company's Southwest region, overseeing all Nevada and Arizona operations, including the integration of Lewis Homes, the largest privately-held builder in the U.S. Prior to joining KB Home, Mezger spent 15 years with U.S. Home, rising to the position of President of the company’s Central California division.
A recognized opinion leader in the homebuilding industry, Mezger holds a seat on the executive board of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate and is on the Policy Advisory Board for the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. He is also a member of the NAHB High Production Builders Council and has served as an officer on numerous boards of the NAHB.
A native of Chicago, Mezger graduated from DePauw University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics.

Jeffrey Mezger Profile :
Pres., CEO - KB Home 

 


Jeffrey Mezger Biography :


Jeffrey T. Mezger serves as President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Board of KB Home.A 30-year veteran of the homebuilding industry, Mezger is recognized as the driving force behind KB Home's core KBnxt business model, the engine powering the company's growth. KBnxt shifted away from the industry's tradition of pre-building homes without buyers to an innovative and disciplined build-to-order approach grounded in fact-based, survey-driven market and land acquisition strategies. Reflecting the achievements of KBnxt, Mezger brings a strong emphasis on operational excellence to KB Home's well-known reputation for innovation. He believes a successful homebuilding business combines customer-focused, personalized home design with operational efficiencies and economies of scale that help the business take advantage of market changes.Prior to being appointed President and CEO in 2006, Mezger was Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of KB Home from 1999 to 2006. In this role, Mezger was responsible for U.S. homebuilding operations, overseeing 36 divisions operating in 40 markets in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. Under his watch, KB Home grew from a $3.8 billion business delivering 22,460 units in 1999 to a $9.4 billion business delivering 37,140 units in 2005. From 2001 to 2004, he directed an aggressive diversification and acquisition strategy that doubled the number of the Company's major markets from 17 to 34. He also oversaw the expansion of the Company's traditional product line of entry-level and move-up single-family homes to cover a broad range of products that meet the demands of today's homebuyers, including higher density infill and luxury residences. Mezger has been instrumental in creating KB Home's culture of operational excellence and has transformed the Company into a quality and customer service leader. Believing that the KB Home team is critical to the Company's success, Mezger has fostered an environment where employee innovation is recognized and rewarded and where each employee promotes the brand in every interaction with customers. Mezger has also spearheaded major quality initiatives, including KB Home's participation in the National Housing Quality certification program. Under Mezger's leadership, KB Home became the first national homebuilder to implement the rigorous training and education for trade partners required by the certification program, resulting in increased quality construction for customers. He also drove the development of the Company's "Say Yes" approach to customer service that ensures homeowner needs are addressed before and after a home purchase. The "Say Yes" commitment embodies KB Home's approach of total focus on the customer and sets the KB Home brand apart from the competition. In 2005, Mezger helped launch a ground-breaking joint venture between KB Home and Countrywide Home Loans, Countrywide KB Home Loans, a unique partnership between a major homebuilder and one of the country's leading mortgage lenders. Countrywide KB Home Loans gives KB Home a core advantage over other homebuilders by offering KB Home customers hundreds of financing options. The partnership has also allowed KB Home to focus on its core expertise: putting the customer at the center of the homebuying process to ensure the strongest customer satisfaction and highest quality homes. Mezger joined KB Home in July 1993 as President of the Company's Antelope Valley, California division and, following his strong performance there, became President of KB Home Phoenix, where he quickly distinguished himself in leading division operations. He launched the Company's Tucson division with the acquisition of Estes Homes and became President of the newly expanded KB Home Arizona, overseeing the fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson markets. He then brought this operational expertise to the entire region as Senior Vice President and Regional General Manager of the Company's Southwest region, overseeing all Nevada and Arizona operations, including the integration of Lewis Homes, the largest privately-held builder in the U.S. Before joining KB Home, Mezger spent 15 years with U.S. Home, where in 1983 he was promoted to President of the company's Central California division, which expanded under his watch to include Bakersfield, Fresno and the Antelope Valley. A recognized opinion leader in the homebuilding industry, Mezger holds a seat on the executive board of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate and is on the Policy Advisory Board for the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. He is also a member of the NAHB High Production Builders Council and has served as an officer on numerous boards of the NAHB.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
