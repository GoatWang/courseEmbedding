Predecessor Company’s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the
“Notes” ); and

WHEREAS, on the date of this
Supplemental Indenture, the Predecessor Issuer has merged with and
into the Successor Issuer, with the Successor Issuer as the
surviving entity (the “Merger” ); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.01(a)
of the Original Indenture, the Successor Issuer desires to enter
into this Supplemental Indenture expressly assuming all of the
Predecessor Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the
Original Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section
5.01(a)(iv) of the Original Indenture, each Subsidiary Guarantor
desires to confirm in writing that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall
apply to the Successor Issuer’s obligations under the Notes,
the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement; and

WHEREAS, this Supplemental Indenture
is permitted under Section 8.01(a)(ii) of the Original Indenture,
without the consent of the holders of the Notes.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Successor Issuer, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree
for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as

5. NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN
. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND

THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE
REQUIRED THEREBY.

6. COUNTERPARTS . The
parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental
Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of
them together represent the same agreement.

7. EFFECT OF HEADINGS
. The Section headings herein are for convenience only and
