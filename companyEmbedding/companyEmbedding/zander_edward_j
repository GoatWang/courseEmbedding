Personal[edit]
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]
Career at Sun Microsystems[edit]
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at Motorola[edit]
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.[5]
Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]
Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]
In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

Edward J. Zander (born January 12, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American business executive. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board of Motorola from January 2004 until January 2008, remaining as chairman until May 2008.

After leaving Sun in 2002, he became managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a private-equity firm. He also serves on the board of directors for Jason Foundation for Education, on the science advisory board of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he received a degree in electrical engineering), the advisory board for IOCOM Communications, and the advisory board of the Boston University School of Management (where he received his Master of Business Administration and later an honorary D.H.L.).

Personal[edit]
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]
Career at Sun Microsystems[edit]
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at Motorola[edit]
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.[5]
Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]
Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]
In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

  Motorola’s CEO Edward J. Zander


What are the trade-offs that must be considered in making the decision to re-structure in order to best implement strategy as opposed to taking the organization as a given, and developing a strategy keeping structure fixed?                    
	There are many organizations currently operating on business models and strategies that were developed several to many years ago. These models and strategies may work but can they be better? Over the past decade information technology has advanced, e-business models have exploded, the Internet has been on fire, and CEO’s have changed so fast it can make you dizzy.                                                                                                      
	Should a new CEO of an organization consider a restructuring in order to best implement a strategy for today’s changing business practices or just continue with the organization as given? Before deciding a CEO must clearly consider if this will “improve profitability, improve returns on company assets, lower the organizations break even point, reduce financial and operational risks, and increase shareholder value” (www. solvency.com). To use a health care analogy the CEO must decide if the company is in need of life support (needs a restructuring) or does it just have a simple cold (may just need some business practice changes).                                                                           
There are several benefits to an organizational restructuring.

Fahlenbrach & Stulz (2011) discover verification that banks with higher shareholder- management incentive alignment, options holdings or through stock executed worse during the financial crisis.

His controversial decision to release information detailing the highly illegal ‘data mining’ practices of the N.S.A have caused shockwaves throughout the world and have raised important questions concerning how much the government actually monitors its people without their consent or knowledge.

 As a more competitive global economy emerges CEO’s of American organizations must consider implementing aggressive plans to restructure and downsize. They must focus on “cost-cutting efforts, the adoption of new technology and renewed efforts on core products and market strategies” (www. solvency.com).                                                                                                                             
There are also benefits in maintaining an organizations current structure and just providing some better business practices to improve the organizations operations. The cost in of doing this is remarkable less then a full restructuring, the staff remains comfortable without the fear of drastic change and the business continues without much interruption or interference of a full restructuring.                                                                                                       
The CEO must carefully decide on whether to restructure or maintain the current structure of an organization. Overall the decision must lead to reduced expenses, increased profits, improved cash flow, and productivity, increased shareholder value, decreased organizational beaurocracy, increased market share, decision-making, sales, and customer satisfaction.                                                                                                                                              
Which is Zander doing? 
In 2004 Ed Zander was elected as Motorola’s new CEO and brought a wealth of experience to Motorola. He had over 25 years of experience in the technology area and was previously the CEO of Sun Micro Systems. 
It did not take the Motorola staff long to recognize that Ed Zander was different from their previous CEO. He was known as a “Brash Brooklynite” (Crockett). He was everything the previous CEO was not. He was demanding, expected results, and would hold individuals accountable. His immediate focus was on improving innovation and operational efficiency.                                                                                                                                                         
As the new CEO of Motorola Ed Zander needed to decide whether he wanted to accept the company’s structure as is or to implement is own restructuring plan. Ed Zander immediately seen that the company was plagued by employee, quality, and communication issues, financial confusion, and delayed launch dates for new products. 
Motorola had many challenges and opportunities. It was “plagued by a slow-moving culture that did not recognize the looming opportunity in converged mobile devices” (Krazit). Zander made the quick decision that Motorola needed immediate and drastic change and was set to restructure the company.                                                                                         
Zander’s vision for Motorola was for “seamless motility.” “Seamless mobility," is a “world where someone can be connected to the Internet in the home, in the office, in his or her automobile, or just walking down the street” (Krazit).
“Just as important as the structural changes will be the strategy that goes with it” (Crockett). Zander stepped into a very hostile culture and had a lot to prove. “Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes" and Zander had to act quickly and get them to work as a team (Crockett).                                                                               
To achieve teamwork he created a bonus structure for employees that “based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, and cooperation between departments.” His business strategy also included targeting major corporations for “communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear” (en.wikipedia.org).                                                                        
Zander saw a need to restructure Motorola's business divisions and trim costs. Several divisions were performing duplicate services and he saw the opportunity to streamline production, reduce costs and unnecessary positions. 
Zander understands that when it comes down to business it is providing the customer what they want when they want it and providing shareholder value.	                                                                                                                            
Did Zander make the correct decision? 
	His restructuring plan appeared to be a good move. In a time when competition was tough he trimmed the company down, reduced costs, and developed new products that would keep the business growing. His strategy appeared to be on track but fell short in providing improved shareholder value. From his takeover as CEO in 2004 to today he has improved the companies stock by only 3.8 percent with a dividend pay out of 3.7 percent for an over all annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. Considering a money market savings account paid an average of 3.54 percent and the S&P 500 was up about 13 percent annually, I would say his performance has severely underperformed and was lackluster in the least.

Personal
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[1]
who couldn't afford college and stressed education to their
children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but
instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill
parents. His mother, now blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece
after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in
1922.[1]
Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends
because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently
demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good
fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New
York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is now
married to Mona Zander, and the couple has two sons.[2]
Career at Sun
Microsystems
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987.
Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the
role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming
president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same
position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998 he was
promoted to COO for the entire company and
was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999.
Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which
included engineering, product
development, sales, service and
marketing. The CTO and corporate brand
marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy
reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan
Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at
Motorola
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of
directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in
September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at
the head of the electronics giant.
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and
Mike Zafirovski, though well-known
executives such as AT&T's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard
Notebaert and Verizon Communications' Lawrence Babbio were also considered.
Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at
Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone
business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was
looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though
Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the
corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with
someone with more experience in a complex organization like
Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover
and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the
position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the
company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the
board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he
resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His
first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun
just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He
announced that he would focus the company on its consumer
electronics business and start taking better care of its customers
(he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to
one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he
acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He
also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the
government, cable set-top box components and wireless
communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's
departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a
bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer
satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between
departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations
for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at
customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A
reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely.
Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding
Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He
established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate
Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the
company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter
of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first
demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of
directors.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to
then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as
chairman by David
Dorman in May 2008.

Edward J. ZanderBorn(1947-01-12) January 12, 1947 (age 70)Brooklyn, New YorkEducationBachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Master of Business Administration from Questrom School of BusinessKnown forIT executiveEdward J. Zander (born January 12, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York) is an American business executive. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board of Motorola from January 2004 until January 2008, remaining as chairman until May 2008. His work in the technology sector included management positions at Data General and Apollo Computer before joining Sun Microsystems in 1987, where he was later promoted to Chief Operating Officer and President.After leaving Sun in 2002, he became managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a private-equity firm. He also serves on the board of directors for Jason Foundation for Education, on the science advisory board of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he received a degree in electrical engineering), the advisory board for IOCOM Communications, and the advisory board of the Boston University School of Management (where he received his Master of Business Administration and later an honorary D.H.L.). He was also a member of the board of directors at Seagate Technologies from 2002 to 2004, and at Time Warner Inc. from January to May 2007. He has been a member of the board of directors at EagleView Technologies Inc. since 2008.[1]Contents1 Personal2 Career at Sun Microsystems3 Career at Motorola4 References5 External linksPersonalZander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]Career at Sun MicrosystemsEdward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.Career at MotorolaOn January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered.

Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer.

Motorola Replaces Chief With an Insider

Motorola said yesterday that its chief executive, Edward J. Zander, was stepping down, a development  applauded by the dissident shareholder Carl C. Icahn,  who said the company should use the opportunity to split into four parts.Wall Street had expected Mr. Zander to step down as the company struggled to revive its troubled mobile division. He  is being succeeded by Gregory Q. Brown, the chief operating officer who has led four of the company’s business units since his arrival four years ago.Mr. Icahn applauded the ouster of Mr. Zander, saying it was long past due, but said it was not nearly enough to turn the company around.

“I believe that the steps announced today do not even begin to address the major problems at Motorola,” Mr. Icahn said. Continue reading the main story

A split would allow the wireless products division to attract top-flight executives, he said.After seeing its share of the cellphone market surge a few years ago on the runaway success of the fashionable Razr phone — the company sold a record 100 million of the devices — Motorola failed to refresh its product line. It began to cut prices, which hurt its profit margins. Motorola’s share of the mobile phone market has fallen to third place, behind Samsung and the market leader, Nokia.

“The greatest challenges are in mobile devices, returning it to profitability and extending its product portfolio,” Mr. Brown said in an interview yesterday. “It improved significantly in its move to profitability, but there’s a lot more work to do.”The news of Mr. Zander’s departure had little effect on Motorola stock. Shares closed up 32 cents at $15.97 in regular trading.Mr. Zander, 60, will continue to serve as chairman until the  annual shareholders meeting in May. Mr. Zander will also serve as strategic adviser to the chief executive and as a nonofficer employee through Jan. 5, 2009, the company said.It said Mr. Zander was entitled to a $5.3 million bonus and to all options and restricted stock units that vest before his retirement. But he will not receive a severance payment or any unvested equity because he is stepping down, the company said.Mr. Brown, 47, joined Motorola in 2003 from Micromuse, a network software company, and became president and chief operating officer in March. Mr. Zander said that he told the board two years ago that Mr. Brown would be a good candidate to lead the company.“I began throwing everything but the kitchen sink at him,” Mr. Zander said in an interview. “He is a known quantity and a great leader.”

Mr. Brown managed the $3.9 billion acquisition of Symbol Technologies, the second-largest transaction in Motorola’s history, and is credited with returning the company’s automotive business to profitability. He also expanded the company’s government and public safety business. “Thank God Greg developed as fast as he did,” Mr. Zander said.

But some Wall Street investors analysts had thought Motorola might name a successor for Mr. Zander from outside the company, perhaps seeing an opportunity for a more significant change of direction.“This says the board likes the plan and is focused on execution,” said Bill Choi, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. “We’ll have to wait and see.”

Paul Sagawa, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, described Mr. Brown as a “blank slate.” The key will be whether, under his leadership, Motorola can produce the kinds of technologies that can help it turn itself around, Mr. Sagawa said. “The cavalry has been slow in coming when it comes to new products,“ he said.Mr. Zander insisted Friday that the decision to leave now was his own, and that he was looking forward to time with his family. Mr. Zander came to Motorola in 2004 about a year after resigning as president of Sun Microsystems. At the time, he was serving as a managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Mr. Zander has felt considerable shareholder pressure this year, most notably from Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor,  who led a fight for a seat on Motorola’s board. But at Motorola’s annual shareholders meeting in May, Mr. Icahn lost a proxy fight for a board seat, and Mr. Zander promised investors a turnaround this year.

Edward J. Zander (born January 12, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American business executive. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board of Motorola from January 2004 until January 2008, remaining as chairman until May 2008.

Personal[edit]
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]
Career at Sun Microsystems[edit]
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at Motorola[edit]
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.[5]
Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]
Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]
In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

Personal[edit]
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]
Career at Sun Microsystems[edit]
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at Motorola[edit]
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.[5]
Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]
Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]
In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

Edward J. Zander (born January 12, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American business executive. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board of Motorola from January 2004 until January 2008, remaining as chairman until May 2008. His work in the technology sector included management positions at Data General and Apollo Computer before joining Sun Microsystems in 1987, where he was later promoted to Chief Operating Officer and President.
After leaving Sun in 2002, he became managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a private-equity firm. He also serves on the board of directors for Jason Foundation for Education, on the science advisory board of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he received a degree in electrical engineering), the advisory board for IOCOM Communications, and the advisory board of the Boston University School of Management (where he received his Master of Business Administration and later an honorary D.H.L.). He was also a member of the board of directors at Seagate Technologies from 2002 to 2004, and at Time Warner Inc. from January to May 2007. He has been a member of the board of directors at EagleView Technologies Inc. since 2008.[1]

Personal[edit]
Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother),[2] who couldn't afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. His mother, blind with glaucoma, emigrated from Greece after her entire family was wiped out by Turkish nationalists in 1922.[2] Growing up, he was given the nickname "Fast Eddie" by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the "hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight." Zander himself remarked, "I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast" (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.[3]
Career at Sun Microsystems[edit]
Edward Zander's career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, first taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun's software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun's systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun's seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing.[2] The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.
After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.
Career at Motorola[edit]
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.[4]
The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&T Corporation's President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International's Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications's Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical "mover and shaker" attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.
Zander had a lot to prove, and he quickly went to work. His first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.
Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola's departments have been referred to as "warring tribes". He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola's business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of "seamless mobility" to integrate Motorola's products and create a sense of unity within the company.
After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.[5]
Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola's financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.[6]
Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics.[7][8] By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[9] Under Zander, Ron Garriques who was responsible for the successful RAZR departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola's Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.[8]
In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.[10] Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine's Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone. [9] Ed Zander “inspired” Steve Jobs with Moto's multimedia (e.g., iTune) + smartphone product concept. In result, Apple gained new product concept which was named "iPhone" while Motorola ironically walked away with limited version of iTunes app for Rokr/Slvr.
Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

Moribund Motorola loses CEO
2nd 
                        December 2007  
After suffering from a prolonged bout of sliding 
                        sales, cost cuts and collapsing profits, Motorola have 
                        finally parted from top man Ed Zander (pictured) in 
                        a move that many investors will welcome.
Motorola is not purely a mobile phone company, but 
                        handsets account for a large proportion of business. 
                        Motorola's recent successes and failures have mostly 
                        been on the back of the Motorola RAZR design that had 
                        proven to be a costly addiction (see our article "Why 
                        the RAZR is killing Motorola" for a more in-depth 
                        view). 
So is Zander to blame for Motorola's moribund performance? 
                        Although our view is that he has hardly been inspiring, 
                        we feel that Motorola's problems are much deeper. As 
                        a technology company, Motorola has interests in all 
                        sorts of computing and communications businesses and 
                        competitors such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson are focussed 
                        very much on mobile handsets. But even that is not the 
                        real problem - LG and Samsung have a huge variety of 
                        consumer and industrial products, and even they manage 
                        to shine brighter than Motorola.
Ed Zander will be replaced by Motorola's Chief Operating 
                        Officer Greg Brown in January. The new CEO will need 
                        to revitalise Motorola with a new range of products 
                        that appeal to consumers and can compete head-on with 
                        the competition. 
We've been waiting for Motorola to get its act together 
                        for a long time. Perhaps this change of leadership will 
                        make Motorola a truly interesting and innovative company 
                        again.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
