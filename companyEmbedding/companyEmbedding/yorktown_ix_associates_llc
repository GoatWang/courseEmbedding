”), ECP Mezzanine B (Ramaco IP), LP (“ ECP
Mezzanine B ” and together with ECP Mezzanine and ECP
Mezzanine A, “ ECP ”), Randall W. Atkins
(“ Atkins ”) and Michael D. Bauersachs
(“ Bauersachs ”). Ramaco Development, the
Company, Merger Sub, Yorktown, ECP, Atkins and Bauersachs are each
individually referred to herein as a “ Party
” and collectively, the “ Parties
”.

RECITALS

WHEREAS , in anticipation of, and prior to the
completion of, an initial public offering of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (“ Common Stock ”),
of the Company (the “ Offering ”)
pursuant to, and as more fully described in, a registration
statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
Registration No. 333-215363 (the “ Registration
Statement ”), the Parties shall enter into certain
restructuring transactions (the “
Reorganization ”) as more particularly
described herein;

WHEREAS , in connection with the Offering and the
Reorganization, the Parties desire to, among other things,
(i) establish the economic terms of the Reorganization, and
(ii) enter into certain agreements to effectuate the
foregoing; and

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the foregoing
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows, and
further agree that the actions set forth in Article I
shall be deemed to have been taken and become effective in the
order set forth therein.

ARTICLE I

RESTRUCTURING
TRANSACTIONS

Section 1.1. Underwriting
Agreement . Effective
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company, the
Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters shall enter into the
Underwriting Agreement, pursuant to which the Company shall issue
and sell, and the Selling Stockholders shall sell, shares of Common
Stock to the Underwriters at a price per share equal to the IPO
Price, less the underwriting discount applied to any shares of
Common Stock to be sold by the Company to the public in the
Offering.

Section 1.2. Ramaco
Development .
Pursuant to Section 3.6(d) of the Second Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Ramaco Development
dated as of August 31, 2016, as amended (the “ LLC
Agreement ”), effective immediately following
the


transactions described in
Section 1.1 and prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
holders of Preferred Units (as defined in the LLC Agreement) shall
elect to convert all of such Preferred Units into Common Units (as
defined in the LLC Agreement). Pursuant to
Section 3.6(d)(iii) of the LLC Agreement, each holder
of Preferred Units shall receive the number of Common Units equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing the Preferred Unit Liquidation
Value by the Conversion Price then in effect (as such terms are
defined in the LLC Agreement).

Section 1.3.
Merger . Effective
as of the time set forth in the Certificate of Merger filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “
Merger Effective Time ”), which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be on the date of, but at a time prior
to, the consummation of the Offering and subsequent to the
transactions set forth in Section 1.2 above, Merger Sub
shall merge (the “ Merger ”) with and
into Ramaco Development (with Ramaco Development as the surviving
company) in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “ Merger
Agreement ”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
(i) Ramaco Development shall become a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company; (ii) the outstanding Common Units in Ramaco
Development (including, for avoidance of doubt, any Common Units
issued upon conversion of Preferred Units as described in
Section 1.2 above) shall be exchanged for shares of
Common Stock as consideration in the Merger, with each holder of
Common Units receiving approximately 2.812 shares of Common Stock
per Common Unit held by such holder immediately prior to the
Merger; and (iii) the 333,334 outstanding and unexercised
Options (as defined in the LLC Agreement) granted pursuant to
Ramaco Development’s 2016 Membership Unit Option Plan shall
be converted into options under the Company’s Long-Term
Incentive Plan to purchase, in the aggregate, 937,424 shares of the
Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.34 per
share.

Section 1.4. Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company . Effective
immediately prior to the Offering, the Company shall (i) file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “
Certificate of Incorporation ”), in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B and (ii) enter into an
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “
Bylaws ”), in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C .

Section 1.5. Registration
Rights Agreement .
Immediately prior to the Offering, the Company, Yorktown, ECP,
Atkins and Bauersachs shall enter into the Registration Rights
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
.

Section 1.6. Long-Term
Incentive Plan .
Immediately prior to the Offering, the Company will adopt the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, providing for the issuance of up to
shares of Common Stock as further described in the Registration
Statement, which has been previously approved by the board of
directors of the Company.

ARTICLE II

TAXES

Section 2.1. Tax
Treatment . The
Parties agree that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
exchange of Common Units for Common Stock pursuant to the Merger,
together with the Offering, is intended to qualify as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Internal
 
2


Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “
Code ”). Unless required to do so as a result
of a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code), each of Yorktown, ECP, Atkins, and Bauersachs (each a
“ PublicCo Contributor ,” and
collectively, the “ PublicCo Contributors
”) and the Company agrees that it will not make any tax
filing or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the
qualification of the Merger and the Offering (collectively, the
“ Transactions ”) as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code. The U.S. federal income
tax treatment of the Transactions described in the preceding
sentence is referred to herein as the “ Tax
Treatment .” If any Party becomes aware of any audit,
inquiry, litigation or other proceeding relevant to the Tax
Treatment, such person shall promptly notify the other Parties of
such proceeding, and all Parties shall use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with respect to such proceeding.

Section 2.2. Tax
Warranties by PublicCo Contributors . Each PublicCo Contributor represents and
warrants to all other PublicCo Contributors that the statements as
set forth below, solely as they relate to the Tax Treatment, are
true, correct and complete as of the date hereof and as of the
effective time of the Transactions with respect to such PublicCo
Contributor:

(a) Such PublicCo Contributor does
not have any current plan, intention, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, and has not engaged in any material negotiations,

transferring the Common Stock to be received by such PublicCo
Contributor pursuant to the Merger, except as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Registration Statement,

(ii) acquiring or retaining any
rights in the Common Units transferred to the Company pursuant to
the Merger,

(iii) subject to the organizational

Merger, or

(iv) creating, extinguishing or
modifying any indebtedness between such PublicCo Contributor and
the Company or Ramaco Development as a result of the

such PublicCo Contributor;

Contributor’s knowledge, the Transactions will occur pursuant

an entity, subject to the PublicCo Contributor’s
organizational and incentive compensation documents relating to the
economic rights of such PublicCo Contributor’s investors,
employees and consultants, to such PublicCo Contributor’s
knowledge, no direct or indirect member, partner or owner of such
PublicCo Contributor has any current plan, intention, agreement,
arrangement or understanding to sell, exchange, hedge,
constructively sell or otherwise dispose of its direct or indirect
interests in such PublicCo Contributor.

Section 2.3. Tax
Warranties by the Company . The Company represents and warrants to the
PublicCo Contributors that the statements as set forth below,
solely as they relate to the Tax Treatment, are true, correct and
complete as of the date hereof and as of the effective time of the
Transactions:

(a) To the Company’s
knowledge, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding
relating to rights or obligations to vote its Common
Stock;

(b) There is no current plan,
intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding for:

knowledge, Ramaco Development, to dispose of the Common Units or
any assets held by Ramaco Development or any of their respective
subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business;
(iii) the Company or, to the Company’s knowledge, Ramaco
Development or any other person affiliated with the Company, to
redeem or otherwise reacquire any Common Stock to be issued in

the Company’s knowledge, any underwriter, to release or waive

each PublicCo Contributor pursuant to the Merger (as described in
Section 1.3 of this Agreement) will be issued and paid
in exchange for solely the Common Units transferred by such
PublicCo Contributor to the Company pursuant to the
Merger;

(f) There is no indebtedness between
any PublicCo Contributor and either the Company or, to the
Company’s knowledge, Ramaco Development, and there will be no
such indebtedness created in favor of any PublicCo Contributor as a
result of the Transactions;

(g) The Company has no stock issued
or outstanding other than the Common Stock;

(h) To the Company’s
knowledge, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings
between or among any of the Parties relating to the Transactions,

any agreements referenced herein and the Registration
Statement;

company within the meaning of Section 351(e)(1) of the Code
