Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. Enters into Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
May 12 17
On May 11, 2017, Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, and the several lenders from time to time party thereto. The New Credit Agreement amends and restates the Partnership’s existing senior secured credit facility. The New Credit Agreement permits the Partnership to borrow up to $450.0 million on a revolving credit basis, and the maturity date of the New Credit Agreement is May 11, 2022. Upon the closing of the New Credit Agreement, the Partnership had approximately $307.6 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.5 million of outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Agreement, leaving the Partnership with approximately $140.9 million available commitments for additional borrowings and letters of credit under the New Credit Agreement, although the Partnership’s ability to borrow such funds may be limited by the financial covenants in the New Credit Agreement. In connection with entering into the New Credit Agreement, the Partnership paid certain upfront fees to the lenders thereunder, and the Partnership paid certain arrangement and other fees to the arrangers and agents of the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of the Partnership’s existing subsidiaries. Obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Partnership’s assets and those of the guarantors. The New Credit Agreement includes procedures for additional financial institutions to become lenders, or for any existing lender to increase its revolving commitment thereunder, subject to an aggregate maximum of $600.0 million for all loan commitments under the New Credit Agreement. The Partnership may prepay all loans under the New Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs), subject to certain notice requirements. The New Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding thereunder with the net proceeds of certain asset sales, property or casualty insurance claims, and condemnation proceedings, unless the Partnership reinvests such proceeds in accordance with the New Credit Agreement, but these mandatory prepayments will not require any reduction of the lenders’ commitments under the New Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Partnership’s option, at either the reserve-adjusted eurodollar rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 2.0% to 3.0% or the alternate base rate (the highest of the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1%, and the 30-day eurodollar rate plus 1%) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.0% to 2.0%. The Partnership pays a per annum fee on all letters of credit issued under the New Credit Agreement, which fee equals the applicable margin for loans accruing interest based on the eurodollar rate, and the Partnership pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% on the unused commitments under the New Credit Agreement. The applicable margins for the Partnership’s interest rate, the letter of credit fee and the commitment fee vary quarterly based on the Partnership’s consolidated total leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement, being generally computed as the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges). The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. Prior to the date on which the Partnership issues qualified senior notes in an aggregate principal amount (when combined with all other qualified senior notes previously or concurrently issued) that equals or exceeds $200.0 million, the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio is 4.75 to 1.00; provided that the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio will be 5.25 to 1.00 for certain quarters based on the occurrence of a specified acquisition (as defined in the New Credit Agreement, but generally being an acquisition for which the aggregate consideration is $15.0 million or more). The acquisition of the nine asphalt terminals from Ergon in October 2016 qualified as a specific acquisition. The maximum permitted consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement, but generally computed as the ratio of consolidated total secured debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges) is 3.50 to 1.00, but this covenant is only tested from and after the date on which the Partnership issues qualified senior notes in an aggregate principal amount (when combined with all other qualified senior previously or concurrently issued) that equals or exceeds $200.0 million. The minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement, but generally computed as the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges to consolidated interest expense) is 2.50 to 1.00.

OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: BKEP) (Common Units) (NASDAQ: 
      BKEPP) (Series A Preferred Units) (“BKEP” 
      or the “Partnership”), announced today that 
      Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc., a subsidiary of Jackson, 
      Mississippi-based Ergon, Inc. (“Ergon”), 
      has agreed to purchase 100% of the membership interests of Blueknight GP 
      Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the outstanding membership interests 
      of the general partner of BKEP, which owns the general partner interest 
      and the incentive distribution rights of BKEP. Ergon also has agreed to 
      (i) contribute nine asphalt terminals it currently owns plus $22.1 
      million of cash to BKEP in return for total consideration of 
      approximately $130.9 million, which consists of the issuance of 
      18,312,968 Series A preferred units in a private placement, and (ii) 
      acquire an aggregate of $5.0 million of common units for cash in a 
      private placement. In addition, BKEP has agreed to repurchase 13,335,390 
      of its Series A preferred units currently owned by Blueknight Energy 
      Holding, Inc. (“Vitol”) and CB-Blueknight, 
      LLC (“Charlesbank” and, together with 
      Vitol, the “Existing Sponsors”) for $95.3 
      million. The Existing Sponsors will retain their remaining 4,977,578 
      Series A preferred units. The nine terminals acquired by BKEP from Ergon 
      are located in Wolcott, Kansas; Ennis, Texas; Chandler, Arizona; Mt. 
      Pleasant, Texas; Pleasanton, Texas; Birmingport, Alabama; Memphis, 
      Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee; and Yellow Creek, Mississippi, and 
      include approximately 2.0 million barrels of storage capacity. Once the 
      transactions described above have closed, Blueknight will own a network 
      of 54 asphalt terminals in 26 states with a combined capacity of 10.2 
      million barrels of asphalt and residual fuel oil storage.
    

      Ergon’s purchase of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., Ergon’s contribution 
      of terminals and cash to BKEP and BKEP’s repurchase of the Existing 
      Sponsors’ Series A preferred units is conditioned on the closing of each 
      of the other transactions. In addition, the transactions are subject to 
      other customary closing conditions, including expiration of the 
      applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
      Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other regulatory approvals and 
      the distribution to holders of Series A preferred units of an 
      information statement on Schedule 14C. Such transactions are expected to 
      close on or before September 30, 2016. BKEP has amended its credit 
      facility to address this change of control and has modified certain 
      terms of the facility, the terms of which will be filed on Form 8-K with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
    

      The Conflicts Committee of the board of directors of Blueknight Energy 
      Partners G.P., L.L.C., the general partner of BKEP, has approved Ergon’s 
      contribution of terminals and cash to BKEP and BKEP’s repurchase of the 
      Existing Sponsors’ Series A preferred units. Evercore served as 
      financial advisor to the Conflicts Committee and Potter Anderson & 
      Corroon LLP served as legal counsel to the Conflicts Committee.
    

      Wells Fargo Securities, LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to 
      Ergon.
    

      Comments from BKEP CEO Mark Hurley:
    

      “We look forward to a new era with Ergon as the future owner of our 
      general partner. As a long-term customer at 18 of our asphalt terminals 
      we have admired their capabilities and expertise. We also have come to 
      realize we share the same values to operate with discipline and 
      integrity. The strategic combination of the two companies and the 
      addition of nine asphalt facilities to our portfolio will create 
      opportunities for growth and increased shareholder value over the 
      long-term. Our two businesses offer a collection of compatible 
      operations which further enhance and strengthen our diversification. In 
      addition to the purchase of the general partner from Vitol and 
      Charlesbank and nine additional asphalt terminals, Ergon will enter into 
      an exclusive long-term services agreement for the facilities. We expect 
      this transaction to be immediately accretive to the Partnership 
      generating an anticipated first year cash flow multiple in the 8-9 times 
      range. As we move forward with the transaction, we do not anticipate our 
      current base business or customer relationships to be impacted. We will 
      continue to serve a variety of customers across our terminalling and 
      transportation businesses. Vitol and Charlesbank have been instrumental 
      in the development of our company and they have put us in the position 
      to pursue this transformative opportunity with Ergon. Vitol, in addition 
      to being an important strategic sponsor, is also a significant customer. 
      We expect our customer relationship with Vitol to remain in place moving 
      forward.”
    

      Comments from Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. Chairman Bill Lampton:
    

      “Ergon has had a long-term desire to help build a world class midstream 
      Master Limited Partnership and believes its investment in Blueknight 
      will help achieve that goal. We believe that we are an ideal sponsor to 
      help support and facilitate the growth of Blueknight through our 
      experience in the ownership of pipelines, terminalling and storage 
      facilities and other similar assets. We expect Blueknight to be a growth 
      vehicle on its own with support from Ergon. We have also identified two 
      additional terminals that may be dropped into Blueknight over the next 
      couple of years. We expect that those drop downs would be of similar 
      size to other successful acquisitions completed by Blueknight in the 
      last 18 months. We also value the diversity of customers that Blueknight 
      currently enjoys and will continue to encourage the development and 
      expansion of those relationships. We do not anticipate any day-to-day 
      changes with the overall operation of Blueknight’s business.”
    

      Comments from Charlesbank/Vitol:
    

      “We have valued our partnership with Blueknight but see this as a 
      strategic opportunity for the company. Ergon has been a long-term 
      customer for BKEP and its businesses are strategically aligned with the 
      Partnership’s business. In addition, we at Vitol have enjoyed a 
      long-term business relationship and would expect to continue that 
      relationship going forward. We believe we are leaving the Partnership in 
      capable hands and wish the company the best in the future.”

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
