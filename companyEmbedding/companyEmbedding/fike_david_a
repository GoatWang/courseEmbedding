David J. Fike
PhD
President at Golden Gate University







David J. Fike, PhD became GGU's seventh President in August of 2015.
Dr. Fike was formerly the president of Marygrove College, a century-old liberal arts
                              institution in Detroit. He joined Marygrove in 2005, serving as provost for one year
                              before becoming Marygrove's president. During his nine-year presidential tenure, Dr.
                              Fike provided the strategic vision that recast the college's legacy as a commitment
                              to develop students' talents, skills, and dispositions to lead in urban communities
                              and he garnered the resources, including a three-year $1.5M curriculum development
                              grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, to support faculty in carrying out this commitment.
                           
Dr. Fike has ties to the San Francisco Bay Area. Prior to his appointment at Marygrove,
                              he was chief academic officer and dean of faculty at Holy Names University in Oakland,
                              California, a position he held from 1997 until 2005. As chief academic officer, he
                              had oversight of the $6.5M annual Academic Affairs Division budget, all academic programs,
                              campus information technology, library services, student registration processes, learning
                              support resources and advising services. He joined Holy Names in 1992 as a faculty
                              member in economics, teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels and serving
                              as a frequent guest lecturer and presenter on such topics as socially responsible
                              investing, economic revitalization and community development.
                           
Dr. Fike has served as an elected official in Kensington, California, from 1994 to
                              1998. He has held numerous appointed positions on boards and commissions, including
                              the BioScience Workforce Advisory Team for the City of Oakland, the Life Sciences
                              Task Force of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, the Bay Area's Community Capital
                              Investment Initiative, the Community Reinvestment Subcommittee of Alameda County's
                              Economic Development Advisory Board, the City of Oakland's Sustainable Community Development
                              Commission, the BayTEC Board of Directors, the Board of Directors of AnewAmerica Community

As an economist specializing in capital markets and urban economic development, Dr.
                              Fike has provided consulting services and research in the areas of economic revitalization,
                              sustainable community development practices, capital access in underserved markets,
                              and strategic decision-making. His clients have included the City of Oakland (participating
                              in the development of the Mayor's Economic Development Strategy, among other projects)
                              and the Community Bank of the Bay, the first de novo community development bank in
                              the western United States.
                           
Dr. Fike also served as part of a team sent to Central America to develop a strategic
                              plan for the establishment of a nationally chartered bank to finance infrastructure
                              projects for El Salvador's cooperative sector.
                           
In 1995, Dr. Fike was granted a prestigious Kellogg National Leadership Fellowship.
                              As a fellow, he investigated innovative public/private partnerships designing sustainable

                              of socially responsible investing, economic revitalization and community development,
                              and he is the recipient of teaching awards from the University of Maryland, College

Website: Stable Isotope BiogeochemistryResearch InterestsIsotope GeochemistryProfessor Fike is interested in the detailed working of global biogeochemical cycles, their evolution over Earth history, and their impact on biological evolution. Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry involves the analysis and interpretation of the stable isotopic compositions of a variety of elements that make up minerals and organic matter. In the modern, stable isotope biogeochemistry is used to understand biological cycling within microbially-dominated environments (e.g., microbial mats, or marine sediments), reconstruct larger-scale ecosystem dynamics and food webs, and trace the development of human agriculture (e.g., the spread of maize domestication). Isotope studies of carbon and sulfur in sedimentary strata provide one of the most powerful tools for reconstructing environmental change throughout Earth history, particularly oxygenation events during both the Paleoproterozoic (~2.2-2.5 billion years ago) and the late Neoproterozoic (~635 - 541 million years ago). On a global-scale, these isotopes provide the best estimate for global biological productivity as well as the burial of both reduced carbon (organic matter) and sulfur (pyrite), which are the two dominant factors that regulate atmospheric oxygen levels (pO2). Ongoing projects include mapping the evolution of carbon and sulfur cycling during the course of the Cambrian ‘Explosion’ using sedimentary carbonates from the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the deposition of Ediacaran and Phanerozoic sulfate evaporites, the study of modern acidic sulfates as analogs for Martian environments, and the mapping of micron-scale sulfur cycling in modern microbial mats and sedimentary environments. These projects combine a mixture of fieldwork, laboratory extractions and isotope analyses, and modeling.PublicationsFike, D. A. 2010. Earth's redox evolution.
