	Grant of non-qualified stock option under the Farmer Bros. Co. Amended and Restated 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan"); the stock option vests pursuant to a three year vesting schedule, whereby one-third of the total number of shares issuable under the option becomes exercisable each year on the anniversary of the grant date, commencing on November 10, 2017, based on the Company's achievement of a modified net income target for fiscal 2017 ("Target") as approved by the Compensation Committee, and the acceleration provisions of the Plan and stock option agreement, and subject to the participant's employment by the Company or service on the Board of Directors of the Company on the applicable vesting date. Twenty percent (20%) of the total number of shares subject to each stock option will be forfeited if the Company's actual modified net income for fiscal 2017 is lower than the Target.

Dear preneproducts,
THANK YOU! I have been using your Finger Friends and Finger Grippers for about 10 weeks. They have made a huge change in my golf swing, as I don't have to worry about the pain in my right ring finger. I had developed a hard callous on the knuckle, and was changing my swing to accommodate the pain. They are easy to slip on, and stay in place. If it gets wet, it dries quickly, or I turn it inside out and still have protection. I wear another on my middle finger, due to a strain I developed some years ago. I keep several Prene Products in my golf bag so they are always within reach. My golf friends ask if they replace tape and band aids and the answer is yes - I'll never go back to those again! I like that there are a variety of sizes available, as they make great gifts for men and women. Did they help me win the club championship this summer? Quite possibly!! Thank you for creating this wonderful product!!

Dear preneproducts,
I just orderd another set. I cannot thank you enough. This is such a unique and high quality product; I have severe arthritis that leaves my fingers bent and sore. Blisters form all too easily. Bandaids come off from sweat and everything else I have tried either slipped off and/or failed to provide protection, and is comfortable. And best of all it does not affect the grip, the feel of the clubs, or the shot making.
 
Sincere thanks for offering such an awesome product.
 
One VERY satisfied customer,
Jim Wilson
Lakeland, Florida
