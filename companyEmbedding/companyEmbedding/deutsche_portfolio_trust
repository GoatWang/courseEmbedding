Money Market Funds





Yields fluctuate and are not guaranteed. Money market 7-day current yield is the annualized net investment per share for the period shown. The compound yield is calculated similarly but when annualized, the income earned by an investment in the fund is assumed to be reinvested. Gains and losses are not included. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the total return quotation. The nonsubsidized yield reflects what the yield would have been had a fee and/or expense waiver not been in place during the period shown. The fees and/or expenses have been waived in an effort to increase the fund’s net yield. 
Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal fluctuate so your shares may be worth more or less when redeemed. Current performance may differ from the data shown. Adjusted returns reflect the maximum sales charge. Unadjusted returns do not reflect sales charges and would have been lower if they did. For the fund's most recent month-end performance, click the "performance" tab below. Current performance may differ from the data shown.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 .00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. You should not rely on or expect the Advisor to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the fund's $1.00 share price. The credit quality of the fund's holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the fund's share price. The fund's share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. The actions of a few large investors in one class of shares of the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the share prices of all classes of shares of the fund. See the prospectus for specific details regarding the fund's risk profile. 

Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PS*Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PRS*  Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional MGD* * This is a sub-group of the Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional class. The legacy share class reference is maintained only for recordkeeping, operational convenience and efficiency.
For the above funds  the advisor has agreed to waive expenses. If the advisor had not waived expenses, yields would have been lower. Recent and any future declines in interest rate levels could cause these funds' earnings to fall below the funds' expense ratio, resulting in a negative yield. The advisor has agreed to voluntarily waive expenses as necessary to maintain a positive yield. This waiver may be changed or terminated at any time without notice.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest. 
Nothing contained herein is fiduciary or impartial investment advice that is individualized or directed to any plan, plan participant, or IRA owner regarding the advisability of any investment transaction, including any IRA distribution or rollover.

Investment Portfolio




                            Investment Portfolio section offers a comprehensive view of your entire investment portfolio.

Portfolio Analysis* #


                            Get an in-depth analysis of your investment holdings across all portfolios. This includes your holdings across different portfolios in different dimensions like asset class, industry, currency, region, market capitalization and product category.
                          

Portfolio Simulator**


                            The simulator is a scenario planning module which provides assistance in analyzing an Investment Portfolio. It illustrates the impact of a restructured portfolio. It facilitates mock investments on customers’ portfolios and immediately shows the results - in terms of various parameters such as asset allocation, industry and market capitalization (for equity component), instrument analysis group etc.
                          

Portfolio Performance*


                            Portfolio Performance helps you track returns on your investments and analyze the performance of your investments on a regular basis.

                            You can track the Portfolio Performance under 3 categories:
                          

Portfolio Type (e.g. Deutsche Bank branch portfolio)
                            
Instrument Group (e.g. debt long term or equity diversified large cap category)
                            
Asset Class (e.g. equity or debt).
                            


                            You can also monitor and analyze your investment portfolio, based on its composition across different dimensions like asset class, industry, market capitalization, product category etc., online. It will also facilitate decision making through what-if analysis across multiple dimensions and provide regular performance updates and transparent portfolio reporting.
                          

*Disclaimer
**This feature is available only for Private Banking customers of Deutsche Bank. Advantage Banking and other customers can contact their Relationship Managers for a portfolio simulator report.

                  Frequently Asked Questions
                



                      Customer Dashboard
                    



                          What is Customer Dashboard? What does it contain?
                        


                            Customer Dashboard is a snapshot of various details like your NetWorth, Recommended Asset Allocation for your risk profile, Actual Asset Allocation, Portfolio Summary, Alerts etc.



                          What would ‘NetWorth’ include?
                        


                            NetWorth would include your Savings / Current account balances, fixed deposits, loans, and investment portfolio.



                          What is meant by the term ‘Portfolio’? Does it include my account balances?
                        


                            Portfolio refers to only Investments done by you. For example, Mutual funds, PMS, Real estate funds etc. It does not include your account balances.



                          What does the Portfolio Summary indicate?
                        


                            Portfolio Summary shows the current market value of your investment portfolios, updated as per their valuation dates. Details like currency of the investment portfolio, current market values and buy costs (purchase price) are also displayed. The total buy cost is the sum of the buy costs of all the securities, across all the instrument types in the portfolio and denominated in the portfolio currency.



                          What are ‘Recommended Asset Allocation for your risk profile' and ‘Actual Asset Allocation’?
                        


                            Recommended Asset Allocation for your risk profile is the percentage allocation of investments in different asset classes as recommended by Deutsche Bank. This asset allocation is based on your risk score (determined by the risk profiler). So, for example if your risk score is aggressive, then the percentage allocation recommended for Equity would be 70%. 
                          

                            Actual Asset Allocation reflects your actual holdings. This can be viewed for your overall portfolio, or for Deutsche Bank Branch Portfolio and db Online, plus Non-Deutsche Bank Portfolio (wherever provided by the customer). For instance, if you hold only debt funds with Deutsche Bank, then the Deutsche Bank Branch Portfolio would show 100% allocation to debt and 0% to Equity.



                          How has my recommended asset allocation been determined? What is the benefit of actual asset allocation?
                        


                            Your recommended asset allocation has been determined based on your risk profile (determined from the inputs given by you in the form of a questionnaire.). This asset allocation is recommended to all clients after assessing their appetite for risk and assigning a risk score. 
                          

                            By viewing your actual asset allocation, you will be able to understand the deviation from the recommended asset classes (equity, debt, liquid or alternative instruments).



                          In the ’Portfolio by Instrument Group’ section, what does Instrument Group mean?
                        


                            Instrument Group is a sub-category of the type of investment done, such as Equity Large Cap, Equity Mid Cap, Debt Long term etc. This gives you an aggregation of your portfolio based on the nature of investments done within the main category of equity, debt, liquid and alternative investments.



                          In what format can I view this section?
                        


                            You have the flexibility to view the graph either as a pie chart or in a tabular form.



                          What is the benefit of setting up Portfolio Alerts?
                        


                            This feature allows customized alerts* so you can stay in touch with specific events/movements in your portfolio. It can either be set by you or through your Relationship Manager.

                          What are System Alerts? Who sets these alerts?

                      Portfolio Overview
                    



                          What is meant by the term ‘Portfolio’? Does it include my account balances?
                        


                            Portfolio refers to only Investments done by you. For example, Mutual funds, PMS, Real estate funds etc. It does not include your account balances.



                          What are the different kinds of portfolios that can be maintained?
                        


                            There are 3 types of portfolios that can be maintained in the system:
                          

Deutsche Bank Branch: This portfolio contains details of investments made through the Bank branch or through your Relationship Manager.
                            
db Online:This portfolio contains details of the Mutual Funds units that you buy / sell through the online channel.
                            
Non-Deutsche Bank Portfolio: In this Portfolio you can maintain and track your investments with other banks / brokers. Please note that Non-Deutsche Bank Portfolio includes all equity share holdings, for all the customers of db TradePro (who use the sharekhan platform to buy / sell equity shares). This information is updated on a daily basis.
                            


                            Please note that the above portfolios are all in single mode. If you need to create db Online Portfolio in non-single mode (either or survivor mode), then please contact the branch staff or your Relationship Manager for the same.



                          What does Portfolio Overview show?
                        


                            Portfolio Overview shows the market value of your investment portfolios, updated as per their valuation dates. For example, all mutual fund schemes values are updated as per the last business day’s Net Asset Value (NAV) as disclosed by the (Asset Management Companies) AMCs. On the other hand, real estate and private equity funds disclose their NAV or Audited Market Value (AMV) only once a year, which is updated accordingly. 
                          

                            The benefit of Portfolio Overview is that it gives a summarized view of your all investment holdings. In this section, each portfolio displayed is a hyperlink, which leads to the various instrument types held within it. Each instrument type (for example, Mutual funds, PMS etc) further leads to the individual holdings / schemes held within that portfolio.



                          Is there an option to search for a particular transaction within any of the 3 portfolios?
                        


                            Yes, a Transaction Search option has been provided within the menu ‘Non-Deutsche Bank Portfolio’*. You can search for a transaction based on several parameters like date range, portfolio type etc. Please note that transactions under Deutsche Bank Branch and db Online are shown only with a view option.
                          

                             
                          


                          What does Portfolio Analysis* show?
                        


                            Portfolio Analysis presents your holdings across the different portfolios in different dimensions such as Asset Class, Industry, Currency, Region, Market capitalization, Instrument Group and Instrument type (to be selected from the drop-down menu ‘Category’). This enables you to carry out an in-depth analysis of your investment holdings across all portfolios. 
                          

                            Please note that parameters like Industry Exposure and Market Capitalization represent analysis only for the equity shares held either directly (in the Non-Deutsche Bank Portfolio) or via the Mutual funds schemes across all portfolios. 
                          

                            This analysis is possible for all the portfolios put together as well as for any single portfolio selected from a drop-down menu ‘Portfolio Type’.

                          What is the use of Portfolio Simulator**?
                        


                            Portfolio Simulator is a scenario planning module which assists you in analyzing an Investment Portfolio and illustrating impact of restructuring the existing investment holdings. It facilitates mock investments on your portfolios and immediately shows the results – in terms of various parameters such as Asset Allocation, Industry and Market Capitalization (for equity component), Instrument Analysis Group etc.  
                          

                            This offers tremendous advantage as customers can test the efficiency of all investment choices made without actually making the investments. 
                          

**Private Banking customers have access to this module themselves. Other customers need to contact their Relationship Manager or Deutsche Bank Branch.





                      Portfolio Performance
                    



                          What does Portfolio Performance show?
                        


                            Portfolio Performance helps you track returns on your investments and analyze the performance of your investments on a regular basis.
                          

                            You can track the Portfolio Performance by 3 categories:
                          

Portfolio Type (e.g. Deutsche Bank Branch Portfolio)
                            
Instrument Group (e.g. Debt Long Term or Equity Diversified Large cap category)
                            
Asset Class (e.g. Equity or Debt).
                            


                            The benefit of this is a summary and detailed analysis of the performance of investment holdings. You can view the Rate of Return (RoR%) for the past 6 months under the ‘Monthly’ tab and for the past 5 years under the ‘Yearly’ tab.



                          How is the Rate of Return (RoR%) calculated in Portfolio Performance?
                        


                            The ROR (Annualised) since investment date has been calculated by using XIRR method. The XIRR or Extended Internal Rate of Return is a method where all the future cash flows are first discounted at a discount rate and then the IRR is calculated. 
                          

                            The RORs (Annualised) for other durations i.e. month to date, 6 months to date, year to date and 5 years to date are computed using True Time Weighted method.



                          What does Performance Analysis section show?
                        


                            The Performance Analysis section displays the following details for various portfolios (i.e. Deutsche Bank Branch, db Online and Non-Deutsche Bank):
                          

Buy Cost: This displays the sum of the buy costs of all schemes / products in a particular portfolio.
                            
Realized Gain / Loss: This displays the sum of all gains / losses that have already occurred on redemption / switch of schemes / products.
                            
Dividend Interest: This displays the sum of all the dividend / interest received for all schemes / products in a particular portfolio, since inception of the portfolio. Please note that this is not just for the current holdings in the portfolio.
                            
Urealized Gain / Loss: This displays the notional gains / losses that would be realized if the schemes / products held in the portfolio were sold at the market price.
                            
Last Transaction Date: This is the date corresponding to last transaction for a particular  portfolio.
                            



                          Where does clicking on a particular portfolio hyperlink (in the Performance Analysis section ) lead to?
                        


                            When the hyperlink for any portfolio is clicked, the performance analysis and returns are shown for various scheme / products held in the corresponding portfolio. The Overview shows Buy Cost, Market Value, Realized / Unrealized Gain / Loss and Since Inception ROR across products / schemes.

                      Portfolio Alerts
                    



                          What is the benefit of setting up Portfolio Alerts?
                        


                            This feature allows customized alerts* so you can stay in touch with specific events/movements in your portfolio. It can either be set by you or through your Relationship Manager. 
                          

*This facility is available only to Private Banking and Advantage Banking customers.
                          


                          What are the different types of portfolio alerts that can be set up?
                        


                            The screen is divided into two sections: Display and Maintenance section. The Maintenance section enables the user to set up the alerts for different categories as Portfolio, Instrument, Exposure, Instrument Price and Reminder.
                          

Portfolio: Here, alerts defined in this category would help you track the performance of a particular portfolio.
                            
Instrument: These alerts enable you to track the performance of a product that you hold  in a particular portfolio.
                            
Exposure: The alert for a particular exposure get triggered when the percentage of holdings as per a particular parameter (such as Industry, Currency, Region, Market Capitalization etc) meets the set criteria.
                            
Instrument Price: Here, you can define an alert on the basis of market price variation for a particular product. The alerts in this category can be set up on the basis of
                              - Amount: alert set to track the product amount below or above the certain amount.
                              - Price%: alert set to track the increase or decrease in product price percentage.
                            
Reminder: This alert is set as a reminder on a particular date.
                            



                          If I set up an alert, when would it show on my dashboard. Also, how long it would remain there?
                        


                            An alert would show on the dashboard only when it meets the set criteria and get triggered. All alerts generated by you (but not triggered) would not show on the dashboard but in the portfolio alerts set-up screen.
                          

                            If a portfolio alert is due to expire (i.e. it has not been triggered for 90 days), you would get a notification message 5 days prior to expiry of an alert.

                            Wealth builders are tools that help you predict and calculate investment and expected returns:
                          

Lumpsum Investment: This tool helps you in compounding a single investment over a period of time assuming a certain return and inflation rate.
                            
Lumpsum and Periodic Investment: This is the same as above, but incorporates periodic investments as well. For example, you can calculate the cumulative returns on  your monthly SIP of Rs 10,000 into a particular investment after 5 years , assuming a certain rate of return.

Retirement Planning: This incorporates a simple discounting formula, and enables you to figure how much a particular lumpsum investment for retirement would allow you to withdraw yearly, assuming a certain return and inflation rate.
                            



                          What is the purpose of Risk Profiler?

                            If you feel your lifestyle and financial considerations have changed considerably, you can review and revise your risk profile online at any point of time.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest. 
Nothing contained herein is fiduciary or impartial investment advice that is individualized or directed to any plan, plan participant, or IRA owner regarding the advisability of any investment transaction, including any IRA distribution or rollover.
