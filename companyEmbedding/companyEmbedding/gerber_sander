Overview


Firm History


Team


Leadership







Sander R. Gerber Chief Executive Officer / Chief Investment OfficerMr. Gerber is Hudson Bay's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer.  He also functions as a Portfolio Manager who opportunistically invests in special situations in addition to monitoring and hedging tail risks.  Mr. Gerber has over 24 years of investing experience in multiple securities classes and derivatives across a broad range of strategies. In 1991, he became a member of the American Stock Exchange, acting as an options market maker. The experience Mr. Gerber gained on the AMEX in managing risk, pricing complicated derivatives and identifying profitable strategies, as well as efficiently managing trade execution and clearing costs, enabled him to leave the floor in 1995 to explore opportunities using his proprietary capital in other markets. In 1997, he founded Gerber Asset Management LLC (“GAM”) to develop and engage in proprietary investment strategies, many of which are utilized by Hudson Bay today. In 2005, assisted by certain key employees of GAM, Mr. Gerber founded Hudson Bay which absorbed GAM's business and 15 employees.

                President Bush to Appoint Sander Gerber
to Wilson Center Board              


 Feb 14, 2006                  











WASHINGTON – President George W. Bush announced that he intends to appoint Sander Ross Gerber, of New York, to be a member of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars for the remainder of a six-year term expiring October 23, 2008. Gerber expressed his pleasure about the appointment. "The Wilson Center is unique in that it provides a non-partisan forum for policymakers and policy experts," Gerber said. "It is a great honor for me to serve as Trustee alongside distinguished colleagues under Lee Hamilton's directorship to foster the Center's ultimate mission of making the world a better place through scholarship and dialogue."Sander Gerber is the Chairman and CEO of Hudson Bay Capital Management LLC, a New York-based Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund. He is also the chairman and CEO of the XTF Group, which seeks to transform the way Americans invest by guiding them into exchange traded funds. Mr. Gerber was president of the Gerber Capital Management Group, a New York City-based investment firm founded in 1997. Previously, he worked as an Options Market Maker on the American Stock Exchange and as an associate consultant at the management consulting firm Bain and Company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
