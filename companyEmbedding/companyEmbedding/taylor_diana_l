Early life[edit]
Taylor was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the daughter of Lois Johnston (O'Neill) and Edwin Douglas Taylor.[citation needed] Her father was a Union Carbide biochemist and her mother a schoolteacher.[1] Taylor stated in a New York Times article, "Growing up, I imagined I would come to New York, get married, move to the suburbs and have kids. It just didn’t happen that way."[2] She attended Milton Academy, then went on to earn an A.B. in economics from Dartmouth College, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.[3]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Dartmouth, Taylor moved to New York City and obtained a job at the Department of Social Services.[1] Realizing that it was not the job she wanted, she applied to business school in a joint degree program that also included a public health degree.[1] While in business school, she worked nights and weekends as an administrator at St. Vincent's Hospital in Brooklyn and also worked at Smith Barney in its public finance department.[1] She received an offer for a full-time job at Smith Barney when she graduated from Columbia.[1] She then moved on to Lehman Brothers, followed by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.[1]
In 1996, Taylor launched a career in the public sector and became assistant secretary to then Governor George Pataki.[1] After briefly working for Keyspan Energy and serving as the chief financial officer of the Long Island Power Authority, she returned to Governor Pataki's Office as deputy secretary.[1] She first oversaw the state's authorities for Pataki and then moved to become his chief advisor on finance and housing issues.[citation needed]
In 2003, Pataki nominated her as New York State Superintendent of Banks, a cabinet position.[1] In this position, Taylor was the head of the New York State Banking Department and Chairwoman of the New York State Banking Board. While at the department she received praise for policing fraud in low-income communities and overhauling the department structure.[citation needed] She also focused on utilizing banks for economic development in low-income communities in New York State.[citation needed]
In 2007, she left public service to become managing director at Wolfensohn Fund Management.[1]
Taylor serves on the board of ACCION International, a microfinancing organization, and in June 2011 was named to the board of the YMCA of Greater New York.[1] She is also a director of Sotheby's, Citigroup, and Brookfield Properties.[1]
In 2014, Taylor began serving as Vice Chairman of Solera Capital,[4] a women-owned private equity firm based in New York City that is grounded in the belief that companies have the power to shape the world and to inspire solutions, while achieving business success.
FDIC Chairmanship[edit]
It was rumored that Taylor would be nominated by George W. Bush as the Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), but Taylor was never offered the job. Reports said that Taylor had undergone a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and had finished the White House paperwork for the position. The reports also said that Bush aides were informing U.S. Senate leaders about the nomination and that it would be announced in a few days.[citation needed]
As Mayor Bloomberg unveiled a second-term agenda with an increased focus on gun control, more rumors came about suggesting that pressure from the National Rifle Association had caused President Bush not to nominate Taylor. Following the withdrawal of her nomination, Bloomberg cancelled a scheduled appearance at a White House dinner, which would feature the Dance Theatre of Harlem. He instead attended a community meeting in the Bronx.[citation needed]
Taylor's only public comments on the FDIC affair were made at the January meeting of the New York State Banking Board and in an interview with the New York Times.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Bloomberg and Taylor at a 2006 gala


Taylor, a divorcee with no children,[5] met Bloomberg at a Citizens Budget Commission event in 2000, where they were seated together. Since then the couple has been together and she acted as an unofficial first lady for the city during Bloomberg's mayorship, joining him at social functions and campaigning with him. She has been frequently seen marching with him in parades citywide. During the 2005 New York City transit strike, Taylor stayed with Bloomberg in the city's Office of Emergency Management headquarters in Brooklyn each night of the strike. During his second inauguration in 2006, Taylor occupied a front row seat with the mayor's mother and daughters. The two live together in Bloomberg's East 79th Street townhouse.[2]
Both have denied any intentions of marrying.[citation needed]
Potential 2012 Senate race/civic posts[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2012
In July 2010, Taylor stated that she believed she would have defeated Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand had she run for Gillibrand's U.S. Senate seat that year.[6] However, she ultimately decided not to enter the race.[7] Taylor then commented that she was considering running in 2012.[8]
In her civic life, Taylor serves on non-profit and corporate boards that include The New York Women's Foundation, YMCA of Greater New York, ACCION, Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, Sotheby's, Citigroup, Brookfield Properties and her alma mater Dartmouth[1]

A Mayor by Her Side, but Politics Woos Her, Too

The two Republican political operatives had come from Washington to see whether Diana L. Taylor would consider running for the United States Senate. It did not take much prodding.Ms. Taylor, the companion of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was not only intrigued by the idea, but also eager to delve into the details of a potential campaign and future career in the Senate. She mused about how much influence she could have as a freshman Republican in a Democratic-controlled Congress, and the kind of relationship she would have with the state’s senior senator, Charles E. Schumer.“She was very serious about it,” said Bill Paxon, a Republican former congressman from New York, who participated in the previously undisclosed meeting in March  at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manhattan.Ms. Taylor, 55, a woman known best not for what she has done, but for whom she lives with, is beginning to make unmistakable forays into New York politics, shedding her reputation as a glamorous sidekick and becoming closely watched in her own right. Her actions suggest that as Mr. Bloomberg enters the twilight of his mayoralty, the heir to his political legacy may be the woman he has dated for a decade.  “If she wants it, she has a political future,” said John J. Faso, the Republican candidate for governor in 2006.

Not everyone was enthusiastic about the Senate idea: Mr. Bloomberg expressed reservations about her running, according to those close to the couple, in part because of the inevitable awkwardness that would accompany a senator and a mayor living under the same roof.

Ms. Taylor ultimately decided to forgo the campaign against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, though she intensely debated it with friends and advisers and quietly traveled to Washington to talk it over with the Republican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, before making up her mind.She is now advising a young Democratic upstart, Reshma Saujani, in her campaign to oust an 18-year incumbent congresswoman, Carolyn B. Maloney, who represents the Upper East Side.Republican lawmakers, consultants and operatives continue to describe Ms. Taylor — a former investment banker and state banking regulator — as a “perfect candidate,” a “grand-slam home run” and a “shoo-in” for offices ranging from governor to mayor of New York.Their enthusiasm, as overheated as it may seem, can be traced to her eclectic résumé and a personal warmth that seems to stand out all the more against Mr. Bloomberg’s sometimes chilly demeanor. (Even now, the mayor seems to recognize her popularity as a humanizing force. To demonstrate how safe city parks had become under his leadership, he told reporters this week: “My girlfriend goes and walks the dogs at 1 in the morning” in Central Park.)The daughter of a biochemist, who grew up in Old Greenwich, Conn., Ms. Taylor attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, Dartmouth College and Columbia University; started her career as an investment banker at Smith Barney; and decided, midcareer, to try government work. As an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, she oversaw New York state’s sprawling public authorities system, and in 2003  was named superintendent of banking, with authority over thousands of financial institutions.

She has mixed with global leaders in the fight against poverty as the chairwoman of Accion, a leading microfinance lender, which has disbursed more than $23 billion around the globe. Speaking before her group in Ghana, the rock star and human rights activist Bono once cooed: “Diana, you know how I feel about you. But don’t tell the mayor.”Despite her ties to Wall Street, she emerged as an exacting watchdog as banking superintendent. Many of her crusades now seem prescient: She vigorously opposed a 2004 decision that allowed banks like J. P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings to escape state supervision. Her argument was that local authorities could spot abuses that their federal counterparts missed.

In 2006, two years before the housing market imploded, Ms. Taylor gave a speech warning that mortgage brokers were peddling exotic products to unsophisticated consumers that “hide or bury information about the real terms of the loan.”Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions in the Obama administration, said, “She was one of the early people pointing out the need to take action.”By day, Ms. Taylor hounded wayward check-cashing firms and money-transfer agents. By night, she inhabited the glittery world of black-tie charity balls, appearing on red carpets in body-hugging gowns by Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Rucci, and drawing the admiration of the Vogue editor Anna Wintour.“She has a wonderful style, which everyone notices, but underneath it, she is a very tough woman — fair, but tough,” said John P. Cahill, a former top aide to Mr. Pataki.

Her work for Mr. Pataki drew the attention of Republican insiders; both candidates who sought the party’s 2006 nomination for governor, Mr. Faso and William F. Weld, confirmed in recent interviews that they separately asked her to be their running mate. That same year, the Bush administration considered nominating her to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.She left the Pataki administration in 2007, but her credibility with regulators has helped her navigate a new role she took on last July, as a member of the board of directors at Citigroup, where she has helped repair the bank’s relationship with F.D.I.C. officials.Neither Ms. Taylor nor Mr. Bloomberg agreed to comment for this article, and details of her flirtation with a Senate run have remained hidden.It began, according to those involved in the discussions, around the end of February, when Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from New York, raised the idea during a telephone call to Ms. Taylor.

Washington Republicans were convinced that Ms. Gillibrand, who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David A. Paterson, was vulnerable, and they were determined to recruit a formidable challenger. Ms. Molinari, the wife of Mr. Paxon, had no doubt: Ms. Taylor could win. She had seen her work the crowds at parades in Brooklyn and Staten Island and charm the city’s biggest donors at the mayor’s town house.

Ms. Taylor agreed to travel to Washington, to meet with Senator Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Mr. McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Both senators encouraged her to run, pointing to her background in finance and her experience as a banking regulator.Republican-sponsored polling revealed her potential attraction to both New York’s upstate conservatives and its downstate liberals, and her place at the top of the city’s social pyramid seemed to bode well for fund-raising.Back in New York in March, Ms. Taylor arranged to speak with Mr. Paxon and his former chief of staff, Michael Hook, now a Republican political consultant. She impressed them with her command of the state’s byzantine political system, rattling off the names of local party officials and far-flung flyspeck towns “This wasn’t a situation where you would have to introduce her to that world,” Mr. Paxon said.He recalled assuring her that, if elected, she would immediately become a national Republican figure.Ultimately, however, Ms. Taylor decided that it was not the right time. She was not ready to disentangle herself from a long list of corporate and nonprofit roles, to crisscross the state campaigning nonstop for months or to expose herself to the unforgiving scrutiny of the national news media, which would surely descend on the race.And there was the Bloomberg factor: The two have dated since before he became mayor, and though friends say they have no plans to marry, Ms. Taylor lives with him at his Upper East Side town house and travels with him regularly to his retreats in places like Bermuda and Paris.The mayor expressed misgivings about her running, according to two people who have spoken with the couple and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were intended to be private. A spokesman for the mayor declined to comment. But those close to the couple say that having a mayor of New York romantically involved with a senator who could influence the flow of billions of dollars to the city would create a potentially problematic situation.Furthermore, the mayor, who prides himself on his political independence, might suddenly find himself asked about matters like his companion’s policy positions and whether her campaign donors were seeking to influence city government. A registered Republican, Ms. Taylor embraces a philosophy that closely mirrors that of the mayor. She is socially progressive and fiscally conservative. She is fond of invoking Abraham Lincoln on the role of government (which she has paraphrased as “to do for those who cannot do so well for themselves”), and she is infuriated by those who complain about Washington but do not have the stomach to become involved in public life.She also shares Mr. Bloomberg’s suspicions of career politicians. She has privately grumbled that some members of Congress have been in place too long and have “forgotten why they are there,” according to a colleague who speaks with her on a regular basis. That complaint seemed to spill into public view when she endorsed Ms. Maloney’s opponent, Ms. Saujani, and wrote her a $1,000 campaign check this spring — Ms. Taylor’s first donation to a candidate. Since then, she has spoken regularly with Ms. Saujani about economic policy and campaign strategy.

Her advice: “Don’t be a politician. Be a leader,” the candidate said in an interview.Friends suspect she will eventually take her own advice. Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to leave office in three years, clearing the way for Ms. Taylor, who would still be under 60, to run for office. “I get the sense,” said Mr. Cahill, the former Pataki aide, “that she would really like to do it.”

Early life[edit]
Taylor was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the daughter of Lois Johnston (O'Neill) and Edwin Douglas Taylor.[citation needed] Her father was a Union Carbide biochemist and her mother a schoolteacher.[1] Taylor stated in a New York Times article, "Growing up, I imagined I would come to New York, get married, move to the suburbs and have kids. It just didn’t happen that way."[2] She attended Milton Academy, then went on to earn an A.B. in economics from Dartmouth College, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.[3]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Dartmouth, Taylor moved to New York City and obtained a job at the Department of Social Services.[1] Realizing that it was not the job she wanted, she applied to business school in a joint degree program that also included a public health degree.[1] While in business school, she worked nights and weekends as an administrator at St. Vincent's Hospital in Brooklyn and also worked at Smith Barney in its public finance department.[1] She received an offer for a full-time job at Smith Barney when she graduated from Columbia.[1] She then moved on to Lehman Brothers, followed by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.[1]
In 1996, Taylor launched a career in the public sector and became assistant secretary to then Governor George Pataki.[1] After briefly working for Keyspan Energy and serving as the chief financial officer of the Long Island Power Authority, she returned to Governor Pataki's Office as deputy secretary.[1] She first oversaw the state's authorities for Pataki and then moved to become his chief advisor on finance and housing issues.[citation needed]
In 2003, Pataki nominated her as New York State Superintendent of Banks, a cabinet position.[1] In this position, Taylor was the head of the New York State Banking Department and Chairwoman of the New York State Banking Board. While at the department she received praise for policing fraud in low-income communities and overhauling the department structure.[citation needed] She also focused on utilizing banks for economic development in low-income communities in New York State.[citation needed]
In 2007, she left public service to become managing director at Wolfensohn Fund Management.[1]
Taylor serves on the board of ACCION International, a microfinancing organization, and in June 2011 was named to the board of the YMCA of Greater New York.[1] She is also a director of Sotheby's, Citigroup, and Brookfield Properties.[1]
In 2014, Taylor began serving as Vice Chairman of Solera Capital,[4] a women-owned private equity firm based in New York City that is grounded in the belief that companies have the power to shape the world and to inspire solutions, while achieving business success.
FDIC Chairmanship[edit]
It was rumored that Taylor would be nominated by George W. Bush as the Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), but Taylor was never offered the job. Reports said that Taylor had undergone a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and had finished the White House paperwork for the position. The reports also said that Bush aides were informing U.S. Senate leaders about the nomination and that it would be announced in a few days.[citation needed]
As Mayor Bloomberg unveiled a second-term agenda with an increased focus on gun control, more rumors came about suggesting that pressure from the National Rifle Association had caused President Bush not to nominate Taylor. Following the withdrawal of her nomination, Bloomberg cancelled a scheduled appearance at a White House dinner, which would feature the Dance Theatre of Harlem. He instead attended a community meeting in the Bronx.[citation needed]
Taylor's only public comments on the FDIC affair were made at the January meeting of the New York State Banking Board and in an interview with the New York Times.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Bloomberg and Taylor at a 2006 gala


Taylor, a divorcee with no children,[5] met Bloomberg at a Citizens Budget Commission event in 2000, where they were seated together. Since then the couple has been together and she acted as an unofficial first lady for the city during Bloomberg's mayorship, joining him at social functions and campaigning with him. She has been frequently seen marching with him in parades citywide. During the 2005 New York City transit strike, Taylor stayed with Bloomberg in the city's Office of Emergency Management headquarters in Brooklyn each night of the strike. During his second inauguration in 2006, Taylor occupied a front row seat with the mayor's mother and daughters. The two live together in Bloomberg's East 79th Street townhouse.[2]
Both have denied any intentions of marrying.[citation needed]
Potential 2012 Senate race/civic posts[edit]

In July 2010, Taylor stated that she believed she would have defeated Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand had she run for Gillibrand's U.S. Senate seat that year.[6] However, she ultimately decided not to enter the race.[7] Taylor then commented that she was considering running in 2012.[8]
In her civic life, Taylor serves on non-profit and corporate boards that include The New York Women's Foundation, YMCA of Greater New York, ACCION, Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, Sotheby's, Citigroup, Brookfield Properties and her alma mater Dartmouth[1]

Early life[edit]
Taylor was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the daughter of Lois Johnston (O'Neill) and Edwin Douglas Taylor.[citation needed] Her father was a Union Carbide biochemist and her mother a schoolteacher.[1] Taylor stated in a New York Times article, "Growing up, I imagined I would come to New York, get married, move to the suburbs and have kids. It just didn’t happen that way."[2] She attended Milton Academy, then went on to earn an A.B. in economics from Dartmouth College, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.[3]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Dartmouth, Taylor moved to New York City and obtained a job at the Department of Social Services.[1] Realizing that it was not the job she wanted, she applied to business school in a joint degree program that also included a public health degree.[1] While in business school, she worked nights and weekends as an administrator at St. Vincent's Hospital in Brooklyn and also worked at Smith Barney in its public finance department.[1] She received an offer for a full-time job at Smith Barney when she graduated from Columbia.[1] She then moved on to Lehman Brothers, followed by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.[1]
In 1996, Taylor launched a career in the public sector and became assistant secretary to then Governor George Pataki.[1] After briefly working for Keyspan Energy and serving as the chief financial officer of the Long Island Power Authority, she returned to Governor Pataki's Office as deputy secretary.[1] She first oversaw the state's authorities for Pataki and then moved to become his chief advisor on finance and housing issues.[citation needed]
In 2003, Pataki nominated her as New York State Superintendent of Banks, a cabinet position.[1] In this position, Taylor was the head of the New York State Banking Department and Chairwoman of the New York State Banking Board. While at the department she received praise for policing fraud in low-income communities and overhauling the department structure.[citation needed] She also focused on utilizing banks for economic development in low-income communities in New York State.[citation needed]
In 2007, she left public service to become managing director at Wolfensohn Fund Management.[1]
Taylor serves on the board of ACCION International, a microfinancing organization, and in June 2011 was named to the board of the YMCA of Greater New York.[1] She is also a director of Sotheby's, Citigroup, and Brookfield Properties.[1]
In 2014, Taylor began serving as Vice Chairman of Solera Capital,[4] a women-owned private equity firm based in New York City that is grounded in the belief that companies have the power to shape the world and to inspire solutions, while achieving business success.

The Mayor's Lady, Her Own Woman, One and the Same

She has been the other half of New York's ultimate power couple. By day, she regulates thousands of institutions in the nation's financial capital while he owns a multibillion-dollar business and runs a world-class city. By night, she is his much-photographed partner in the glittering social swirl. And during crises like a transit strike, she too hunkers down in the city's emergency command center.If New York prides itself on being an American city unlike any other, its de facto first lady, Diana L. Taylor, embodies that spirit. A powerful woman with her own litany of accomplishments, she breaks the mold of more traditional political couples with her unconventional long-term relationship with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.And recently, Ms. Taylor, who is the state's banking superintendent, has found herself in an uncomfortable spotlight. Chosen by the White House to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, she had made it through several layers of scrutiny when her nomination collapsed for reasons that remain mysterious to this day.But if that episode created private difficulties for Ms. Taylor, it also highlighted the singular position she holds in the life of the city.

"We all have friends and know important people whose spouses or significant others are not as important as they are, and this is a slightly sticky social wicket," said the gossip columnist Liz Smith, noting how people in polite society do not want to make a fuss "over the famous one and ignore the other one."

"But she doesn't produce that effect because she seems so secure in her own right," she continued. "She's not the little woman looking up at him -- it's not like Nancy and Ronnie."A woman who is far more animated discussing the arcana of the assessment of fees for her department's services than her famous relationship, Ms. Taylor is indeed secure in her own right. With a privileged Old Greenwich, Conn., upbringing, she already holds a few Ivy League degrees and is on her way to another, this one in public health. Beginning on Wall Street, she has built a high-profile career that includes, according to her peers, an overhaul of a once-moribund State Banking Department."She's smart, and that always helps, she's a hard worker, she understands financial transactions and she understands priorities," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who has worked with Ms. Taylor to prosecute fraudulent check-cashing businesses.At the same time, her relationship with the mayor is something of a novelty in government circles, blending the rituals of a traditional political spouse with the contemporary realities of a postfeminist, post-sexual-revolution era.She is a frequent presence at Mr. Bloomberg's official and social events, welcoming guests to his Upper East Side town house when he runs late, hovering in the background at weekend news conferences and hopping from one stop to another throughout the city during campaign season."It's wonderful watching somebody who's so good at what he does do his thing," she said in an interview last week, adding that she gets to meet interesting people that way, too. "I'm really proud of him and I love being part of it."Still, the question arises: after nearly six years of dating and with all they have in common, why have the two, who are both divorced, not married? Although Mr. Bloomberg, who declined to comment for this article, has been known in private to make "take my girlfriend please" type remarks (joking, for instance, that Gov. George E. Pataki should move the Banking Department to Buffalo), in public he appears devoted to his significant other. Last week he told reporters that he was skipping a White House banquet to celebrate Ms. Taylor's 51st birthday, saying, "that has to be a very high priority on my list of things to do."

For Ms. Taylor's part, a mention of the M-word causes her to purse her lips as if she had just swallowed cough syrup. "It's been five and half years, it's great," she said, grimacing at saying even that much.Ms. Taylor is much livelier when speaking of just about anything else, like her work bringing banks to low-income neighborhoods that have none. Or the problems consumers face when banks, without notice, cover customers' overdrafts but then charge usurious surprise fees.Or when she discusses her past, like how when she was 9, she ignored her father's warning and her boat capsized in frigid January waters. (Her father refused to sail with her again for a decade, she said, laughing.) Or when she discusses her regrets about not having children of her own."I have two wonderful nephews," she said, showing a silver-lining approach that she appears to take to adversity. "They are so cute, oh my God, they are just precious. I love visiting them."

Although her family is mainly from Canada, Ms. Taylor has some roots in New York: a great-grandfather, who was involved in financing the Spence School on the Upper East Side, had a Wall Street investment bank that Ms. Taylor believes went out of business during the Depression. Her parents came to the United States when her father went to Wharton business school. Her father worked as a biochemist at Union Carbide in New York, settling the family in Connecticut.Ms. Taylor, the oldest of three siblings, grew up with many of the trappings of old-money privilege. She began skiing at 2, raced sailboats, rowed crew and played tennis and lacrosse. She attended a steady stream of prestigious institutions including Greenwich Country Day School, the Milton Academy, Greenwich High School, Dartmouth and Columbia. And she went straight to work on Wall Street, first at Smith Barney after completing her masters in business administration.But she did not limit herself to the financial world. In business school, she worked part time at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, and she is now on track to complete a masters at Columbia in public health, a field she plans to work in someday.She also has worked for the Long Island Power Authority and KeySpan Energy and sits on several boards of nonprofit institutions.Ms. Taylor's current employer, the Banking Department, regulates the mortgage industry, credit unions and money service businesses like check-cashers and money transfer agents in addition to banks.

Since being appointed superintendent by Governor Pataki in 2003, she has increased the policing of the money service businesses, which can become outlets for tax evasion, money laundering and the financing of terror.She has also worked to educate consumers about the perils lurking in those businesses especially in communities across the state where they frequently are used in place of banks."You're really looking at a clientele that is for the most part not wealthy, they're living in areas that are under-banked, they are probably immigrants," she said. "They're the most vulnerable of the population, and these institutions provide a needed service. And so it's up to us to make sure that the services that are provided are what they think they're getting."When Mr. Pataki appointed her to the banking position, there were rumblings that it was a political move prompted by her Bloomberg connection, but she has, by most accounts, proven her ability to do the job.But for all her work in the banking field, it is her relationship with the mayor that gets the most attention, and that association has made her a frequent presence on the society pages. The fashion world has taken note of her, too."I had always been intrigued by her style and her poise and her intelligence," said Anna Wintour, who featured Ms. Taylor in Vogue after getting to know her through another mother at Spence, where Ms. Wintour's daughter attended. "Often when you see women in political office or similar kinds of roles, they feel like they always have to wear a boring suit, or a pants suit, nothing that's going to rock the boat. She obviously doesn't have that fear of fashion."Even though both Ms. Taylor and Mr. Bloomberg avoid discussing their relationship (the picture she keeps of them on her office desk faces her, not her visitors), it has played out in public from the beginning: They met when Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy group, seated the two next to each other at an event.And while the mayor has said that he is philosophically opposed to a second marriage, he is willing to make the occasional significant gesture signaling the depth of their relationship. This year, it was Ms. Taylor who sat in the front row at his inauguration; in 2002, it was Susan Bloomberg, whom he divorced in 1993.Indeed, Ms. Taylor does not shy away from the spotlight, although the attention is not necessarily always welcome. As her nomination to the F.D.I.C. fizzled and became fodder for speculation that anger at Mr. Bloomberg from interests like the National Rifle Association or the tobacco lobby had killed it, she addressed it publicly only to a point.She clearly preferred to let it go and move on, fueled by a kind of optimistic fatalism that she sees even in the frustrations of learning to golf.

"You think you've got it and then you lose it," she said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work," she continued, starting to laugh, "and you think you're in control and you're not." Continue reading the main story
