Maximized Living offers a variety of opportunities to all principled chiropractors
MLX is a principle-driven chiropractic seminar that‚Äôs open to all chiropractors and students.
 With world-class speakers from across the profession and industry-leaders hosting specialized training sessions ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much to learn and only 3 days to take it all in.
Own Your Future Now
Maximized Living is the vision of two extremely committed and talented chiropractic doctors, Dr. Ben Lerner and Dr. Greg Loman, who set out to change the world. Their dream was twofold: first, to bring health and well-being to the world by changing the way people view and manage their lives, and second, create a sustainable clinic business and operations model that allows highly trained doctors of chiropractic to live out their purpose and passion.
Chiropractic: An Industry in Transition
The number of chiropractic doctors that leave the profession simply because they cannot afford to remain in it is, frankly, frightening. Comparing the investment of education alone that chiropractors have to make to the average chiropractic salaries paints a fairly depressing picture. Dr. Lerner and Dr. Loman vowed to do something on a global scale to support and grow these practices. This something eventually turned into Maximized Living.
Join a Growth-Focused, Mission-Driven Community
You chose a chiropractic career for a reason, and it‚Äôs about more than just relieving pain. You want to change lives, improve futures, and help your patients unlock total wellness in important new ways. The realities of your business, however, do not always make it easy to build a successful, sustainable practice that aligns with your vision and values.
This is what Maximized Living is all about. We bring the experience and expertise of the smartest, most successful providers in the field to the challenges of your practice. You are supported by expert coaches who share insights and best practices to get you to that next level.

Student Programs designed to help students graduate ready to tackle the challenges of building a business and a mission.
Partnership Development Programs that help train existing doctors on the Maximized Living approach to chiropractic and integrated wellness through The 5 Essentials.
Maximized Living Health Center franchises give doctors an opportunity to own their own MLHC, bringing the best in care to their patients and practice.

No matter which path you take, you‚Äôll get a partner dedicated to building shared success. Combine this commitment with deep expertise and a robust ecosystem of resources designed for education, engagement, and advocacy, and the Maximized Living advantage means big benefits for you, your patients, and your practice.

Reduce time and money spent on your clinic.
Manage your practice through a team, so you have a business and not a job.
Reduce the stress on you and your team.
Collaborate with like-minded doctors and partners.
Ignite and fuel your passion for total wellness.
Transform the way healthcare is understood and delivered.

If you‚Äôre ready to become part of the Maximized Living movement, contact us today to learn more about our programs.
A Vision-Driven Community
Maximized Living can help students and doctors achieve a career and purpose bringing The 5¬†Essentials to the world through our student, Partner Development, and MLHC programs.
Student Programs 
Imagine¬†building a career that exceeded all your¬†expectations: A life spent healing and transforming lives, a business built on the very best in¬†business and science, a community created around a shared vision of success. With our student programs, this cooperation and collaboration starts when prospective doctors are still in school, helping students answer important questions about their education and future.

How do I build a business after I graduate?
How can I find my purpose and passion as a chiropractor?
What skills do I need to acquire to bring people to health and keep them there?
How can I afford to open and grow a business?
How can I manage all the financial, workforce, and technical challenges of opening a new practice?
How do I build and lead a strong team?
How can I find and attract new patients and grow my practice?

The purpose of our program is to educate, inspire, and empower students to reach their full potential, answering all of the above questions and more. Through training, planning, certification, and mentorship from hundreds of doctors who have achieved the practices of their dreams, students will learn what it takes to run a successful and profitable practice built around The 5 Essentials.
The MLHC Opportunity
Today, we have over 100 Maximized Living Health Center (MLHC) franchises in the United States with many more on their way. MLHCs open up a tremendous opportunity for doctors (and future doctors) like you to not only live the mission of Maximized Living, but also to OWN a part of it. Check out our clinic locations below.
The Results
As a result of our extensive support network, Maximized Living doctors experience incredible results in their clinics, far surpassing the industry averages. With every franchise or affiliate doctor we add, the Maximized Living brand becomes synonymous with health and well-being, transforming more and more patient lives.

  Become A Maximized Living Doctor Now! 

Designed to be a turn-key approach, Maximized Living training combines leadership development, patient education systems, cutting-edge adjusting and spinal correction, nutrition, fitness, detox, and exercise programs into a single, cross-discipline approach. This breakthrough lifestyle design system can help your patients find new health and wellness while making you a trusted medical provider to the community.

Success From the Start

Maximized Living students leave college prepared. As opposed to being filled with fear about paying off student loans and being alone in the profession, these students have invested in their futures with confidence.

Maximized Living gives doctors the support needed to run their businesses effectively. This is especially true for chiropractic students, who must make the difficult choices regarding the future of their life, career, and family. We offer two different tracks, both backed by state of the art expertise and the best coaching resources in the industry.

Our Partner Development Program prepares DC students and new DC applicants for success with coaching, the Maximized Living brand, and high-quality, market-ready supplements and resources.
Our Maximized Living Health Center program delivers this support and more, bringing robust financial and lead generation support.

Colorado Springs, Colo. (PRWEB)
February 11, 2010
 USA Weightlifting is pleased to announce that Maximized Living has been named as the exclusive chiropractic partner of USAW.
Through this partnership, key Maximized Living chiropractors will become members of the USA Weightlifting Wellness Advisory Council.  These doctors, who meet standards established by Maximized Living and the USA Weightlifting Committee, will provide chiropractic services to weightlifting athletes at domestic and international events.
"Maximized Living has more than a thousand doctors throughout the United States and we are looking forward to working with these experienced chiropractors to bring a new aspect of sports performance to our lifters," said USA Weightlifting CEO Rick Adams.
Maximized Living has a long history of working with elite athletes from a wide array of sports and National Governing Bodies, including wrestling and judo.  Through these partnerships, Maximized Living doctors work with coaches, trainers and medical doctors to deliver the most comprehensive and proactive performance program to these leading athletes.
"One of the primary goals of Maximized Living is to get young men and women off the couch, away from their computers, and get them fit. A very key component of measuring good health is your fat to muscle ratio. In a sedentary world, even children have too much fat to muscle and therefore we're experiencing a huge increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease in kids." declared Dr. Ben Lerner, NY Times Best Selling Author and Co-founder of Maximized Living.  "We're certain that by caring for the athletes of USA Weightlifting and encouraging more young people to enter the sport, we're not only helping to create more gold medals, but creating a healthier America."
The outcomes of the program consistently demonstrate:
‚Ä¢Reduced injury rates
‚Ä¢Increased recovery time
‚Ä¢Increased energy and sustained performance
‚Ä¢Enhanced focus and mental clarity
‚Ä¢Extended athlete careers
‚Ä¢Improved training productivity¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
‚Ä¢Winning
"I think it's good to have us show both the corporate and performance related benefits.   In addition to working with USA Weightlifting's world class athletes, we are committed to supporting grass roots efforts in getting our youth and parents engaged in both the sport and the principles of lifelong wellness," said Maximized Living President Shel Hart. "Maximized Living's comprehensive Wellness Programs and experienced network of North American doctors combined with the discipline and physical/mental conditioning through USA Weightlifting are a winning formula."
Maximized Living's vision is to fundamentally change the way people view and manage their health.  Through its' network of 1,000+ doctors, Maximized Living incorporates their "5 Essentials" in promoting holistic wellness programs including: chiropractic care to maximize nerve flow, nutrition, detoxification, exercise and mental well being.

The Recent Launch of Maximized...
Maximized Living's 12 Minute...
Maximized Living Recently Launched...






Celebration, FL (PRWEB)
January 17, 2008
 Maximized Living today announced the launch of their website http://www.12minutemakeover.com that is dedicated to maximizing your workout in just 12 minutes a week.
The real benefit of exercise is what happens as your body responds to exercise -- in other words, what state the exercise leaves you in.  Is it a fat-burning, muscle-building state? A fat-storing, muscle breakdown state? Or no particularly new state at all? 
12minutemakeover.com is focused on "surge" or "burst" training -- a method that leaves your body in a state of muscle building and fat-burning due to its effect on hormone levels. It works by doing intervals of up 3 cycles of 20 seconds "surges" and rest periods followed by 2 minutes of rest.
Significant research from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine also shows that body fat is reduced more substantially by performing high intensity exercise as compared to long, endurance-type exercise.  
Overcoming obstacles means overcoming information we've received from "experts" about exercise that flies in the face of scientific research that shows that high-intensity, short-duration exercise shocks the body into a fat-burning, muscle-building state.
About Maximized Living:
Maximized Living Inc. was established in 1999 and is located in Celebration, Florida, USA. Our company was founded by Dr. Ben Lerner and Dr. Greg Loman. Dr. Lerner is a world-renown chiropractor, two-time New York Times best-selling author, and two-time U.S. Olympic Wrestling Team physician.
