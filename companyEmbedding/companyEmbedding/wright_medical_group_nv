Company Announces Launch of the INVISION™ Total Ankle Revision System -First System Developed Specifically for Total Ankle Revision Arthroplasty

AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands , July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wright Medical Group N.V. (NASDAQ:WMGI) today announced that it will highlight new innovations at the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) 2017 Annual Meeting taking place at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, Washington from July 12-15, 2017. 
Wright will feature its full range of lower extremities and biologics products at exhibit booth #801 and will showcase, for the first time, three important additions to its foot and ankle portfolio:
INVISION™ Total Ankle Revision System - The first and only system developed specifically for total ankle revision arthroplasty, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System provides a unique solution for even the most difficult revision procedures.  Whether leveraged as a standalone construct or in conjunction with INFINITY and INBONETM components, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System is an important addition to the continuum of care from total ankle replacement through any necessary revisions.  The INVISION Total Ankle Revision System helps surgeons re-build bone lost through previous surgeries and provides modularity to help restore natural joint height.
ORTHOLOC™ 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System - The ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System features a complete range of ankle fracture plates designed specifically for the foot and ankle surgeon.  The system features low-profile, anatomic plate designs and ORTHOLOC 3Di polyaxial locking screw technology, providing an innovative fracture solution that addresses a primary need for one of the foot and ankle's largest market segments.
MICA™ Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System - As the first minimally invasive solution specifically designed for foot and ankle surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System provides a minimally disruptive, procedurally integrated solution that features specifically designed implants and instrumentation for percutaneous surgery of the foot.  The MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System can be used to treat multiple pathologies including one of the most common, Hallux Valgus, commonly known as bunions.  Compared to a traditional open surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System has been shown to provide less pain, shorter operative times and improved cosmesis.
Robert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, "We have continued to expand our best-in-class foot and ankle product portfolio to meet the needs of orthopaedic physicians and patients and further extend our leadership position in the fast growing lower extremities and biologics markets.  The launch of our unique INVISION Total Ankle Revision System will expand our leadership in total ankle technology and highlights our ability to address the total ankle replacement continuum of care.  In addition, the ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System and MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System further enhances our offering in the foot and ankle market space and allows for an improved surgical experience."
Wright is also conducting medical education and training courses during the AOFAS annual meeting in its mobile training lab.  These courses will address total ankle arthroplasty, Charcot reconstruction and limb salvage, and ankle and hindfoot fusion using Augment®.  More information on Wright Medical's products can be found at www.wright.com.
Internet Posting of Information
Wright routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the "Investor Relations" section of its website at www.wright.com.  The company encourages investors and potential investors to consult the Wright website regularly for important information about Wright.

Share this story with your networkFacebook0TwitterGoogle+1Pinterest1AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands , July 12, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Wright Medical Group N.V. (NASDAQ:WMGI) today announced that it will highlight new innovations at the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) 2017 Annual Meeting taking place at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, Washington from July 12-15, 2017.
Wright will feature its full range of lower extremities and biologics products at exhibit booth #801 and will showcase, for the first time, three important additions to its foot and ankle portfolio:
INVISION™ Total Ankle Revision System – The first and only system developed specifically for total ankle revision arthroplasty, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System provides a unique solution for even the most difficult revision procedures.  Whether leveraged as a standalone construct or in conjunction with INFINITY and INBONETM components, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System is an important addition to the continuum of care from total ankle replacement through any necessary revisions.  The INVISION Total Ankle Revision System helps surgeons re-build bone lost through previous surgeries and provides modularity to help restore natural joint height.
ORTHOLOC™ 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System – The ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System features a complete range of ankle fracture plates designed specifically for the foot and ankle surgeon.  The system features low-profile, anatomic plate designs and ORTHOLOC 3Di polyaxial locking screw technology, providing an innovative fracture solution that addresses a primary need for one of the foot and ankle’s largest market segments.
MICA™ Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System – As the first minimally invasive solution specifically designed for foot and ankle surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System provides a minimally disruptive, procedurally integrated solution that features specifically designed implants and instrumentation for percutaneous surgery of the foot.  The MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System can be used to treat multiple pathologies including one of the most common, Hallux Valgus, commonly known as bunions.  Compared to a traditional open surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System has been shown to provide less pain, shorter operative times and improved cosmesis.
Robert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, “We have continued to expand our best-in-class foot and ankle product portfolio to meet the needs of orthopaedic physicians and patients and further extend our leadership position in the fast growing lower extremities and biologics markets.  The launch of our unique INVISION Total Ankle Revision System will expand our leadership in total ankle technology and highlights our ability to address the total ankle replacement continuum of care.  In addition, the ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System and MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System further enhances our offering in the foot and ankle market space and allows for an improved surgical experience.”
Wright is also conducting medical education and training courses during the AOFAS annual meeting in its mobile training lab.  These courses will address total ankle arthroplasty, Charcot reconstruction and limb salvage, and ankle and hindfoot fusion using Augment®.  More information on Wright Medical’s products can be found at www.wright.com.
Internet Posting of Information
Wright routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the “Investor Relations” section of its website at www.wright.com.  The company encourages investors and potential investors to consult the Wright website regularly for important information about Wright.

(NASDAQ:WMGI) today announced that it will highlight new innovations at the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) 2017 Annual Meeting taking place at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, Washington from July 12-15, 2017.
Wright will feature its full range of lower extremities and biologics products at exhibit booth #801 and will showcase, for the first time, three important additions to its foot and ankle portfolio:
INVISION™ Total Ankle Revision System – The first and only system developed specifically for total ankle revision arthroplasty, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System provides a unique solution for even the most difficult revision procedures.  Whether leveraged as a standalone construct or in conjunction with INFINITY and INBONETM components, the INVISION Total Ankle Revision System is an important addition to the continuum of care from total ankle replacement through any necessary revisions.  The INVISION Total Ankle Revision System helps surgeons re-build bone lost through previous surgeries and provides modularity to help restore natural joint height.
ORTHOLOC™ 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System – The ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System features a complete range of ankle fracture plates designed specifically for the foot and ankle surgeon.  The system features low-profile, anatomic plate designs and ORTHOLOC 3Di polyaxial locking screw technology, providing an innovative fracture solution that addresses a primary need for one of the foot and ankle’s largest market segments.
MICA™ Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System – As the first minimally invasive solution specifically designed for foot and ankle surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System provides a minimally disruptive, procedurally integrated solution that features specifically designed implants and instrumentation for percutaneous surgery of the foot.  The MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System can be used to treat multiple pathologies including one of the most common, Hallux Valgus, commonly known as bunions.  Compared to a traditional open surgery, the MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System has been shown to provide less pain, shorter operative times and improved cosmesis.
Robert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, “We have continued to expand our best-in-class foot and ankle product portfolio to meet the needs of orthopaedic physicians and patients and further extend our leadership position in the fast growing lower extremities and biologics markets.  The launch of our unique INVISION Total Ankle Revision System will expand our leadership in total ankle technology and highlights our ability to address the total ankle replacement continuum of care.  In addition, the ORTHOLOC 3Di Ankle Fracture Low Profile System and MICA Minimally-Invasive Foot & Ankle System further enhances our offering in the foot and ankle market space and allows for an improved surgical experience.”
Wright is also conducting medical education and training courses during the AOFAS annual meeting in its mobile training lab.  These courses will address total ankle arthroplasty, Charcot reconstruction and limb salvage, and ankle and hindfoot fusion using Augment®.  More information on Wright Medical’s products can be found at www.wright.com.

WRIGHT’S TRANSFORMATIONAL VALUES















    Positioned To Outperform  Wright Medical Group N.V. is a global medical device company committed to delivering innovative, value-added solutions improving quality of life for patients worldwide and is a recognized leader of surgical solutions for the extremities and biologics markets.         A Global Leader on an Upward Path Wright receives FDA approval for AUGMENT® Bone Graft on September 1, 2015, further enhancing a leadership position and providing a platform technology for future new product development.Wright and Tornier complete merger to create the premier, high-growth extremities-biologics company on October 1, 2015. By bringing together the extensive and innovative capabilities of both companies, we are Your First Choice in Biologics and Extremities.         Focused Excellence  Wright transitions to a high-growth, pure play global Extremities and Biologics company after divesting its OrthoRecon business to MicroPort Scientific Corporation. Wright quickly completes the acquisition of two high-growth extremity companies with complementary products, Solana Surgical and OrthoPro, and launches INFINITY™ Total Ankle Replacement System.         International Expansion Further Accelerates Growth  Wright completes the acquisition of WG Healthcare and Biotech International, adding direct sales channels in the U.K. and France, and complementary extremity products to further accelerate growth opportunities in Wright’s global Extremities business. Wright also completes the acquisition of BioMimetic Therapeutics and launches the ORTHOLOC™ 3Di Ankle Fusion System         Wright’s Transformation Begins  With a clear goal of maximizing the significant opportunity in Foot & Ankle, Wright completes the successful transition of its U.S. Foot & Ankle sales force and becomes the company with the largest, specialized direct sales presence to serve its customers. Additional medical education and physician training, as well as, ongoing innovation through internal product development including the PROPHECY™ INBONE™ Preoperative Navigation Alignment Guides, CLAW™ II Polyaxial Compression Plating System, and the ORTHOLOC™ 3Di Reconstruction Plating System, follow.         Foot & Ankle Market Expansion  Wright acquires the groundbreaking technology of the INBONE™ Total Ankle System. The device offers a unique surgical solution to a long-standing orthopaedic challenge, and is immediately recognized as a significant addition to Wright’s growing Foot & Ankle product portfolio. This period is also marked by increasing medical education programs, expanding product development, and sales force specialization.          A New Focus on Foot & Ankle  In 2005, Wright begins a renewed and unmatched commitment to the specialty of Foot & Ankle. Over the next few years, key acquisitions, such as Darco International, Inc. and continued product development, create a foundation that ultimately will significantly expand Wright’s position within the Foot & Ankle market         A Period of Rapid Expansion  The new millennium ushers in a period of rapid growth for Wright, underscored by its successful initial public offering in July 2001. With an infusion of investment, a vast array of new products and services are introduced, and Wright’s reach into the global market grows significantly over the next 5 years.         Warburg Pincus Aquires Wright  Wright is acquired by Warburg Pincus and a group of investors, and Wright Medical Group, Inc. is formed.         Pioneering the Biologics ­Industry.  Wright assumes a pioneering role in the field of Biologics in 1996 when it introduces its first bone void filler, OSTEOSET™ Medical Grade Calcium Sulfate. The product lays the foundation for an expansive line of biologic solutions introduced over the next decade and beyond.          A Total Knee Trailblaizer Although earlier knee designs from Wright carved the path for success, the unique intramedullary instrumentation and cementless design of the Whiteside Ortholoc Knee was launched in 1983 and initiated a long series of successful knee designs that continue today, offering patients with unique features such medial-pivot kinematics to better replicate the motion of the natural knee.         Dow Acquires Wright Wright is acquired by Dow Corning and becomes Dow Corning Wright.         Wright on the Move Wright’s operations left the Downtown Memphis area and moved to Arlington, Tennessee.         An Icon is Born Orthopaedic innovation continues as Wright introduces a new line of implants for the small joints of the fingers and toes. The Swanson System was the first to use silicone technology for small joint arthroplasty and is still successfully sold and widely used more than 40 years later.         $300 and a Dream Armed with $300 and a dream to design and manufacture a better solution for leg cast walking heels, Wright Manufacturing Company is founded in 1950 by Memphis orthopaedic salesman Frank O. Wright to promote his original “all-rubber walking heel” for leg casts. Although this first product is small and simple, it offers a unique solution to the common problem of back pain caused by the rigid steel heels commonly used at this time.

Wright assumes a pioneering role in the field of Biologics in 1996 when it introduces its first bone void filler, OSTEOSET™ Medical Grade Calcium Sulfate. The product lays the foundation for an expansive line of biologic solutions introduced over the next decade and beyond.          A Total Knee Trailblaizer Although earlier knee designs from Wright carved the path for success, the unique intramedullary instrumentation and cementless design of the Whiteside Ortholoc Knee was launched in 1983 and initiated a long series of successful knee designs that continue today, offering patients with unique features such medial-pivot kinematics to better replicate the motion of the natural knee.         Dow Acquires Wright Wright is acquired by Dow Corning and becomes Dow Corning Wright.         Wright on the Move Wright’s operations left the Downtown Memphis area and moved to Arlington, Tennessee.         An Icon is Born Orthopaedic innovation continues as Wright introduces a new line of implants for the small joints of the fingers and toes. The Swanson System was the first to use silicone technology for small joint arthroplasty and is still successfully sold and widely used more than 40 years later.         $300 and a Dream Armed with $300 and a dream to design and manufacture a better solution for leg cast walking heels, Wright Manufacturing Company is founded in 1950 by Memphis orthopaedic salesman Frank O. Wright to promote his original “all-rubber walking heel” for leg casts. Although this first product is small and simple, it offers a unique solution to the common problem of back pain caused by the rigid steel heels commonly used at this time.
