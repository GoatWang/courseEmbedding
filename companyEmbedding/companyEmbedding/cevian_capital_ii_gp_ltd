Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Item 3.
SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

 
 

 
As of the date hereof, the Reporting Person has purchased for the accounts of the Cevian Funds an aggregate of 118,047,114 Registered Shares for an aggregate consideration (including brokerage commission) of approximately USD 2,669,103,790. The Cevian Funds funded these purchases out of their general working capital. The Registered Shares were purchased using Swiss Francs. For the purposes of this Schedule 13D, a conversion rate of USD 1.00 for each CHF 0.92 was used.

 


Item 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION 

 
 

 
The Reporting Person acquired the Registered Shares to which this Schedule 13D relates for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business because they believed the Registered Shares represented an attractive investment opportunity.

 
 

 
In pursuing such investment purposes, the Reporting Person may further purchase, hold, vote, trade, dispose, engage in hedging and in similar transactions with respect to the Registered Shares or otherwise deal in the Registered Shares or any derivative securities at times, and in such manner, as they deem advisable to benefit from changes in market prices of such Registered Shares, changes in the Issuer's operations, business strategy or prospects, or from sale or merger of the Issuer.  To evaluate such alternatives, the Reporting Person will routinely monitor the Issuer's operations, prospects, business development, management, competitive and strategic matters, capital structure, and prevailing market conditions, as well as alternative investment opportunities, liquidity requirements of the Reporting Person and other investment considerations.  Consistent with its investment research methods and evaluation criteria, the Reporting Person may discuss such matters with management or directors of the Issuer, other shareholders, industry analysts, existing or potential strategic partners or competitors, investment and financing professionals, sources of credit and other investors.  Such factors and discussions may materially affect, and result in, the Reporting Person's modifying the Cevian Funds' ownership of Registered Shares, exchanging information with the Issuer and any of the foregoing persons pursuant to appropriate confidentiality or similar agreements, proposing changes in the Issuer's operations, governance, capitalization, use of capital, financial metrics, capital allocations, corporate structure, including acquisitions or dispositions, proposing or nominating director candidates to the Issuer’s board of directors, changing their intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in Item 4 of Schedule 13D and/or in proposing one or more of the other actions described in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D as the Reporting Person may deem appropriate.

 
 

 
Except as set forth herein, the Reporting Person has no present plan or proposal that would relate to or result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a)-(j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
