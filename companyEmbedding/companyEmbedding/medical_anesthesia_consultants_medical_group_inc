Anesthesia & Pain Management Charges
MAC charges you directly, rather than the hospital, surgery center, or outpatient facility, on a fee-for-service basis. (As a courtesy, we will also send your bill to your insurance company.) The bill is based on several factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the time involved, and your health status. The medical facility where your surgery was performed will send you a separate bill for anesthetic medicines, gases, and use of monitoring and disposable equipment.
Billing Procedures
MAC will bill your insurance company for professional services associated with anesthesia and/or pain management care. We contract with many HMO and PPO insurance plans, receiving payment directly from them.
Look for an explanation of benefits from your insurance company within 60 days of your surgery. If you haven’t received a response, you may want to contact your insurance carrier directly to determine claim status. The company may be waiting for additional information either from another healthcare provider or from you.
If we do not participate with your particular insurance carrier, you will receive a monthly statement from us showing the status of your account and the amount due.
Payment Policy
After your insurance company, including your secondary insurance company (if applicable), has paid the claim, there is often a balance due for deductible or co-insurance amounts. This balance is due upon your receipt of our statement.
We understand that expenses associated with surgery can be significant. We will do everything we can to accommodate your financial needs. If you do not have insurance or cannot afford to pay the balance in full within 30 days, please contact the billing department to set up a monthly payment plan.
We accept payment by cash, check, money order, American Express©, Visa©, or MasterCard©. Please mail your payment to MAC with the top portion of your statement.

Optimizing Patient Flow with Cost-effective, Customized Anesthesia Solutions
MAC, an Anesthesia Business Group (ABG) member, is the most progressive group in Northern California, with both clinical expertise and administrative depth and leadership. We make solid commitments with hospitals and surgery centers to work efficiently at providing superior medical competence as well as exceptional management and management-related services. At MAC, we focus our relationships on forming more of a partnership than a traditional business liaison.
We employ an in-house professional management staff, many of whom hold MBA degrees and are licensed CPAs. Each client site/hospital has a MAC Site Director responsible for all site-specific matters, including clinical and human resource issues. We believe this pre-emptive approach is very unique and demonstrates our commitment and understanding of the management systems required by hospital partners.
Contact us to learn how MAC can streamline your organization’s perioperative care.

Anesthesiology

				An anesthesiologist is trained to provide pain relief and maintenance, or restoration, of a stable condition during and immediately following an operation or an obstetric or diagnostic procedure. The anesthesiologist assesses the risk of the patient undergoing surgery and optimizes the patient's condition prior to, during and after surgery. In addition to these management responsibilities, the anesthesiologist provides medical management and consultation in pain management and critical care medicine. Anesthesiologists diagnose and treat acute, long-standing and cancer pain problems; diagnose and treat patients with critical illnesses or severe injuries; direct resuscitation in the care of patients with cardiac or respiratory emergencies, including the need for artificial ventilation; and supervise post-anesthesia recovery.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
                            



                                Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)

Managing Bottlenecks to Increase Perioperative Efficiency









































Supply Chain Management




























Improve Supply System Management and Controls
Establishing and maintaining an efficient supply chain is a multi-dimensional investment for hospitals. While supply acquisition costs alone account for a significant portion of your facility's spend, the remaining portion of your materials budget is largely comprised of product receiving, maintenance, and disposal costs, requiring more than a little time and money to facilitate.
With the proven experience of Soyring Consulting, your facility can avoid critical oversights in the areas of inventory management and control, purchase ordering, and many other aspects of supply chain management that can significantly affect the financial well-being and accountability of your healthcare practice.
Our streamlined solutions are always highly customized to meet your unique needs while sparing ample time and money.
Focus Areas & Offerings:
















        Charge Capture
    


            Inaccurate product entries in your Materials Management system can have drastic implications on the transparency of your purchasing process. Systems (both automated and manual) often contain products that are no longer being used, interface with rarely updated systems (preference cards), contain product duplicates and are missing new products; ultimately compromising your data integrity. Inaccurate data can lead to futile negotiation efforts with vendors and frustrating conversations with physicians and department leadership. Soyring can evaluate your Materials Management systems and processes to ensure that you are accurately capturing the materials used and the system is being updated appropriately, while optimizing the associated labor and automation costs.
        










        Equipment and Property Management
    


When establishing a process that ensures that equipment is effectively managed, we can assist by evaluating property and equipment by department. We will then assist in:

Determining the lifetime use and depreciation date
Review the monitoring, preventative maintenance, and repair process for equipment
Analyze the processes for removing old equipment/property and purchasing new equipment/property












        Inventory Control
    


            Our team will review par levels and inventory on hand to provide objective information on where your facility stands. Our experience allows us to pinpoint areas in need of process improvement to ensure that par levels are appropriate and the dollar amounts of inventory are not excessive.
        










        Materials Cost Reduction
    


We assist in analyzing your data against benchmarks, renegotiating contracts, using our clinicians to help change behavior and monitor savings. Our expertise lies in creating change within difficult to administer physician preference categories using the assistance of our clinical consultants.
Find out more about materials standardization and cost-saving strategies »











        Purchase Ordering
    


            We will review your product valuation process, contract compliance, and consignment process to ensure your facility is benefiting from uniform vendor standards and limiting exposure to risk.
        










        Receiving and Distribution
    


            Inventory locations, stocking, and distribution processes are often some of the biggest "dissatisfiers" among departments served by Materials Management. Our team will evaluate your materials flow and distribution process to identify deficiencies, successes, and interfacing department issues to recommend distribution changes and create satisfied customers.
        










        Staffing and Scheduling
    


            Determining how to best utilize staff within your department can be difficult with limited resources, demanding departments, fluctuating volumes, and shifting priorities. Our team will analyze your current staffing structure, downtime utilization, review departmental needs, and consider any major facility changes to recommend optimal staffing based on your resources. We can then provide you with the ideal work flows, work assignments, and scheduling.
        










        Storage and Handling
    


            Optimizing your space utilization is often a daunting task with variable clinical needs and constraints on materials storage and locations. Our materials consultants determine optimal location for supplies, whether in a new or existing space. We specialize in working with difficult to handle areas such as case cart systems, specialty item storage (specialty packs/instruments/implants) and standardization on units.
        
















Regardless of the state of your current supply chain, Soyring Consulting employs professionals with the versatility and training to meet every client's needs. For the better part of a decade, we have been honing our practices to provide actionable solutions to meet the unique needs of your facility.

        Ambulatory Strategy
    


Patient care is increasingly moving to outpatient environments as reduction in reimbursement and medical necessity documentation increases on the inpatient side.

Soyring will assist in developing and implementing ambulatory and outpatient strategies through the following:

Evaluation of current outpatient activities

Reach within the community

With freestanding EDs becoming a more common model of emergency care, it is important that they have the capability of performing at the same level, if not better, than hospital EDs due to their accessibility and implication of providing faster, more efficient care to its patients in the community. Soyring Emergency Department Consultants can assess all aspects of a hospital emergency department setting at a freestanding ED, including:

Availability/On-site Diagnostic Services (e.g., lab and imaging)
Staff Roles and Responsibilities
Staff Skill Mix
Process and Procedures
Patient and Staff Satisfaction
Productivity
Strategic Planning
Financial Planning

Soyring Consulting strives to promote the best clinical, operational, billing, patient satisfaction, and employee satisfaction engagement. Our team is uniquely capable of evaluating every aspect of clinic practices, ranging from single-provider offices to multiple-site, hospital-based clinics. We offer comprehensive operations reviews, implementation engagements, and interim management services. Soyring’s team of consultants has extensive experience working in acute care environments, outpatient settings, and with medical clinics to ensure efficient, quality care is provided. A few areas we are capable of assessing include the following:

Operational Considerations

Organizational Structure: Ensure efficient reporting structures exist to accomplish day-to-day operations
Business Operations: Appropriate billing and accounting operations
Staffing: Appropriate staffing levels to meet volume needs

“The staff that Soyring brings to the facility was essentially members of our hospital family. We treated them like management staff here at the hospital.
