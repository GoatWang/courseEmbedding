† The Expenses for the Fund as disclosed in the prospectus dated February 28, 2017.
Performance data quoted represents past performance which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.	      
	    Mutual fund performance changes over time and current performance may be lower or higher than what is stated. To receive performance current to the most recent month-end, please call 1-800-864-1013. 
	    See the prospectus for other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the funds.

	    Waivers/reimbursements are voluntary, and can be terminated at any time.

	    Total return represents the value of an investment after reinvesting all income and capital gains.      

	    Small company stocks are less liquid and subject to greater price volatility than large capitalization stocks.
	    A portion of the income generated by the municipal and tax-free funds are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and state and local taxes. 
Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices.
The Wesmark Balanced Fund, Wesmark West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund, and Wesmark Small Company Growth Fund are each the successor to a common trust fund managed by the Adviser. The quoted performance data includes performance for the corresponding common trust fund during periods before the funds' registration statements became effective (on August 1, 2000 for the Small Company Growth Fund; on March 12, 1997 for the West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund; and on March 24, 1998 for the Balanced Fund), as adjusted to reflect the funds' anticipated expenses. The common trust funds were not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") and therefore were not subject to certain restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act. If the common trust funds had been registered under the 1940 Act, the performance may have been adversely affected.

	    *The 30-Day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by the maximum offering price per share on that date. The figure is compounded and annualized.

	    These performance numbers are pre-tax. Regulations do not require us to provide after tax returns. For after tax returns, call 1-800-864-1013.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund pursues its investment objective primarily by selecting equity securities of growth oriented companies. Equity securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, securities (including debt securities) that are convertible into common stocks, and exchange traded funds (ETF) and other investment companies. The fund will invest primarily in securities issued by domestic companies. It may purchase ETFs or other investment companies in order to achieve exposure to a specific market sector, to achieve exposure to foreign markets or for other reasons consistent with its investment strategy.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 599 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80% of the value of its net assets in equity securities of small capitalization companies. In creating a diversified portfolio of investments in small-sized companies, WesBanco Investment Department, a division of WesBanco Bank, Inc. (the Adviser), defines small companies as companies that do not exceed the market capitalizations in the Russell 2000® Index (Russell 2000), or the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600® Index (S&P 600) at the time of purchasing a security.


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The Russell 2000  Index is an unmanaged market capitalization-weighted index of 2,000 small company stocks of U.S. domiciled companies.
Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of 600 small-capitalization stocks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

</R>

While there is no assurance that a Fund will achieve its investment
objective, it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies
described in this prospectus.
What are the Funds Main Investment Strategies?
<R>

The Funds investment adviser is WesBanco Investment Department
(Adviser).

</R>

WesMark Small Company Growth Fund

<R>

The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80%
of the value of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for
investment purposes in investments in small capitalization companies.
In creating a diversified portfolio of common stocks of small-sized
companies the Adviser will define small companies as companies with
market capitalizations similar to companies in the Russell 2000 Index
(Russell 2000), or the Standard & Poors Small Cap 600 Index
(S&P 600). The Adviser will select stocks of companies with growth
characteristics, such as above-average earnings growth potential or
where significant changes are taking place, such as new products, services,
or methods of distributions, or overall business restructuring.

</R>

WesMark Growth Fund
The Fund pursues its investment objective by selecting growth-oriented
stocks of companies that are expected to achieve higher than average
profitability ratios such as operating profit margin or return on equity.
Equity securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, and securities
(including debt securities) that are convertible into common stocks.
WesMark Balanced Fund
The Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in a mix
of equity, fixed income and money market investments. The Funds
portfolio is constructed by the Adviser using an asset allocation process.
The Adviser first determines the percentage of the Funds portfolio
to invest in equity securities, the percentage to invest in fixed income
securities and the percentage to invest in money market investments.
The Adviser will then select securities for each asset class.
WesMark Bond Fund
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80%
of the Funds assets in fixed income securities. The Fund invests
primarily in investment grade fixed income securities, including repurchase
agreements collateralized by such investment grade securities.
WesMark West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80%
of its net assets in a professionally managed portfolio consisting primarily
of investment grade securities issued by the State of West Virginia
and its political subdivisions, agencies, and authorities, and other
issuers (such as possessions or territories of the U.S.), the interest
of which is exempt from federal and West Virginia income tax.
What are the main risks of investing in the FUnd?
In addition to the risks set forth below that are specific to an
investment in a particular Fund, there are risks common to all mutual
funds.
For example, a funds share price may decline and an investor
could lose money. Also, there is no assurance that a Fund will achieve
its investment objective. The Shares offered by this prospectus are
not deposits or obligations of any bank, including WesBanco Bank, (WesBanco),
are not endorsed or guaranteed by the U.S. government, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other government
agency.

</R>

1 The value of equity securities rises and falls.
2 The possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to
  pay interest or principal when due.
3 Prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest
  rate changes.
4 Value stocks depend less on price changes for returns and may lag behind
  growth stocks in an up market.
5 Growth stocks depend more on price changes for returns and may be more
  adversely affected in a down market compared to value stocks.
6 The smaller the capitalization of a company, the less liquid its stock
  and the more volatile its price.

<R>

7 CMOs with complex or highly variable prepayment terms generally
entail greater market, prepayment and liquidity risks.

</R>
<R>

8 An issuer may redeem a fixed income security before maturity at a price
  below its current market price.

</R>
<R>

9 The relative volatility of mortgage-backed securities is due to the likelihood
  of prepayments which increase in a declining interest rate environment and decrease
  in a rising interest rate environment.

</R>
<R>

10 Certain market sectors may underperform other sectors or the market as
  a whole.

</R>
<R>

11 Changes in federal tax laws may cause the prices of tax exempt securities
  to fall.

</R>
<R>

12 Compared to diversified mutual funds, a non-diversified fund may invest
  a higher percentage of its assets among fewer issuers of portfolio securities.
  This increases the Funds risk by magnifying the impact (positively or
  negatively) that any one issuer has on the Funds share price and performance.

</R>
<R>

13 ETFs may be subject to the following risks that do not apply to conventional
  mutual funds: (i) the market price of an ETFs shares may trade above or
  below their net asset value; (ii) an active trading market for an ETFs
  shares may not develop or be maintained; or (iii) trading of an ETFs shares
  may be halted if the listing exchanges officials deem such action appropriate.

</R>
<R>

14 The portfolio may comprise securities issued or credit enhanced by issuers
  located in West Virginia. Therefore, the Fund will be more susceptible to any
  economic, business, political or other developments which generally affect these
  issuers.

</R>

WESMARK SMALL COMPANY GROWTH FUND
Risk/Return Bar Chart and Table

<R>

The Fund is the successor to the portfolio of a common trust fund
(CTF) (the Predecessor Fund). The Predecessor Fund was managed
by WesBanco Investment Department, the Funds Investment Adviser.
Prior to the Funds commencement of operations date of August 8,
2000, the Fund had no investment operations. Accordingly, the performance
information and financial information provided in this prospectus for
the periods prior to that date is historical information of the Predecessor
Fund adjusted to reflect the Funds anticipated expenses. The CTF
was not registered under the Investment Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and therefore
was not subject to certain investment restrictions imposed by the 1940
Act. If the CTF had been registered under the 1940 Act, the performance
may have been adversely affected.

</R>
<R>

The performance information shown below will help you analyze the
Funds investment risks in light of its historical returns. The
bar chart shows the variability of the Funds total returns on
a calendar year-by-year basis. The Average Annual Total Return table
shows returns averaged over the stated periods, and includes comparative
performance information. The Funds performance will fluctuate,
and past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee of future
results.

</R>
<R>
 

</R>
<R>

The total returns shown in the bar chart do not reflect the payment of any
  sales charges or recurring shareholder account fees. If these charges or fees
  had been included, the returns shown would have been lower.

</R>
<R>

Within the periods shown in the bar chart, the Funds highest quarterly
  return was 46.14% (quarter ended December 31, 1999). Its lowest quarterly
  return was (29.97)% (quarter ended September 30, 2001).

</R>


Average Annual Total Return Table

<R>

The Average Annual Total Returns for the Funds Shares are reduced to
  reflect applicable sales charges. Return Before Taxes is shown. In addition,
  Return After Taxes is shown to illustrate the effect of federal taxes on Fund
  returns. Actual after-tax returns depend on each investors personal
  tax situation, and are likely to differ from those shown. The table shows
  returns for the Russell 2000 Index (Russell 2000), an unmanaged index of small
  company stocks and the Standard and Poors 600 Small Cap Index (S&P
  600), an unmanaged capitalization-weighted index representing all major industries
  in the small-cap sector of the U.S. stock market. Both the Russell 2000
  and the S&P 600 are broad-based market indexes. The table also shows returns
  for the Lipper Small Cap Growth Funds Average (LSCGFA), an average of funds
  with similar objectives. Index returns do not reflect taxes, sales charges,
  expenses or other fees that the SEC requires to be reflected in the Funds
  performance. Indexes are unmanaged, and unlike the Fund are not affected by
  cash flows. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Lipper figures
  represent the average of the total returns reported by all mutual funds designated
  by Lipper, Inc. as falling into the respective categories indicated.

1 The Funds start of performance date was August 8, 2000.

</R>
<R>

2 The Fund is the successor to the portfolio of a common trust fund
  (CTF) managed by the Adviser. At the Funds commencement of operations,
  the CTFs assets were transferred to the Fund in exchange for Fund shares.
  The CTF was not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940
  Act) and was therefore not subject to the restrictions under the 1940
  Act. If the CTF had been registered under the 1940 Act, return before taxes,
  return after taxes on distributions and return after taxes on distributions
  and sales of Fund shares would have been disclosed above.

</R>
<R>

3 After-tax returns are calculated using a standard set of assumptions.
  The stated returns assume the highest historical federal income and capital
  gains tax rates. Return After Taxes on Distributions assumes a continued investment
  in the Fund and shows the effect of taxes on Fund distributions. Return After
  Taxes on Distributions and Sales of Fund Shares assumes all shares were redeemed
  at the end of each measurement period, and shows the effect of any taxable gain
  (or offsetting loss) on redemption, as well as the effects of taxes on Fund
  distributions. These after-tax returns do not reflect the effect of any
  applicable state and local taxes. After-tax returns are not relevant
  to investors holding shares through tax-deferred programs, such as IRA or 401(K)
  plans.

WESMARK BALANCED FUND
Risk/Return Bar Chart and Table

<R>

The Fund is the successor to the portfolio of a common trust fund
(CTF) (the Predecessor Fund). The Predecessor Fund was managed
by WesBanco Investment Department, the Funds Investment Adviser.
Prior to the Funds commencement of operations date of April 20,
1998, the Fund had no investment operations. Accordingly, the performance
information and financial information provided in this prospectus for
the periods prior to that date is historical information of the Predecessor
Fund adjusted to reflect the Funds anticipated expenses. The CTF
was not registered under the Investment Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and therefore
was not subject to certain investment restrictions imposed by the 1940
Act. If the CTF had been registered under the 1940 Act, the performance
may have been adversely affected.

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing
in each of the WesMark Funds (the Funds) with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.

</R>
<R>

The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in each of the Funds
for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at
the end of those periods. The example also assumes that your investment
has a 5% return each year and that each Funds operating expenses
are before waivers as estimated in the table and remain the same. Although
your actual costs and returns may be higher or lower, based on these
assumptions your costs would be:

What are the Funds Investment Strategies?
WESMARK SMALL COMPANY GROWTH FUND

<R>

The Adviser selects stocks of companies which meet certain fundamental
and technical standards of selection, and have an above-average potential
for appreciation. The Fund will typically invest in companies in market
sectors that offer the highest growth potential, which historically
have been telecommunication, computer hardware and software, technology,
healthcare, and biotechnology. However, the Fund may invest in other
sectors if, in the Advisers opinion, they offer a better opportunity
for growth. The Adviser will select stocks of companies with growth
characteristics, such as above-average earnings growth potential or
where significant changes are taking place, such as new products, services,
or methods of distributions, or overall business restructuring. The
Funds investment philosophy will be to select rapidly growing
companies with the expectation that this rapid growth will overcome
any deficiencies in either balance sheet strength or high valuation.
Opportunities that are identified in more mature industries may also
be selected for investment by the Fund.

</R>
<R>

The Fund may purchase shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The
shares of ETFs are listed and traded on stock exchanges at market prices.


</R>
<R>

The Fund may invest in ETFs in order to achieve exposure to a specific
market sector, or for other reasons consistent with its investment strategy.

</R>
<R>

The Adviser anticipates investing its cash balances in investments
such as money market funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper
and short-term U.S. government agency and Treasury securities. 

</R>
<R>

The Fund under normal circumstances, will invest at least 80% of
its net assets in investments in small companies. In creating a diversified
portfolio of common stocks of small-sized companies the Adviser will
define small companies as companies with market capitalizations similar
to companies in the Russell 2000 or the S&P 600 which are unmanaged,
broad-based capitalization-weighted indexes representing all major industries
in the small-cap sector of the U.S. stock market. As of May 28, 2004,
the Russell 2000s market capitalization range was 175.8 million
to 1.6 billion and as of September 30, 2004, the S&P 600s
range was 40 million to 3.52 billion. The capitalization ranges of the
indexes frequently change as the market value of the stocks that comprise
the indexes change or as stocks are added or removed from the indices.

</R>
<R>

If a company is within the capitalization range of an index at the
time of investment, but subsequently falls outside the index range,
the Fund will not be required to sell such companys security.

</R>
<R>

Because the Fund refers to small company investments in its name,
it will notify shareholders at least 60 days in advance of any change
in its investment policies that would permit the Fund to normally invest
less than 80% of its assets in investments in small companies.

</R>

Wesmark Growth Fund
The Fund strives to meet its investment goal by selecting growth-oriented
stocks of companies that are expected to achieve higher than average
profitability ratios such as operating profit margin or return
on equity. These stocks are purchased by the Fund only when their
price-earnings ratio in relation to market averages such as
the Standard & Poors 500 Index (S&P 500) is
within historical ranges.

<R>

Although a companys earnings may be continually growing, the
Fund may sell such a company if, in the judgment of the Adviser, its
stock price is excessively overvalued.

</R>

Most often, these companies will be considered as large-
or mid- capitalization companies. The Funds investment
approach is based on the conviction that, over the long term, the economy
will continue to expand and develop and that this economic growth will
be reflected in the growth of the revenues and earnings of publicly
held corporations. Equity securities include common stocks, preferred
stocks, and securities (including debt securities) that are convertible
into common stocks.

<R>

The Fund may purchase shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The
shares of ETFs are listed and traded on stock exchanges at market prices.
The Fund may invest in ETFs in order to achieve exposure to a specific
market sector, or for other reasons consistent with its investment strategy.

</R>
<R>

The Adviser anticipates investing its cash balances in investments
such as money market funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper
and short-term U.S. government agency and Treasury securities.

</R>

WESMARK BALANCED FUND

<R>

The Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in a mix
of equity, fixed income and money market investments. The Funds
portfolio is constructed by the Adviser using an asset allocation process.
The Adviser first determines the percentage of the Funds portfolio
to invest in equity securities, the percentage to invest in fixed income
securities and the percentage to invest in money market investments
based on its view of economic and market conditions. In making this
determination, the Fund will stay within a percentage range for equity
securities, fixed income securities and money market instruments. The
following table shows the percentage ranges for the Fund:

</R>

Equity


    

Fixed Income


    

Money Market




30-70%

 

30-70%

 

0-40%




Within the equity allocation, the Adviser anticipates investing primarily
in the common stock of domestic companies with large and medium market
capitalizations and may use a blend of styles in selecting stocks, i.e.
stocks may be selected for either their growth characteristics or value
characteristics, or both. Equity securities include common stocks, preferred
stocks, and securities (including debt securities) that are convertible
into common stocks.
Within the fixed income allocation the Adviser anticipates investing
primarily in U.S. dollar dominated investment-grade fixed income securities.
Investment grade securities are securities rated in one of the top four
ratings categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
(NRSRO) or securities that are unrated but are determined by the Adviser
to be of comparable quality. (See Investment Ratings for Investment
Grade Securities). Such investment grade securities include U.S.
government agency and treasury securities, investment grade corporate
debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and asset backed securities.

<R>

Within the money market allocation the Adviser anticipates investing
primarily in a portfolio of short-term, high-quality fixed income securities
issued by banks, corporations and the U.S. government. The Adviser,
seeks to limit the credit risk taken by the Fund by monitoring
the credit condition of portfolio securities on an ongoing basis by
reviewing periodic financial data and ratings of NRSROs. Specific investments
include investments in money market funds, repurchase agreements, commercial
paper and short-term U.S. government agency and Treasury securities.

</R>
<R>

The Fund may purchase shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The
shares of ETFs are listed and traded on stock exchanges at market prices.
The Fund may invest in ETFs in order to achieve exposure to a specific
market sector, or for other reasons consistent with its investment strategy.

</R>
<R>

By combining equity securities, fixed income securities and money
market instruments, the Fund seeks to dampen market volatility, while
striving to achieve its investment objective.

</R>

WESMARK BOND FUND
The Fund invests primarily in a professionally managed, diversified
portfolio of bonds, which includes all permitted types of debt instruments.
Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Funds assets will
be invested in fixed income investments.

<R>

The Fund invests primarily in investment grade securities, including
repurchase agreements collateralized by such investment grade securities.
Investment grade securities are securities rated in one of the top four
ratings categories by a NRSRO or securities that are unrated but are
determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. (See Investment
Ratings for Investment Grade Securities). Downgraded securities
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the Adviser. The Adviser
will determine whether or not the security continues to be an acceptable
investment.The Fund will invest in those sectors of the bond market
that offer the highest yield in relation to historical yield spreads.
By recognizing changing relative yields and allocating the assets of
the Fund into the most attractive market and maturity sectors, the Fund
will attempt to achieve above average returns. The Fund may invest in
fixed income securities of any maturity (i.e., short, intermediate,
or long term).

</R>
<R>

The Adviser anticipates investing its cash balances in investments
such as money market funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper
and short-term U.S. government agency and Treasury securities. Because
the Fund refers to fixed income securities in its name, it will notify
shareholders at least 60 days in advance of any change in its investment
policies that would enable the Fund to normally invest less than 80%
of its assets in fixed income securities.

</R>

WESMARK WEST VIRGINIA MUNICIPAL BOND FUND
The Fund attempts to achieve its investment objective by investing
in a professionally managed portfolio consisting primarily of investment
grade securities issued by the State of West Virginia and its political
subdivisions, agencies, and authorities, and other issuers (such as
possessions or territories of the U.S.), the interest of which is exempt
from federal and West Virginia income tax (West Virginia Municipal
Securities). As a matter of fundamental investment policy which
may not be changed without shareholder approval, the Fund will invest
its assets so that, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its
net assets are invested in obligations, the interest income from which
is exempt from federal income tax and the income taxes imposed by the
state of West Virginia. For purposes of this policy, the tax-free interest
must not be a preference item for purposes of computing the federal
alternative minimum tax (AMT).

<R>

The Adviser may attempt to minimize market volatility by selecting
intermediate term securities (securities with an average maturity generally
between five and seven years). The Fund will buy and sell securities
to take advantage of opportunities to enhance yield. These transactions
may generate capital gains (losses) which have different tax treatment
than tax-exempt interest income. The Fund may invest a portion of its
assets in non-West Virginia municipal bonds if, in the judgement
of the Adviser, the supply and yield of such securities would be beneficial
to the Funds performance.

</R>
<R>

TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE INVESTMENTS

</R>
<R>

The Funds may temporarily depart from their principal investment
strategies by investing their assets in cash, cash items, and shorter-term,
higher-quality debt securities and similar obligations. They may do
this to minimize potential losses and maintain liquidity to meet shareholder
redemptions during adverse market conditions. This may cause a Fund
to give up greater investment returns to maintain the safety of principal,
that is, the original amount invested by shareholders.

</R>


What are the Principal Securities in Which the Funds Invest?
In pursuing their investment strategy, the Funds may invest in the
following securities for any purpose that is consistent with their investment
objective. The following table indicates the principal securities in

</R>

EQUITY SECURITIES
Equity securities represent a share of an issuers earnings
and assets, after the issuer pays its liabilities. A Fund cannot
predict the income it will receive from equity securities because issuers
generally have discretion as to the payment of any dividends or distributions.
However, equity securities offer greater potential for appreciation
than many other types of securities, because their value increases directly
with the value of the issuers business. The following describes
the types of equity securities in which a Fund may invest.
Common Stocks
Common stocks are the most prevalent type of equity security. Common
stocks receive the issuers earnings after the issuer pays its
creditors and any preferred stockholders. As a result, changes in an
issuers earnings directly influence the value of its common stock.
Preferred Stocks
Preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or
distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common stock.
Some preferred stocks also participate in dividends and distributions
paid on common stock. Preferred stocks may also permit the issuer to
redeem the stock. A Fund may also treat such redeemable preferred stock
as a fixed income security.
FIXED INCOME SECURITIES
Fixed income securities pay interest, dividends or distributions
at a specified rate. The rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal
or adjusted periodically. In addition, the issuer of a fixed income
security must repay the principal amount of the security, normally within
a specified time. Fixed income securities provide more regular income
than equity securities. However, the returns on fixed income securities
are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings.
This limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as
compared to equity securities.
A securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security
as a percentage of its price. A securitys yield will increase
or decrease depending upon whether it costs less (a discount) or more
(a premium) than the principal amount. If the issuer may redeem the
security before its scheduled maturity, the price and yield on a discount
or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early
redemption. Securities with higher risks generally have higher yields.
The following describes the types of fixed income securities in which
the Funds may invest.
Treasury Securities
Treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal government
of the United States. Treasury securities are generally regarded as
having the lowest credit risks.
Agency Securities
Agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or
other government sponsored entity (GSE) acting under federal authority.
Some GSE securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the
United States. These include the Government National Mortgage Association,
Small Business Administration, Farm Credit System Financial Assistance
Corporation, Farmers Home Administration, Federal Financing Bank,
General Services Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Washington
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Bonds. Other GSE securities receive
support through federal subsidies, loans or other benefits. For example,
the U.S. Treasury is authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities
issued by (or otherwise make funds available to) the Federal Home Loan
Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National
Mortgage Association, Student Loan Marketing Association, and Tennessee
Valley Authority in support of such obligations.
A few GSE securities have no explicit financial support, but are
regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors
their activities. These include the Farm Credit System, the Financing
Corporation, and Resolution Funding Corporation.
Investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks, but
not as low as Treasury securities.
A Fund creates mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by a GSE as
if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency. Although such a guarantee
protects against credit risks, it does not reduce market and prepayment
risks.
Corporate Debt Securities
Corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by businesses.
Notes, bonds, debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent
types of corporate debt securities. A Fund may also purchase interests
in bank loans to companies. The credit risks of corporate debt securities
vary widely among issuers.
In addition, the credit risk of an issuers debt security may
vary based on its priority for repayment. For example, higher ranking
(senior) debt securities have a higher priority than lower ranking (subordinated)
securities. This means that the issuer might not make payments on subordinated
securities while continuing to make payments on senior securities. In
addition, in the event of bankruptcy, holders of senior securities may
receive amounts otherwise payable to the holders of subordinated securities.
Some subordinated securities, such as trust preferred and capital securities
notes, also permit the issuer to defer payments under certain circumstances.
For example, insurance companies issue securities known as surplus notes
that permit the insurance company to defer any payment that would reduce
its capital below regulatory requirements.
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
Mortgage-backed securities represent interests in pools of mortgages.
The mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates,
maturities and other terms. Mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest
rates. Interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as
ARMs.
Mortgage-backed securities come in a variety of forms. Many have
extremely complicated terms. The simplest form of mortgage-backed securities
are pass-through certificates. An issuer of pass-through certificates
gathers monthly payments from an underlying pool of mortgages. Then,
the issuer deducts its fees and expenses and passes the balance of the
payments on to the certificate holders once a month. Holders of pass-through
certificates receive a pro rata share of all payments and pre-payments
from the underlying mortgages. As a result, the holders assume all the
prepayment risks of the underlying mortgages.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)
CMOs, including interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits
(REMICs), allocate payments and prepayments from an underlying pass-through
certificate among holders of different classes of mortgage-backed securities.
This creates different prepayment and market risks for each CMO class.
IOS AND POS

CMOs may allocate interest payments to one class (Interest Only
or IOs) and principal payments to another class (Principal Only or POs).
POs increase in value when prepayment rates increase. In contrast, IOs
decrease in value when prepayments increase, because the underlying
mortgages generate less interest payments. However, IOs tend to increase
in value when interest rates rise (and prepayments decrease), making
IOs a useful hedge against interest rate risks.


Asset Backed Securities
Asset backed securities are payable from pools of obligations other
than mortgages. Most asset backed securities involve consumer or commercial
debts with maturities of less than ten years. However, almost any type
of fixed income assets (including other fixed income securities) may
be used to create an asset backed security. Asset backed securities
may take the form of commercial paper, notes, or pass through certificates.
Asset backed securities have prepayment risks. Like CMOs, asset backed
securities may be structured like floating rate securities, IOs and
POs.
Credit enhancement
Credit enhancement consists of an arrangement in which a company
agrees to pay amounts due on a fixed income security if the issuer defaults.
In some cases the company providing credit enhancement makes all payments
directly to the security holders and receives reimbursement from the
issuer. Normally, the credit enhancer has greater financial resources
and liquidity than the issuer. For this reason, the Sub-Adviser usually
evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security based solely upon
its credit enhancement.
TAX EXEMPT SECURITIES
Tax exempt securities are fixed income securities that pay interest
that is not subject to regular federal and/or state income taxes. Typically,
states, counties, cities and other political subdivisions and authorities
issue tax exempt securities. The market categorizes tax exempt securities
by their source of repayment.
General Obligation Bonds
General obligation bonds are supported by the issuers power
to impose property or other taxes. The issuer must impose and collect
taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. However,
the issuers authority to impose additional taxes may be limited
by its charter or state law.
Special Revenue Bonds
Special revenue bonds are payable solely from specific revenues received
by the issuer such as specific taxes, assessments, tolls, or fees. Special
revenue bondholders may not collect from the municipalitys general
taxes or revenues. For example, a municipality may issue bonds to build
a toll road, and pledge the tolls to repay the bonds. Therefore, a shortfall
in the tolls could result in a default on the bonds.

<R>

SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS

</R>
<R>

Repurchase Agreements

</R>
<R>

Repurchase agreements are transactions in which a Fund buys
a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back
at a mutually agreed upon time and price. The repurchase price exceeds
the sale price, reflecting a Funds return on the transaction.
This return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security.
A Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other
recognized financial institutions, such as securities dealers, deemed
creditworthy by the Adviser.

</R>
<R>

The Funds custodian or subcustodian will take possession of
the securities subject to repurchase agreements. The Adviser or subcustodian
will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure
that the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase
price.

</R>

Investing in Securities of Other Investment Companies

<R>

The Funds may invest its assets in securities of other investment
companies, including the securities of money market funds affiliated
with Federated Investors, Inc. (Federated), as an efficient means of
carrying out its investment policies and managing its uninvested cash.
These other investment companies are managed independently of the Funds
and incur additional expenses. Therefore, any such investment by a Fund
may be subject to duplicate expenses. However, the Adviser believes
that the benefits and efficiencies of this approach should outweigh
the additional expenses.

</R>
<R>

The Small Company Growth Fund, the Growth Fund and the Balanced Fund
may also invest in ETFs. As with traditional mutual funds, ETFs charge
asset-based fees, although these fees tend to be relatively low.
ETFs do not charge initial sales charges or redemption fees and
investors pay only customary brokerage fees to buy and sell ETF shares.

</R>

INVESTMENT RATINGS FOR INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES
The Adviser will determine whether a security is investment grade
based upon the credit ratings given by one or more NRSRO. For example,
Standard and Poors, a rating service, assigns ratings to investment
grade securities (AAA, AA, A, and BBB) based on their assessment of
the issuers ability to pay interest or principal (default)
when due on each security. Lower credit ratings correspond to higher
credit risk. If a security has not received a rating, a Fund must rely
entirely upon the Advisers credit assessment that the security
is comparable to investment grade.

</R>

STOCK MARKET RISKS

The value of equity securities in a Funds portfolio will rise
and fall. These fluctuations could be a sustained trend or a drastic
movement. A Funds portfolio will reflect changes in prices of
individual portfolio stocks or general changes in stock valuations.
Consequently, a Funds share price may decline.

The Adviser attempts to manage market risk by limiting the amount
a Fund invests in each companys equity securities. However, diversification
will not protect a Fund against widespread or prolonged declines in
the stock market.



<R>

CREDIT RISKS

</R>


Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a
security by failing to pay interest or principal when due. If an issuer
defaults, a Fund will lose money.

Many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services
such as Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Services.
These services assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood
of issuer default. Lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit
risk. If a security has not received a rating, a Fund must rely
entirely upon the Advisers credit assessment.

Fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit
risk by paying interest at a higher rate. The difference between the
yield of a security and the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a
comparable maturity (the spread) measures the additional interest paid
for risk. Spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic
or market conditions. A securitys spread may also increase if
the securitys rating is lowered, or the security is perceived
to have an increased credit risk. An increase in the spread will cause
the price of the security to decline.

Credit risk includes the possibility that a party to a transaction
(such as a repurchase agreement) involving a Fund will fail to meet
its obligations. This could cause a Fund to lose the benefit of the transaction
or prevent a Fund from selling or buying other securities to implement
its investment strategy.



<R>

INTEREST RATE RISKS

</R>
<R>


Prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest
rate changes for similar securities. Generally, when interest rates
rise, prices of fixed income securities fall. However, market factors,
such as the demand for particular fixed income securities, may cause
the price of certain fixed income securities to fall while the prices
of other securities rise or remain unchanged.



</R>
<R>


Interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed
income securities with longer durations. Duration measures the price
sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates.



</R>
<R>

RISKS RELATED TO INVESTING FOR VALUE

</R>
<R>


Due to their relatively low valuations, value stocks are typically
less volatile than growth stocks. For instance, the price of a value
stock may experience a smaller increase on a forecast of higher earnings,
a positive fundamental development, or positive market development.
Further, value stocks tend to have higher dividends than growth stocks.
This means they depend less on price changes for returns and may lag
behind growth stocks in an up market.



</R>
<R>

RISKS RELATED TO INVESTING FOR GROWTH

</R>
<R>


Due to their relatively high valuations, growth stocks are typically
more volatile than value stocks. For instance, the price of a growth
stock may experience a larger decline on a forecast of lower earnings,
a negative fundamental development, or an adverse market development.
Further, growth stocks may not pay dividends or may pay lower dividends
than value stocks. This means they depend more on price changes for
returns and may be more adversely affected in a down market compared
to value stocks that pay higher dividends.



</R>
<R>

RISKS RELATED TO COMPANY SIZE

</R>
<R>


Generally, the smaller the market capitalization of a company, the
fewer the number of shares traded daily, the less liquid its stock and
the more volatile its price. Market capitalization is determined by
multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current market
price per share.



</R>
<R>


Companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have
unproven track records, a limited product or service base and limited
access to capital. These factors also increase risks and make these
companies more likely to fail than larger, well capitalized companies.



</R>
<R>

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX CMOS

</R>
<R>


CMOs with complex or highly variable prepayment terms, such as companion
classes, IOs, POs, Inverse Floaters and residuals, generally entail
greater market, prepayment and liquidity risks than other mortgage-backed
securities. For example, their prices are more volatile and their trading
market may be more limited.



</R>

CALL AND PREPAYMENT RISKS

Call risk is the possibility that an issuer may redeem a fixed income
security before maturity (a call) at a price below its current
market price. An increase in the likelihood of a call may reduce the
securitys price.

If a fixed income security is called, a Fund may have to reinvest
the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates,
higher credit risks, or other less favorable characteristics.

Generally, homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages
at any time without penalty. Homeowners frequently refinance high interest
rate mortgages when mortgage rates fall. This results in the prepayment
of mortgage-backed securities with higher interest rates. Conversely,
prepayments due to refinancings decrease when mortgage rates increase.
This extends the life of mortgage-backed securities with lower interest
rates. As a result, increases in prepayments of high interest rate mortgage-backed
securities, or decreases in prepayments of lower interest rate mortgage-backed
securities, may reduce their yield and price. This relationship between
interest rates and mortgage prepayments makes the price of mortgage-backed
securities more volatile than most other types of fixed income securities
with comparable credit risks.


SECTOR RISKS

Companies with similar characteristics may be grouped together in
broad categories called sectors. Sector risk is the possibility that
a certain sector may underperform other sectors or the market as a whole.
As the Adviser allocates more of a Funds portfolio holdings to
a particular sector, a Funds performance will be more susceptible
to any economic, business or other developments which generally affect
that sector.



<R>

TAX RISKS

</R>
<R>


In order to be tax-exempt, municipal securities must meet certain
legal requirements. Failure to meet such requirements may cause the
interest received and distributed by a Fund to shareholders to be taxable.



</R>


Changes or proposed changes in federal tax laws may cause the prices
of municipal securities to fall.

Income from a Fund may be subject to the AMT.


DIVERSIFICATION RISKS

<R>


Compared to diversified mutual funds, a non-diversified fund may
invest a higher percentage of its assets among fewer issuers of portfolio
securities. This increases the West Virginia Municipal Bond Funds
risk by magnifying the impact (positively or negatively) that any one
issuer has on the West Virginia Municipal Bond Funds share price
and performance.



</R>
<R>

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS RISKS

</R>
<R>


An investment in an ETF generally presents the same primary risks
as an investment in a conventional fund (i.e., one that is not exchange
traded) that has the same investment objectives, strategies, and policies.
The price of an ETF can fluctuate up or down, and a Fund could lose
money investing in an ETF if the prices of the securities owned by the
ETF go down. In addition, ETFs may be subject to the following risks
that do not apply to conventional mutual funds: (i) the market price
of an ETFs shares may trade above or below their net asset value;
(ii) an active trading market for an ETFs shares may not develop
or be maintained; or (iii) trading of an ETFs shares may be halted
if the listing exchanges officials deem such action appropriate,
the shares are delisted from the exchange, or the activation of market-wide
circuit breakers (which are tied to large decreases in stock
prices) halts stock trading generally.



</R>

WEST VIRGINIA SECTOR RISKS

Because the West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund invests primarily
in issuers from a single state, the Fund may be subject to additional
risks compared to funds that invest in multiple states. West Virginias
economy is heavily dependent upon certain industries, such as coal mining,
manufacturing and tourism. Any downturn in these and other industries
may adversely affect the economy of the state.


What Do Shares Cost?
<R>

You can purchase, redeem, or exchange Shares any day the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Federal Reserve wire system are open. When
a Fund receives your transaction request in proper form, (as described
in this prospectus), it is processed at the next determined net asset
value (NAV) plus the applicable sales charge (public offering price).
From time to time a Fund may purchase foreign securities that trade
in foreign markets on days the NYSE is closed. The value of the Funds
assets may change on days you cannot purchase or redeem Shares.NAV is
determined at the end of regular trading (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern
time) each day the NYSE is open.

</R>
<R>

The Funds generally value equity securities according to the last sale price
  in the market in which they are primarily traded (either a national securities
  exchange or the over-the-counter market). The Funds generally value fixed income
  securities according to prices furnished by an independent pricing service,
  except that fixed income securities with remaining maturities of less than 60
  days at the time of purchase may be valued at amortized cost. For mortgage-backed
  securities, prices furnished by the independent pricing service are based on
  the aggregate investment value of the projected cash flows to be generated by
  the security. For other fixed income securities, prices furnished by an independent
  pricing service are intended to be indicative of the mean between the bid and
  asked prices currently offered to institutional investors for the securities.

</R>
<R>

Where a last sale price or market quotation for a portfolio security
is not readily available, and no independent pricing service furnishes
a price, the value of the security used in computing NAV is its fair
value as determined in good faith under procedures approved by the Funds
Board of Trustees (the Board). The Funds may use the
fair value of a security to calculate its NAV when, for example, (1) a
portfolio security is not traded in a public market or the principal
market in which the security trades is closed, (2) trading in a portfolio
security is suspended and not resumed prior to the normal market close,
(3) a portfolio security is not traded in significant volume for a substantial
period, or (4) the Funds Adviser determines that the quotation
or price for a portfolio security provided by a dealer or independent
pricing service is inaccurate.

</R>
<R>

Fair valuation procedures are also used where a significant event
affecting the value of a portfolio security is determined to have occurred
between the time as of which the price of the portfolio security is
determined and the NYSE closing time as of which a Funds NAV is
computed. An event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative
expectation that the securitys value will change in response to
the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change
in value. Significant events include significant general securities
market movements occurring between the time as of which the price of
the portfolio security is determined and the close of trading on the
NYSE. For domestic fixed income securities, such events may occur where
the cut-off time for the market information used by the independent
pricing service is earlier than the end of regular trading on the NYSE.
In such cases, use of fair valuation can reduce an investors ability
to seek to profit by estimating a Funds NAV in advance of the
time as of which NAV is calculated.

</R>
<R>

In some cases, events affecting the issuer of a portfolio security
may be considered significant events. Announcements concerning earnings,
acquisitions, new products, management changes, litigation developments,
a strike or natural disaster affecting the companys operations
or regulatory changes or market developments affecting the issuers
industry occurring between the time as of which the price of the portfolio
security is determined and the close of trading on the NYSE are examples
of potentially significant events. There can be no assurance that the
Fund could purchase or sell a portfolio security at the price used to
calculate the Funds NAV. In the case of fair valued portfolio
securities, lack of information and uncertainty as to the significance
of information may lead to a conclusion that a prior valuation is the
best indication of a portfolio securitys present value. Fair valuations
generally remain unchanged until new information becomes available.
Consequently, changes in the fair valuation of portfolio securities
may be less frequent and of greater magnitude than changes in the price
of portfolio securities valued at their last sale price, by an
independent pricing service, or based on market quotations.

</R>

The required minimum initial investment in each Fund is $1,000, unless
the investment is in an Individual Retirement Account, in which case
the minimum initial investment is $500. Subsequent investments in each
Fund must be in amounts of at least $100. These minimums may be waived
for purchases by the Trust Division of WesBanco for its fiduciary or
custodial accounts and WesBanco employees and members of their immediate
families. A Fund may waive the initial minimum investment from time
to time.
An institutional investors minimum investment is calculated
by combining all accounts it maintains with the Trust. Accounts established
through investment professionals may be subject to a smaller minimum
investment amount. Keep in mind that investment professionals may
charge you fees for their services in connection with your
Share transactions.

REDUCING THE SALES CHARGE WITH BREAKPOINT DISCOUNTS

</R>
<R>

Your investment may qualify for a reduction or elimination of the
sales charge, also known as a breakpoint discount. The breakpoint discounts
offered by the Funds are indicated in the tables above. You or your
investment professional must notify the Funds Transfer Agent of
eligibility for any applicable breakpoint discount at the time of purchase.

</R>
<R>

In order to receive the applicable breakpoint discount, it may be
necessary at the time of purchase for you to inform your investment
professional or the Transfer Agent of the existence of other accounts
in which there are holdings eligible to be aggregated to meet a sales
charge breakpoint (Qualifying Accounts). Qualifying Accounts
mean those Share accounts in the Funds held directly or through an investment
professional or a through a single-participant retirement account by
you, your spouse, your parents (if you are under age 21) and/or
your children under age 21, which can be linked using tax identification
numbers (TINs), social security numbers (SSNs) or broker identification
numbers (BINs). Accounts held through 401(k) plans and similar multi-participant
retirement plans, are not Qualifying Accounts.

</R>
<R>

In order to verify your eligibility for a breakpoint discount, you
will be required to provide to your investment professional or the Transfer
Agent certain information on your New Account Form and may be required
to provide account statements regarding Qualifying Accounts. If you
purchase through an investment professional, you may be asked to provide
additional information and records as required by the investment professional.
Failure to provide proper notification or verification of eligibility
for a breakpoint discount may result in your not receiving a breakpoint
discount to which you are otherwise entitled. Breakpoint discounts apply
only to your current purchase and do not apply retroactively to previous
purchases. The sales charges applicable to the Shares offered in this
prospectus, and the breakpoint discounts offered with respect to such
Shares, are described in full in this prospectus. Because the prospectus
is available on the WesMark Funds website free of charge, the Funds
do not disclose this information separately on the website.

</R>
<R>

Contingent upon notification to the Transfer Agent, the sales
charge at purchase, may be reduced or eliminated by:

</R>
<R>

Larger Purchases

</R>
<R>


purchasing Shares in greater quantities to reduce the applicable
sales charge; or



</R>


investments of $1,000,000 or more;



<R>

Concurrent Purchases

</R>

combining concurrent purchases of Shares:
    -by you, your spouse, and your children under age 21; or


<R> 
-of two or more Wesmark funds; 

</R>
<R>

Accumulated Purchases

</R>


accumulating purchases (in calculating the sales charge on an additional
purchase, include the current value of previous Share purchases still
invested in the Funds); or



<R>


if your account was opened prior to October 1, 1999, all subsequent
purchases will not be subject to the sales charge.



</R>
<R>

Letter of Intent

</R>
<R>


by signing a Letter of Intent committing to purchase a certain amount
of the WesMark Funds Shares within a 13-month period to combine
such purchases in calculating the sales charge. The Funds custodian
will hold Shares in escrow equal to the maximum applicable sales charge;



</R>
<R>

Reinvestment Privilege

</R>


reinvesting within 120 days of redeeming Shares of an equal or greater
amount;



<R>

Purchases by Affiliates of the Fund

trust and fiduciary accounts of WesBanco;



</R>
<R>


certain defined benefit/contribution plans; or



</R>
<R>


employees, directors and officers of WesBanco, Federated and their
affiliates, and members of their immediate families;



</R>
<R>

Waiver of Sales Charge by Investment Professionals

</R>
<R>


investors purchasing through investment professionals who choose
to waive the sales charge; and



</R>
<R>

Pursuant to the Exchange Privilege

</R>
<R>


exchanges from any WesMark Fund into Institutional Service Shares
of Automated Cash Management Trust (a portfolio of Money Market Obligations
Trust), and any subsequent exchanges back into any WesMark Fund.



</R>

Contact WesMark Funds Shareholder Services (1-800-864-1013) or your account
  representative for further information on reducing or eliminating the sales charge.
How are the Funds Sold?
<R>

The Funds Distributor, Edgewood Services, Inc. (Distributor)
markets the Shares described in this prospectus to customers of WesBanco,
Inc. and its affiliates and institutions or individuals, directly from
a Fund or through investment professionals. The West Virginia Municipal
Bond Fund may not be a suitable investment for retirement plans or for
non-West Virginia taxpayers because it invests in West Virginia
tax exempt securities. When the Distributor receives marketing fees
and sales charges, it may pay some or all of them to investment professionals.
The Distributor is a subsidiary of Federated.

</R>
<R>

RULE 12b-1 PLAN

</R>

The Funds have adopted a Rule 12b-1 Plan, which allows them to pay
marketing fees to the Distributor and investment professionals for the
sale, distribution and customer servicing of the Funds Shares.
Because these Shares could pay marketing fees on an ongoing basis, your
investment cost may be higher over time than other Shares with different
sales charges and marketing fees. The Funds are not currently paying
or accruing fees under the Plan.

<R>

SERVICE FEES

</R>
<R>

The Funds may pay fees not to exceed 0.25% of average daily net assets
(Service Fees) to investment professionals or WesBanco, for providing
services to shareholders and maintaining shareholder accounts. WesBanco
may select others to perform these services for their customers and
may pay them fees.

</R>
<R>

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

</R>
<R>

From its own profits, the Adviser may compensate broker-dealers for
distribution and may from time to time enter into varying arrangements
with broker-dealers in this regard. This compensation is in addition
to other compensation that a broker-dealer may receive in connection
with the sale of Fund shares.

</R>
<R>

Additional Payments to Financial Institutions

</R>
<R>

The Distributor or Adviser may pay out of its own resources amounts
(including items of material value) to certain financial institutions
that support the sale of Shares or provide services to Fund shareholders.
The amounts of these payments could be significant, and may create an
incentive for the financial institution or its employees or associated
persons to recommend or sell Shares of the Funds to you. In some cases,
such payments may be made by or funded from the resources of companies
affiliated with the Adviser. These payments are not reflected in the
fees and expenses listed in the fee table section of the Funds
prospectus because they are not paid by the Funds.

</R>
<R>

These payments are negotiated and may be based on such factors as
the number or value of Shares that the financial institution sells or
may sell; the value of client assets invested; or the type and
nature of services or support furnished by the financial institution.
These payments may be in addition to payments made by the Funds to the
financial institution under a Rule 12b-1 Plan and/or Service Fees arrangement.
You can ask your financial institution for information about any payments
it receives from the Adviser, Distributor or the Funds and any services
provided.

</R>

shareholder registration.



<R>

A Medallion signature guarantee is designed to protect your account
from fraud. Obtain a Medallion signature guarantee from a bank or trust
company, savings association, credit union or broker, dealer, or securities
exchange member. A notary public cannot provide a signature guarantee.

</R>

PAYMENT METHODS FOR REDEMPTIONS
Your redemption proceeds will be mailed by check to your address
of record. The following payment options are available if you complete
the appropriate section of the New Account Form or an Account Service
Options Form. These payment options require a signature guarantee if
they were not established when the account was opened:

an electronic transfer to your account at a financial institution
that is an ACH member; or

wire payment to your account at a domestic commercial bank that
is a Federal Reserve System member.


Redemption in Kind
Although the Funds intend to pay Share redemptions in cash, they
reserve the right to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by
a distribution of a Funds portfolio securities.
LIMITATIONS ON REDEMPTION PROCEEDS
Redemption proceeds normally are wired or mailed within one business
day after receiving a request in proper form. Payment may be delayed
up to seven days:

to allow your purchase to clear;

during periods of market volatility; or

when a shareholders trade activity or amount adversely impacts
a Funds ability to manage its assets.


You will not accrue interest or dividends on uncashed checks from
a Fund if those checks are undeliverable and returned to the Fund.
REDEMPTIONS FROM RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
In the absence of your specific instructions, 10% of the value
of your redemption from a retirement account in a Fund may be withheld
for taxes. This withholding only applies to certain types of retirement
accounts.
EXCHANGE PRIVILEGES

<R>

You may exchange Shares of a Fund into Shares of another WesMark
Fund or into Institutional Service Shares of Automated Cash Management
Trust. To do this, you must:

</R>


ensure that the account registrations are identical;

meet any minimum initial investment requirements; and

receive a prospectus for the fund into which you wish to exchange.


An exchange is treated as a redemption and a subsequent purchase,
and is a taxable transaction.

<R>

A Fund may modify or terminate the exchange privilege at any time.
In addition, a Fund may terminate your exchange privilege if your exchange
activity is found to be excessive under the Funds frequent trading
policies. See Account and Share Information--Frequent Trading
Policies.

</R>

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL/ EXCHANGE PROGRAM
Complete the appropriate section of the New Account Form or an Account
Service Options Form or contact your investment professional or the
Fund. Your account value must be $10,000. This program may reduce, and
eventually deplete, your account. Payments should not be considered
yield or income. Generally, it is not advisable to continue to purchase
Shares subject to a sales charge while redeeming Shares using this program.
ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS
Telephone Transactions
The Funds will record your telephone instructions. If a Fund does
not follow reasonable procedures, it may be liable for losses due to
unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions.
Share Certificates
The Funds do not issue share certificates.
Account and Share Information
CONFIRMATIONS AND ACCOUNT STATEMENTS
You will receive confirmation of purchases, redemptions and exchanges
(except for systematic transactions). In addition, you will receive
periodic statements reporting all account activity, including systematic
transactions, dividends and capital gains paid.
DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS
Dividends of the Small Company Growth Fund and Growth Fund, if any,
are declared and paid quarterly. Dividends of the Balanced Fund are
declared and paid monthly, and dividends of the Bond Fund and Municipal
Bond Fund are declared daily and paid monthly. Dividends are paid to
all shareholders invested in the Funds on the record date. The record
date is the date on which a shareholder must officially own Shares in
order to earn a dividend.

<R>

In addition, the Funds pay any capital gains at least annually. Your
dividends and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested
in additional Shares without a sales charge, unless you elect cash payments.
If you purchase Shares just before a Fund record date for a dividend
or capital gain distribution, you will pay the full price for the Shares
and then receive a portion of the price back in the form of a taxable
distribution, whether or not you reinvest the distribution in Shares.
Therefore, you should consider the tax implications of purchasing Shares
shortly before a Fund record date for a dividend or capital gain. Contact
your investment professional or the Funds for information concerning
when dividends and capital gains will be paid.

</R>

ACCOUNTS WITH LOW BALANCES
Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts with low balances, non-retirement
accounts may be closed if redemptions or exchanges cause the account
balance to fall below $1,000. Before an account is closed, you will
be notified and allowed 30 days to purchase additional Shares to meet
the minimum.
TAX INFORMATION
The Funds send an annual statement of your account activity to assist
you in completing your federal, state and local tax returns. Fund distributions
of dividends and capital gains are taxable to you whether paid in cash
or reinvested in a Fund. Dividends are taxable as ordinary income; capital
gains are taxable at different rates depending upon the length of time
a Fund holds its assets.
The Small Company Growth Fund, Growth Fund, Balanced Fund and Bond
Fund distributions are expected to be both dividends and capital gains.

<R>

It is anticipated that the West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund distributions
will be primarily dividends that are exempt from federal income tax,
although a portion of the Funds dividends may not be exempt. Dividends
may be subject to state and local taxes. The Funds dividends will
be exempt from West Virginia state personal income tax to the extent
they are derived from interest on obligations exempt from such taxes.
Capital gains and non-exempt dividends are taxable whether paid in cash
or reinvested in the Fund.

</R>

Redemptions and exchanges are taxable sales. Please consult your
tax adviser regarding your federal, state, and local tax liability.

<R>

FREQUENT TRADING POLICIES

</R>
<R>

Frequent or short-term trading into and out of a Fund can have adverse
consequences for a Fund and shareholders who use the Fund as a long-term
investment vehicle. Such trading in significant amounts can disrupt
a Funds investment strategies (e.g., by requiring the Fund to
sell investments at inopportune times or maintain excessive short-term
or cash positions to support redemptions), increase brokerage and administrative
costs and affect the timing and amount of taxable gains distributed
by a Fund.

</R>
<R>

The Funds Board has approved policies and procedures intended
to discourage excessive frequent or short-term trading of the Funds
Shares. Trading in the Funds Shares is monitored in an effort
to identify disruptive trading activity. Trades into and out of the
Funds are monitored within a period of 30 days or less and in certain
cases within a period of 90 days or less. If, based upon the monitoring,
a shareholder is deemed to have engaged in potentially disruptive frequent
or short term trading of the Funds shares then the shareholder
will receive a letter to that effect and may be precluded from making
further purchases or exchanges of the Funds shares. No matter
how the Fund defines its limits on frequent trading of the Funds Shares,
other purchases and sales of the Funds Shares may have adverse
effects on the management of a Funds portfolio and its performance.

</R>
<R>

It is anticipated that a significant number of shares of the WesMark
Funds will be held by accounts established with WesBanco Trust and Investment
Services (WTIS). Purchase and sale decisions in such accounts are primarily
made by investment officers of WTIS. Such accounts will be monitored
and any instances of disruptive frequent or short term trading will
be researched and addressed with management of WTIS.

</R>
<R>

The Funds objective is that its restrictions on short-term
trading should apply to all shareholders regardless of the number or
type of accounts in which Shares are held. However, the Funds anticipate
that limitations on their ability to identify trading activity to specific
shareholders, including where shares are held through intermediaries
in multiple or omnibus accounts, will mean that these restrictions may
not be able to be applied uniformly in all cases.

</R>
<R>

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS INFORMATION

</R>
<R>

The disclosure policy of the Funds and the Adviser prohibits the
disclosure of portfolio holdings information to any investor or intermediary
before the same information is made available to other investors. Employees
of the Adviser or its affiliates who have access to nonpublic information
concerning the Funds portfolio holdings are prohibited from trading
securities on the basis of this information. Such persons must report
all personal securities trades and obtain pre-clearance for all personal
securities trades other than certain short term and U.S. Government
securities and mutual fund shares (other than the WesMark Funds).

</R>
<R>

Firms that provide administrative, custody, financial, accounting,
legal or other services to the Funds may receive nonpublic information
about Fund portfolio holdings for purposes relating to their services.
The Funds may also provide portfolio holdings information to publications
that rate, rank or otherwise categorize investment companies. Traders
or portfolio managers may provide interest lists to facilitate
portfolio trading if the list reflects only that subset of the portfolio
for which the trader or portfolio manager is seeking market interest.
A list of service providers, publications and other third parties who
may receive nonpublic portfolio holdings information appears in the
Appendix to this SAI.

</R>
<R>

The furnishing of nonpublic portfolio holdings information to any
third party (other than authorized governmental or regulatory personnel)
requires the prior approval of the Executive Vice President of the Adviser
and of the Chief Compliance Officer of the Funds. The Executive Vice
President of the Adviser and the Chief Compliance Officer will approve
the furnishing of nonpublic portfolio holdings information to a third
party only if they consider the furnishing of such information to be
in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In that regard,
and to address possible conflicts between the interests of Fund shareholders
and those of the Adviser and its affiliates, the following procedures
apply. No consideration may be received by the Fund, the Adviser, any
affiliate of the Adviser or any of their employees in connection with
the disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Before information
is furnished, the third party must agree that it will safeguard the
confidentiality of the information. Persons approved to receive nonpublic
portfolio holdings information will receive it as often as necessary
for the purpose for which it is provided. Such information may be furnished
as frequently as daily and often with no time lag between the date of the
information and the date it is furnished. The Board receives and
reviews annually a list of the persons who receive nonpublic portfolio
holdings information and the purposes for which it is furnished.

</R>
<R>

The Funds annual and semiannual reports, which contain complete
listings of the Funds portfolio holdings as of the end of the
Funds second and fourth fiscal quarters, may be accessed by calling
1-800-864-1013 or on the internet at www.wesmarkfunds.com,
then click on Fund Documents and select the appropriate
document. Complete listings of the Funds portfolio holdings as
of the end of the Funds first and third fiscal quarters may
be accessed by calling 1-800-864-1013 or on the WesMark website at www.wesmarkfunds.com,
click on Fund Documents and select the appropriate document.
Fiscal quarter information is made available on the website within 70
days after the end of the fiscal quarter. This information is also available
in reports filed with the SEC at the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

SECURITIES DESCRIPTIONS AND TECHNIQUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In  pursuing  their  investment  strategies,  the Funds may,  in addition to the
securities listed in the Funds' prospectus,  invest in the following  securities
for any purpose that is consistent with their investment objectives.

EQUITY SECURITIES

Equity securities  represent a share of an issuer's  earnings and assets,  after
the  issuer  pays its  liabilities.  A Fund  cannot  predict  the income it will
receive from equity  securities  because issuers generally have discretion as to
the payment of any dividends or distributions.  However, equity securities offer
greater potential for appreciation than many other types of securities,  because
their value  increases  directly  with the value of the issuer's  business.  The
following  describes  the  types of  equity  securities  in which  the Funds may
invest.


    Common Stocks
    Common stocks are the most common type of equity security.  While
    holders of common stocks may receive a portion of the issuer's
    earnings in the form of dividends, dividends are generally only
    paid after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred
    stockholders.  In addition, issuers generally have discretion as
    to the payment of any dividends. Therefore a Fund cannot predict
    the income it will receive, if any, from common stocks.  However,
    common stocks offer greater potential for appreciation than many
    other types of securities because their value generally increases
    with the value of the issuer's business.  As a result, changes in
    an issuer's earnings may directly influence the value of its
    common stock.


    Preferred Stocks
    Preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or
    distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common
    stock.  Some preferred stocks also participate in dividends and
    distributions paid on common stock.  Preferred stocks may also
    permit the issuer to redeem the stock.  The Funds may also treat
    such redeemable preferred stock as a fixed income security.
    Because preferred stock dividends usually must be paid before
    common stock dividends, preferred stocks generally entail less
    risk than common stocks.  However, preferred stocks do not
    represent a liability of the issuer and, therefore, do not offer
    as great a degree of protection of capital or assurance of
    continued income as investments in corporate debt securities.


    Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
    REITs are real estate investment trusts that lease, operate and
    finance commercial real estate. REITs are exempt from federal
    corporate income tax if they limit their operations and
    distribute most of their income. Such tax requirements limit a
    REIT's ability to respond to changes in the commercial real
    estate market.


    Warrants
    Warrants give a Fund the option to buy the issuer's equity
    securities at a specified price (the exercise price) at a
    specified future date (the expiration date). A Fund may buy the
    designated securities by paying the exercise price before the
    expiration date. Warrants may become worthless if the price of
    the stock does not rise above the exercise price by the
    expiration date. This increases the market risks of warrants as
    compared to the underlying security. Rights are the same as
    warrants, except companies typically issue rights to existing
    stockholders.

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

Fixed income securities pay interest,  dividends or distributions at a specified
rate.  The  rate  may  be a  fixed  percentage  of  the  principal  or  adjusted
periodically.  In addition, the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the
principal amount of the security, normally within a specified time. Fixed income
securities  provide more regular  income than equity  securities.  However,  the
returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with
the issuer's  earnings.  This limits the potential  appreciation of fixed income
securities as compared to equity securities.

A  security's  yield  measures  the  annual  income  earned on a  security  as a
percentage of its price. A security's yield will increase or decrease  depending
upon whether it costs less (a discount) or more (a premium)  than the  principal
amount. If the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity, the
price and yield on a discount  or  premium  security  may change  based upon the
probability of an early redemption.  Securities with higher risks generally have
higher yields.

The following describes the types of fixed income securities in which a Fund may
invest.


    Treasury Securities
    Treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal
    government of the United States. Treasury securities are
    generally regarded as having the lowest credit risks.


    Agency Securities
    Agency Securities. Agency securities are issued or guaranteed by
    a federal agency or other government sponsored entity (GSE)
    acting under federal authority. Some GSE securities are supported
    by the full faith and credit of the United States. These include
    the Government National Mortgage Association, Small Business
    Administration, Farm Credit System Financial Assistance
    Corporation, Farmer's Home Administration, Federal Financing
    Bank, General Services Administration, Department of Housing and
    Urban Development, Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private
    Investment Corporation, and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
    Authority Bonds.
    Other GSE securities receive support through federal subsidies,
    loans or other benefits. For example, the U.S. Treasury is
    authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities issued by
    (or otherwise make funds available to) the Federal Home Loan Bank
    System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National
    Mortgage Association, Student Loan Marketing Association, and
    Tennessee Valley Authority in support of such obligations.
    A few GSE securities have no explicit financial support, but are
    regarded as having implied support because the federal government
    sponsors their activities. These include the Farm Credit System,
    Financing Corporation, and Resolution Funding Corporation.
    Investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks,
    but not as low as Treasury securities.
    A Fund treats mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by a GSE as
    if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency. Although such a
    guarantee protects against credit risks, it does not reduce
    market and prepayment risks.

    Corporate Debt Securities
    Corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by
    businesses. Notes, bonds, debentures and commercial paper are the
    most prevalent types of corporate debt securities. A Fund may
    also purchase interests in bank loans to companies. The credit
    risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers.

    In addition, the credit risk of an issuer's debt security may
    vary based on its priority for repayment. For example, higher
    ranking (senior) debt securities have a higher priority than
    lower ranking (subordinated) securities. This means that the
    issuer might not make payments on subordinated securities while
    continuing to make payments on senior securities. In addition, in
    the event of bankruptcy, holders of senior securities may receive
    amounts otherwise payable to the holders of subordinated
    securities. Some subordinated securities, such as trust preferred
    and capital securities notes, also permit the issuer to defer
    payments under certain circumstances. For example, insurance
    companies issue securities known as surplus notes that permit the
    insurance company to defer any payment that would reduce its
    capital below regulatory requirements.


    Commercial Paper
    Commercial paper is an issuer's obligation with a maturity of
    less than nine months. Companies typically issue commercial
    paper to pay for current expenditures. Most issuers constantly
    reissue their commercial paper and use the proceeds (or bank
    loans) to repay maturing paper. If the issuer cannot continue to
    obtain liquidity in this fashion, its commercial paper may
    default. The short maturity of commercial paper reduces both the
    market and credit risks as compared to other debt securities of
    the same issuer.


    Bank Instruments
    Bank instruments are unsecured interest bearing deposits with
    banks. Bank instruments include bank accounts, time deposits,
    certificates of deposit and banker's acceptances. Yankee
    instruments are denominated in U.S. dollars and issued by
    U.S. branches of foreign banks. Eurodollar instruments are
    denominated in U.S. dollars and issued by non-U.S. branches of
    U.S. or foreign banks.


Mortgage Backed Securities

Mortgage  backed  securities  represent  interests  in pools of  mortgages.  The
mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates,  maturities
and  other  terms.  Mortgages  may have  fixed  or  adjustable  interest  rates.
Interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as ARMs.

Mortgage  backed  securities  come in a variety  of forms.  Many have  extremely
complicated   terms.  The  simplest  form  of  mortgage  backed  securities  are
pass-through  certificates.  An  issuer  of  pass-through  certificates  gathers
monthly payments from an underlying pool of mortgages.  Then, the issuer deducts
its  fees  and  expenses  and  passes  the  balance  of the  payments  on to the
certificate holders once a month. Holders of pass-through certificates receive a
pro rata share of all payments and pre-payments  from the underlying  mortgages.
As a result,  the  holders  assume all the  prepayment  risks of the  underlying
mortgages.

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)

CMOs,  including interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs),
allocate  payments and prepayments from an underlying  pass-through  certificate
among holders of different classes of mortgage backed  securities.  This creates
different prepayment and market risks for each CMO class.


    Sequential CMOs
    In a sequential pay CMO, one class of CMOs receives all
    principal payments and prepayments. The next class of CMOs
    receives all principal payments after the first class is paid
    off. This process repeats for each sequential class of CMO. As a
    result, each class of sequential pay CMOs reduces the prepayment
    risks of subsequent classes.


    PACs, TACs and Companion Classes
    More sophisticated CMOs include planned amortization classes
    (PACs) and targeted amortization classes (TACs). PACs and TACs
    are issued with companion classes. PACs and TACs receive
    principal payments and prepayments at a specified rate. The
    companion classes receive principal payments and prepayments in
    excess of the specified rate. In addition, PACs will receive the
    companion classes' share of principal payments, if necessary, to
    cover a shortfall in the prepayment rate. This helps PACs and
    TACs to control prepayment risks by increasing the risks to
    their companion classes.


    IOs and POs
    CMOs may allocate interest payments to one class (Interest Only
    or IOs) and principal payments to another class (Principal Only
    or POs). POs increase in value when prepayment rates increase.
    In contrast, IOs decrease in value when prepayments increase,
    because the underlying mortgages generate less interest
    payments. However, IOs tend to increase in value when interest
    rates rise (and prepayments decrease), making IOs a useful hedge
    against interest rate risks.


    Floaters and Inverse Floaters
    Another variant allocates interest payments between two classes
    of CMOs. One class (Floaters) receives a share of interest
    payments based upon a market index such as the London Interbank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR). The other class (Inverse Floaters)
    receives any remaining interest payments from the underlying
    mortgages. Floater classes receive more interest (and Inverse
    Floater classes receive correspondingly less interest) as
    interest rates rise. This shifts prepayment and interest rate
    risks from the Floater to the Inverse Floater class, reducing
    the price volatility of the Floater class and increasing the
    price volatility of the Inverse Floater class.


    Z Classes and Residual Classes
    CMOs must allocate all payments received from the underlying
    mortgages to some class. To capture any unallocated payments,
    CMOs generally have an accrual (Z) class. Z classes do not
    receive any payments from the underlying mortgages until all
    other CMO classes have been paid off. Once this happens, holders
    of Z class CMOs receive all payments and prepayments. Similarly,
    REMICs have residual interests that receive any mortgage
    payments not allocated to another REMIC class.

    The degree of increased or decreased prepayment risks depends
    upon the structure of the CMOs. However, the actual returns on
    any type of mortgage backed security depend upon the performance
    of the underlying pool of mortgages, which no one can predict
    and will vary among pools.


Asset Backed Securities

Asset  backed  securities  are  payable  from  pools of  obligations  other than
mortgages.  Most asset backed  securities  involve  consumer or commercial debts
with maturities of less than ten years. However, almost any type of fixed income
assets (including other fixed income  securities) may be used to create an asset
backed security.  Asset backed securities may take the form of commercial paper,
notes,  or pass through  certificates.  Asset backed  securities have prepayment
risks.  Like CMOs, asset backed  securities may be structured like floating rate
securities, IOs and POs.

Zero Coupon Securities

Zero coupon  securities  do not pay interest or principal  until final  maturity
unlike debt securities that provide periodic  payments of interest  (referred to
as a coupon payment).  Investors buy zero coupon securities at a price below the
amount payable at maturity.  The  difference  between the purchase price and the
amount  received at maturity  represents  interest on the zero coupon  security.
Investors  must wait until  maturity to receive  interest and  principal,  which
increases the interest rate and credit risks of a zero coupon security.

Credit Enhancement

Credit  enhancement  consists of an arrangement in which a company agrees to pay
amounts due on a fixed income security if the issuer defaults. In some cases the
company providing credit enhancement makes all payments directly to the security
holders  and  receives  reimbursement  from the  issuer.  Normally,  the  credit
enhancer has greater financial resources and liquidity than the issuer. For this
reason, the Adviser usually evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security
based solely upon its credit  enhancement.  Common  types of credit  enhancement
include  guarantees,  letters of credit, bond insurance and surety bonds. Credit
enhancement also includes  arrangements  where securities or other liquid assets
secure payment of a fixed income security. If a default occurs, these assets may
be sold  and the  proceeds  paid to  security  holders.  Either  form of  credit
enhancement  reduces  credit risks by providing  another source of payment for a
fixed income security.

Convertible Securities

Convertible securities are fixed income securities that a Fund has the option to
exchange  for equity  securities  at a specified  conversion  price.  The option
allows a Fund to realize  additional  returns if the market  price of the equity
securities  exceeds the  conversion  price.  For example,  a Fund may hold fixed
income  securities  that  are  convertible  into  shares  of  common  stock at a
conversion  price of $10 per share.  If the market value of the shares of common
stock reached $12, a Fund could realize an additional $2 per share by converting
its fixed income securities.

Convertible   securities  have  lower  yields  than   comparable   fixed  income
securities.  In  addition,  at the time a  convertible  security  is issued  the
conversion price exceeds the market value of the underlying  equity  securities.
Thus,  convertible  securities  may provide lower  returns than  non-convertible
fixed income securities or equity securities depending upon changes in the price
of the underlying equity securities.  However,  convertible  securities permit a
Fund to realize some of the  potential  appreciation  of the  underlying  equity
securities with less risk of losing its initial investment.

A Fund treats convertible  securities as both fixed income and equity securities
for  purposes of their  investment  policies and  limitations,  because of their
unique characteristics.


Tax Exempt Securities

Tax exempt  securities are fixed income securities that pay interest that is not
subject to  regular  federal  and/or  state  income  taxes.  Typically,  states,
counties,  cities and other political  subdivisions  and  authorities  issue tax
exempt securities.  The market categorizes tax exempt securities by their source
of repayment.

    General Obligation Bonds
    General obligation bonds are supported by the issuer's power to
    impose property or other taxes. The issuer must impose and
    collect taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the
    bonds. However, the issuer's authority to impose additional
    taxes may be limited by its charter or state law.


    Special Revenue Bonds
    Special revenue bonds are payable solely from specific revenues
    received by the issuer such as specific taxes, assessments,
    tolls, or fees. Special revenue bondholders may not collect from
    the municipality's general taxes or revenues. For example, a
    municipality may issue bonds to build a toll road, and pledge
    the tolls to repay the bonds. Therefore, a shortfall in the
    tolls could result in a default on the bonds.


    Private Activity Bonds
    Private activity bonds are special revenue bonds used to finance
    private entities.  For example, a municipality may issue bonds to
    finance a new factory to improve its local economy.  The
    municipality would lend the proceeds from its bonds to the
    company using the factory, and the company would agree to make
    loan payments sufficient to repay the bonds.  The bonds would be
    payable solely from the company's loan payments, not from any
    other revenues of the municipality.  Therefore, any default on
    the loan normally would result in a default on the bonds.

    The interest on many types of private activity bonds is subject
    to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).  A Fund may invest
    in bonds subject to AMT.

    Tax Increment Financing Bonds
    Tax increment financing (TIF) bonds are payable from increases in
    taxes or other revenues attributable to projects financed by the
    bonds.  For example, a municipality may issue TIF bonds to
    redevelop a commercial area.  The TIF bonds would be payable
    solely from any increase in sales taxes collected from merchants
    in the area.  The bonds could default if merchants' sales, and
    related tax collections, failed to increase as anticipated.

    Municipal Notes
    Municipal notes are short-term tax exempt securities.  Many
    municipalities issue such notes to fund their current operations
    before collecting taxes or other municipal revenues.
    Municipalities may also issue notes to fund capital projects
    prior to issuing long-term bonds.  The issuers typically repay
    the notes at the end of their fiscal year, either with taxes,
    other revenues or proceeds from newly issued notes or bonds.

    Variable Rate Demand Instruments
    Variable rate demand instruments are tax exempt securities that
    require the issuer or a third party, such as a dealer or bank, to
    repurchase the security for its face value upon demand.  The
    securities also pay interest at a variable rate intended to cause
    the securities to trade at their face value.  The Fund treats
    demand instruments as short-term securities, because their
    variable interest rate adjusts in response to changes in market
    rates, even though their stated maturity may extend beyond
    thirteen months.

    Municipal Leases
    Municipalities may enter into leases for equipment or
    facilities.  In order to comply with state public financing laws,
    these leases are typically subject to annual appropriation.  In
    other words, a municipality may end a lease, without penalty, by
    not providing for the lease payments in its annual budget.  After
    the lease ends, the lessor can resell the equipment or facility
    but may lose money on the sale.

   The Fund may invest in  securities  supported by pools of municipal
   leases.  The  most  common  type  of  lease  backed  securities  is
   certificates of participation  (COPs).  However,  the Fund may also
   invest directly in individual leases.

FOREIGN SECURITIES

Foreign  securities  are  securities of issuers based outside the United States.
The Funds consider an issuer to be based outside the United States if:

o    it is organized  under the laws of, or has a principal  office  located in,
     another country;

o    the principal trading market for its securities is in another country; or

o    it (or its  subsidiaries)  derived in its most current fiscal year at least
     50% of its total assets, capitalization, gross revenue or profit from goods
     produced, services performed, or sales made in another country.

Foreign securities are primarily  denominated in foreign currencies.  Along with
the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type, foreign
securities are subject to currency risks and risks of foreign investing. Trading
in certain foreign markets is also subject to liquidity risks.

   Depositary Receipts
   Depositary receipts represent interests in underlying shares
   issued by a foreign company. Depositary receipts are not traded
   in the same market as the underlying security. American
   Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are also traded in U.S. dollars,
   eliminating the need for foreign exchange transactions. The
   foreign securities underlying European Depositary Receipts
   (EDRs), Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), and International
   Depositary Receipts (IDRs), are traded globally or outside the
   United States. Depositary receipts involve many of the same risks
   of investing directly in foreign securities, including currency
   risks and risks of foreign investing.

   Foreign Exchange Contracts
   In order to convert U.S. dollars into the currency needed to buy
   a foreign security, or to convert foreign currency received from
   the sale of a foreign security into U.S. dollars, the
   International Equity Fund may enter into spot currency trades. In
   a spot trade, the Fund agrees to exchange one currency for
   another at the current exchange rate. The Fund may also enter
   into derivative contracts in which a foreign currency is an
   underlying asset. The exchange rate for currency derivative
   contracts may be higher or lower than the spot
   exchange rate. Use of these derivative contracts may increase or
   decrease the Fund's exposure to currency risks.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

Derivative contracts are financial  instruments that require payments based upon
changes in the values of  designated  (or  underlying)  securities,  currencies,
commodities,  financial indices or other assets. Some derivative contracts (such
as futures,  forwards and options) require  payments  relating to a future trade
involving the  underlying  asset.  Other  derivative  contracts  (such as swaps)
require  payments  relating to the income or returns from the underlying  asset.
The other party to a derivative contract is referred to as a counterparty.

Many derivative contracts are traded on securities or commodities exchanges.  In
this case, the exchange sets all the terms of the contract except for the price.
Investors  make payments due under their  contracts  through the exchange.  Most
exchanges require investors to maintain margin accounts through their brokers to
cover their potential obligations to the exchange.  Parties to the contract make
(or collect) daily payments to the margin  accounts to reflect losses (or gains)
in the value of their  contracts.  This  protects  investors  against  potential
defaults by the  counterparty.  Trading  contracts  on an  exchange  also allows
investors to close out their contracts by entering into offsetting contracts.

For example, a Fund could close out an open contract to buy an asset at a future
date by entering into an offsetting  contract to sell the same asset on the same
date. If the offsetting  sale price is more than the original  purchase price, a
Fund realizes a gain; if it is less, a Fund realizes a loss. Exchanges may limit
the amount of open contracts  permitted at any one time. Such limits may prevent
a Fund from closing out a position.  If this happens, a Fund will be required to
keep the contract open (even if it is losing money on the contract), and to make
any  payments  required  under the  contract  (even if it has to sell  portfolio
securities at  unfavorable  prices to do so).  Inability to close out a contract
could also harm a Fund by preventing it from  disposing of or trading any assets
it has been using to secure its obligations under the contract.

A  Fund  may  also  trade  derivative   contracts   over-the-counter   (OTC)  in
transactions  negotiated  directly  between  a Fund  and the  counterparty.  OTC
contracts do not  necessarily  have standard  terms,  so they cannot be directly
offset  with  other  OTC  contracts.   In  addition,  OTC  contracts  with  more
specialized terms may be more difficult to price than exchange traded contracts.

Depending  upon  how a Fund  uses  derivative  contracts  and the  relationships
between the market value of a  derivative  contract  and the  underlying  asset,
derivative  contracts  may  increase or  decrease a Fund's  exposure to interest
rate,  stock market,  currency and credit  risks,  and may also expose a Fund to
liquidity and leverage  risks.  OTC contracts also expose a Fund to credit risks
in the event that a counterparty defaults on the contract.

A Fund may  trade in the  following  types of  derivative  contracts,  including
combinations thereof:


   Futures Contracts

   Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
   purchase by another party of a specified amount of an underlying
   asset at a specified price, date, and time.  Entering into a
   contract to buy an underlying asset is commonly referred to as
   buying a contract or holding a long position in the asset.
   Entering into a contract to sell an underlying asset is commonly
   referred to as selling a contract or holding a short position in
   the asset.  Futures contracts are considered to be commodity
   contracts. Futures contracts traded OTC are frequently referred
   to as forward contracts.

   Options
   Options are rights to buy or sell an underlying asset or
   instrument for a specified price (the exercise price) during, or
   at the end of, a specified period. The seller (or writer) of the
   option receives a payment, or premium, from the buyer, which the
   writer keeps regardless of whether the buyer uses (or exercises)
   the option. Options can trade on exchanges or in the OTC market
   and may be bought or sold on a wide variety of underlying assets
   or instruments, including financial indices, individual
   securities, and other derivative instruments, such as futures
   contracts.  Options that are written on futures contracts will be
   subject to margin requirements similar to those applied to
   futures contracts.

   A Fund may:

o    Buy put options on portfolio securities, securities indices, and listed put
     options on futures  contracts in anticipation of a decrease in the value of
     the underlying asset;

o    Write covered call options on portfolio  securities and listed call options
     on futures contracts to generate income from premiums,  and in anticipation
     of a  decrease  or only  limited  increase  in the value of the  underlying
     asset.  If a call  written by a Fund is  exercised,  the Fund  foregoes any
     possible  profit  from an increase  in the market  price of the  underlying
     asset over the exercise price plus the premium received;

o    Write secured put options on portfolio  securities (to generate income from
     premiums,  and in anticipation  of an increase or only limited  decrease in
     the value of the underlying asset). In writing puts, there is a risk that a
     Fund may be required  to take  delivery  of the  underlying  asset when its
     current market price is lower than the exercise price;

o    When a Fund  writes  options  on futures  contracts,  it will be subject to
     margin requirements similar to those applied to futures contracts; and

o    Buy or write options to close out existing options positions.

   A Fund may also write call options on financial futures contracts
   to generate income from premiums, and in anticipation of a
   decrease or only limited increase in the value of the underlying
   asset. If a call written by a Fund is exercised, the Fund
   foregoes any possible profit from an increase in the market price
   of the underlying asset over the exercise price plus the premium
   received.

   A Fund may also write put options on financial futures contracts
   to generate income from premiums, and in anticipation of an
   increase or only limited decrease in the value of the underlying
   asset. In writing puts, there is a risk that a Fund may be
   required to take delivery of the underlying asset when its
   current market price is lower than the exercise price. When a
   Fund writes options on futures contracts, it will be subject to
   margin requirements similar to those applied to futures contracts.


MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE

The West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund may purchase municipal  securities covered
by insurance  which  guarantees  the timely payment of principal at maturity and
interest on such securities  ("Policy" or "Policies").  These insured  municipal
securities  are  either (1)  covered  by an  insurance  policy  applicable  to a
particular  security,  whether  obtained  by the issuer of the  security or by a
third party ("Issuer-Obtained  Insurance") or (2) insured under master insurance
policies issued by municipal bond insurers,  which may be purchased by the Fund.
The  premiums  for the  Policies  may be paid by the Fund  and the  yield on the
Fund's  portfolio  may be  reduced  thereby.  The Fund  may  require  or  obtain
municipal bond insurance when purchasing  municipal  securities  which would not
otherwise meet the Fund's quality standards. The Fund may also require or obtain
municipal  bond  insurance  when  purchasing  or  holding   specific   municipal
securities,  when, in the opinion of the Fund's  Adviser,  such insurance  would
benefit the Fund (for  example,  through  improvement  of  portfolio  quality or
increased liquidity of certain securities).  The Fund's Adviser anticipates that
between  30% and 70% of the Fund's  net assets  will be  invested  in  municipal
securities which are insured.

Issuer-Obtained  Insurance  policies are non-cancelable and continue in force as
long as the municipal  securities are outstanding and their respective  insurers
remain in  business.  If a  municipal  security  is covered  by  Issuer-Obtained
Insurance, then such security need not be insured by the Policies purchased by a
Fund.

The Fund may purchase two types of Policies  issued by municipal  bond insurers.
One type of Policy covers certain municipal securities only during the period in
which they are in the Fund's portfolio.  In the event that a municipal  security
covered by such a Policy is sold from a Fund, the insurer of the relevant Policy
will be liable for those  payments of interest and  principal  which are due and
owing at the time of the sale.

The other type of Policy covers municipal  securities not only while they remain
in the Fund's portfolio but also until their final maturity if they are sold out
of the Fund's portfolio, so that the coverage may benefit all subsequent holders
of those  municipal  securities.  The Fund will obtain  insurance  which  covers
municipal  securities  until final  maturity even after they are sold out of the
Fund's portfolio only if, in the judgment of the Adviser, the Fund would receive
net proceeds from the sale of those securities, after deducting the cost of such
permanent insurance and related fees, significantly in excess of the proceeds it
would receive if such municipal securities were sold without insurance. Payments
received  from  municipal   bond  issuers  may  not  be  tax-exempt   income  to
shareholders of the Fund.

The Fund may purchase  municipal  securities insured by Policies from MBIA Corp.
("MBIA"),  AMBAC Indemnity Corporation  ("AMBAC"),  Financial Guaranty Insurance
Company  ("FGIC"),  or any other  municipal  bond insurer  which is rated AAA by
S&P or Aaa by Moody's.  Each Policy  guarantees the payment of principal and
interest on those  municipal  securities it insures.  The Policies will have the
same general characteristics and features. A municipal security will be eligible
for coverage if it meets certain  requirements  set forth in the Policy.  In the
event  interest or principal on an insured  municipal  security is not paid when
due, the insurer  covering the  security  will be obligated  under its Policy to
make such payment not later than 30 days after it has been  notified by the Fund
that such  non-payment  has occurred.  MBIA,  AMBAC,  and FGIC will not have the
right to withdraw  coverage on securities  insured by their  Policies so long as
such securities  remain in the Fund's  portfolio,  nor may MBIA,  AMBAC, or FGIC
cancel their Policies for any reason except failure to pay premiums when due.

MBIA,  AMBAC,  and FGIC will reserve the right at any time upon 90 days' written
notice  to the Fund to  refuse to insure  any  additional  municipal  securities
purchased by the Fund after the effective date of such notice. The Fund reserves
the right to terminate any of the Policies if they  determine  that the benefits
to a Fund of having its portfolio insured under such Policy are not justified by
the expense involved.

Additionally, the Fund reserves the right to enter into contracts with insurance
carriers  other  than MBIA,  AMBAC,  or FGIC if such  carriers  are rated AAA by
S&P or Aaa by Moody's.

SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS

Repurchase Agreements

Repurchase  agreements are  transactions  in which a Fund buys a security from a
dealer or bank and agrees to sell the  security  back at a mutually  agreed upon
time and price. The repurchase price exceeds the sale price, reflecting a Fund's
return on the transaction.  This return is unrelated to the interest rate on the
underlying  security.  A Fund will enter into  repurchase  agreements  only with
banks and other recognized financial  institutions,  such as securities dealers,
deemed creditworthy by the Adviser.

The Funds'  custodian or  subcustodian  will take  possession of the  securities
subject to repurchase  agreements.  The Adviser or subcustodian will monitor the
value of the  underlying  security  each  day to  ensure  that the  value of the
security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price.

Repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements

Reverse repurchase  agreements are repurchase  agreements in which a Fund is the
seller (rather than the buyer) of the securities,  and agrees to repurchase them
at an agreed upon time and price. A reverse  repurchase  agreement may be viewed
as a type of borrowing by a Fund. Reverse  repurchase  agreements are subject to
credit risks. In addition,  reverse repurchase  agreements create leverage risks
because  a Fund must  repurchase  the  underlying  security  at a higher  price,
regardless of the market value of the security at the time of repurchase.

Delayed Delivery Transactions

Delayed  delivery   transactions,   including  when  issued  transactions,   are
arrangements in which a Fund buys  securities for a set price,  with payment and
delivery  of the  securities  scheduled  for a future  time.  During  the period
between  purchase and  settlement,  no payment is made by the Fund to the issuer
and no interest  accrues to the Fund. The Fund records the  transaction  when it
agrees to buy the securities  and reflects their value in determining  the price
of its shares. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these
transactions  so that the market values of the  securities  bought may vary from
the purchase prices.  Therefore,  delayed delivery  transactions create interest
rate risks for the Fund. Delayed delivery transactions also involve credit risks
in the event of a  counterparty  default.  These  transactions  create  leverage
risks.


    To Be Announced Securities (TBAs)
    As with other when-issued transactions, a seller agrees to issue
    a TBA security at a future date. However, the seller does not
    specify the particular securities to be delivered. Instead, a
    Fund agrees to accept any security that meets specified terms.
    For example, in a TBA mortgage-backed transaction, a Fund and
    the seller would agree upon the issuer, interest rate and terms
    of the underlying mortgages. However, the seller would not
    identify the specific underlying mortgages until it issues the
    security. TBA mortgage-backed securities increase interest rate
    risks because the underlying mortgages may be less favorable
    than anticipated by the Fund.


    Dollar Rolls
    Dollar rolls are transactions where a Fund sells mortgage backed
    securities with a commitment to buy similar, but not identical,
    mortgage-backed securities on a future date at a lower price.
    Normally, one or both securities involved are TBA
    mortgage-backed securities. Dollar rolls are subject to interest
    rate risks and credit risks.


Securities Lending

A Fund may lend  portfolio  securities  to  borrowers  that  the  Adviser  deems
creditworthy.  In return,  the Fund receives cash or liquid  securities from the
borrower as collateral.  The borrower must furnish additional  collateral if the
market value of the loaned securities increases. Also, the borrower must pay the
Fund  the  equivalent  of any  dividends  or  interest  received  on the  loaned
securities.

The Fund  will  reinvest  cash  collateral  in  securities  that  qualify  as an
acceptable  investment for the Fund. However,  the Fund must pay interest to the
borrower for the use of cash collateral.

Loans are subject to termination at the option of the Fund or the borrower.  The
Fund will not have the right to vote on securities  while they are on loan,  but
it will terminate a loan in anticipation of any important vote. The Fund may pay
administrative  and  custodial  fees  in  connection  with a loan  and may pay a
negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash collateral to a securities
lending agent or broker.

Securities  lending  activities  are subject to  interest  rate risks and credit
risks. These transactions create leverage risks.


INVESTING IN SECURITIES OF OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES

<R>

The Funds may invest its assets in  securities  of other  investment  companies,
including  the  securities  of money  market  funds  affiliated  with  Federated
Investors,  as an efficient  means of carrying out its  investment  policies and
managing its  uninvested  cash.  These other  investment  companies  are managed
independently of the Funds and incur additional  expenses.  Therefore,  any such
investment  by the Funds may be  subject to  duplicate  expenses.  However,  the
Adviser  believes that the benefits and  efficiencies  of this  approach  should
outweigh the additional expenses.

The Small Company Growth Fund, Growth Fund, Balanced Fund and Bond Fund may also
invest in ETFs. As with traditional  mutual funds, ETFs charge asset-based fees,
although these fees tend to be relatively  low. ETFs do not charge initial sales
charges or redemption  fees and investors pay only  customary  brokerage fees to
buy and sell ETF shares.

</R>

INVESTMENT RATINGS FOR INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES

The Adviser will  determinate  whether a security is investment grade based upon
the credit ratings given by one or more nationally  recognized  rating services.
For  example,  Standard  and  Poor's,  a  rating  service,  assigns  ratings  to
investment  grade  securities (AAA, AA, A, and BBB) based on their assessment of
the likelihood of the issuer's inability to pay interest or principal  (default)
when due on each  security.  Lower credit  ratings  correspond  to higher credit
risk.  If a security has not received a rating,  a Fund must rely  entirely upon
the Adviser's  credit  assessment  that the security is comparable to investment
grade.

INVESTMENT RISKS

There are many  factors  which may effect an  investment  in a Fund.  The Funds'
principal  risks are described in its  prospectus.  Additional  risk factors are
outlined below.

Interest Rate Risks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o    Prices of fixed  income  securities  rise and fall in  response to interest
     rate changes for similar securities.  Generally,  when interest rates rise,
     prices of fixed income securities fall.  However,  market factors,  such as
     the demand for particular fixed income  securities,  may cause the price of
     certain  fixed  income  securities  to  fall  while  the  prices  of  other
     securities rise or remain unchanged.

o    Interest  rate changes  have a greater  effect on the price of fixed income
     securities with longer  durations.  Duration measures the price sensitivity
     of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates.

Credit Risks

o    Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by
     failing to pay interest or  principal  when due. If an issuer  defaults,  a
     Fund will lose money.

o    Many fixed income  securities  receive credit ratings from services such as
     Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services.  These services assign
     ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default.  Lower
     credit  ratings  correspond  to higher  credit risk.  If a security has not
     received a rating,  a Fund must rely  entirely  upon the  Adviser's  credit
     assessment.

o    Fixed income  securities  generally  compensate  for greater credit risk by
     paying  interest at a higher rate.  The  difference  between the yield of a
     security  and the  yield  of a U.S.  Treasury  security  with a  comparable
     maturity  (the spread)  measures  the  additional  interest  paid for risk.
     Spreads may increase  generally  in response to adverse  economic or market
     conditions.  A security's spread may also increase if the security's rating
     is lowered,  or the security is perceived to have an increased credit risk.
     An increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to decline.

o    Credit  risk  includes  the  possibility  that  a  party  to a  transaction
     involving a Fund will fail to meet its obligations. This could cause a Fund
     to lose the benefit of the  transaction  or prevent a Fund from  selling or
     buying other securities to implement its investment strategy.


Call Risks

o    Call risk is the  possibility  that an  issuer  may  redeem a fixed  income
     security  before  maturity  (a call) at a price  below its  current  market
     price.  An increase in the  likelihood of a call may reduce the  security's
     price.

o    If a fixed  income  security  is called,  a Fund may have to  reinvest  the
     proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates, higher
     credit risks, or other less favorable characteristics.


Leverage Risks

o    Leverage  risk is created when an  investment  exposes a Fund to a level of
     risk that  exceeds  the  amount  invested.  Changes in the value of such an
     investment magnify the Fund's risk of loss and potential for gain.


Risks Related to Company Size

o    Generally,  the smaller the market  capitalization of a company,  the fewer
     the number of shares traded  daily,  the less liquid its stock and the more
     volatile its price. Market  capitalization is determined by multiplying the
     number of its outstanding shares by the current market price per share.

o    Companies  with smaller market  capitalizations  also tend to have unproven
     track  records,  a limited  product or service  base and limited  access to
     capital.  These factors also increase  risks and make these  companies more
     likely to fail than larger, well capitalized companies.

Risks of Foreign Investing

o    Foreign  securities  pose  additional  risks  because  foreign  economic or
     political conditions may be less favorable than those of the United States.
     Securities in foreign markets may also be subject to taxation policies that
     reduce returns for U.S. investors.

o    Foreign  companies  may  not  provide  information   (including   financial
     statements)  as  frequently  or to as great an extent as  companies  in the
     United States. Foreign companies may also receive less coverage than United
     States  companies by market analysts and the financial  press. In addition,
     foreign  countries  may lack uniform  accounting,  auditing  and  financial
     reporting  standards  or  regulatory   requirements   comparable  to  those
     applicable  to U.S.  companies.  These  factors  may prevent a Fund and its
     Adviser from obtaining information  concerning foreign companies that is as
     frequent,  extensive and reliable as the information  available  concerning
     companies in the United States.

o    Foreign  countries may have restrictions on foreign ownership of securities
     or may impose exchange controls,  capital flow restrictions or repatriation
     restrictions  which  could  adversely  affect  the  liquidity  of a  Fund's
     investments.

Currency Risks

o    Exchange rates for currencies  fluctuate daily. The combination of currency
     risk and market  risk tends to make  securities  traded in foreign  markets
     more volatile than securities traded exclusively in the U.S.

o    The Adviser  attempts to manage currency risk by limiting the amount a Fund
     invests  in  securities  denominated  in a  particular  currency.  However,
     diversification  will not protect a Fund against a general  increase in the
     value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.

Risks of Investing in Derivative Contracts

o    A Fund's use of derivative  contracts  involves  risks  different  from, or
     possibly  greater than, the risks  associated  with  investing  directly in
     securities and other traditional  investments.  First, changes in the value
     of the  derivative  contracts in which a Fund invests may not be correlated
     with  changes  in  the  value  of  the  underlying  asset  or if  they  are
     correlated, may move in the opposite direction than originally anticipated.
     Second, while some strategies involving  derivatives may reduce the risk of
     loss,  they may also reduce  potential  gains or, in some cases,  result in
     losses by  offsetting  favorable  price  movements in  portfolio  holdings.
     Third,  there is a risk that  derivatives  contracts  may be  mispriced  or
     improperly  valued and, as a result, a Fund may need to make increased cash
     payments to the  counterparty.  Finally,  derivative  contracts may cause a
     Fund to realize  increased  ordinary  income or  short-term  capital  gains
     (which are treated as ordinary income for Federal income tax purposes) and,
     as a result, may increase taxable distributions to shareholders. Derivative
     contracts  may also involve  other  risks,  such as stock  market,  credit,
     liquidity and leverage risks.

Liquidity Risks

o    Trading  opportunities  are more limited for equity securities that are not
     widely held. This may make it more difficult to sell or buy a security at a
     favorable  price or time.  Consequently,  a Fund may have to accept a lower
     price to sell a security, sell other securities to raise cash or give up an
     investment  opportunity,  any of which  could have a  negative  effect on a
     Fund's  performance.  Infrequent  trading of securities may also lead to an
     increase in their price volatility.

o    Liquidity risk also refers to the  possibility  that a Fund may not be able
     to sell a security or close out a derivative  contract when it wants to. If
     this  happens,  a Fund will be required to continue to hold the security or
     keep the position open, and the Fund could incur losses.

o    OTC  derivative  contracts  generally  carry  greater  liquidity  risk than
     exchange-traded contracts.


<R>

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS RISKS

o    An  investment  in an ETF  generally  presents the same primary risks as an
     investment in a conventional  fund (i.e.,  one that is not exchange traded)
     that has the same  investment  objectives,  strategies,  and policies.  The
     price of an ETF can  fluctuate  up or down,  and a Fund  could  lose  money
     investing  in an ETF if the  prices of the  securities  owned by the ETF go
     down. In addition,  ETFs may be subject to the following  risks that do not
     apply to  conventional  funds:  (i) the market price of an ETF's shares may
     trade above or below their net asset value;  (ii) an active  trading market
     for an ETF's shares may not develop or be  maintained;  or (iii) trading of
     an ETF's shares may be halted if the listing exchange's officials deem such
     action  appropriate,  the shares are  delisted  from the  exchange,  or the
     activation  of  market-wide  "circuit  breakers"  (which  are tied to large
     decreases in stock prices) halts stock trading generally.

WEST VIRGINIA INVESTMENT RISKS

Because  it is  invested  primarily  in  securities  issued by the State of West
Virginia,  its local governments and their agencies, the West Virginia Municipal
Bond Fund is subject to the risks of West  Virginia's  economy and the financial
conditions of the state and local government and agencies.

In 2004 West Virginia had approximately 1,815,354 citizens, a decrease from 2003
of 3,914 persons or 02%, compared to a 1% increase nationally. The 65+ age group
made up 14.9% of the state's  population in 2003,  making it the third oldest in
the nation  behind  Florida and  Pennsylvania.  Of the state's  citizens over 25
years old, 78.3% had completed high school or an  equivalency  program,  and 17%
had obtained bachelor  degrees,  compared to national figures of 83.6% and 26.5%
respectively.  The  state's  median  household  income in 2003 was  $31,008,  an
increase of 4% from 2000, compared to a national increase of 3.7%. Although this
increase was  comparable to the national  increase,  West Virginia  still ranked
50th in the nation for median household income.

West Virginia's  economy is heavily dependent on industries such as coal mining,
chemicals and manufacturing,  which are undergoing significant consolidation and
change.  It is also  dependent  on  governmental,  health  and  similar  service
industries. In many rural counties in the state, the area hospital and the local
school board are the primary employers.  However,  most of the state's hospitals
are  operating on slim margins,  and the school  enrollment is declining in most
areas. In 2003,  services made up 18% of the state's earnings,  while government
accounted for 18% and retail trade accounted for 12%. Since 1994,  manufacturing
jobs have steadily declined while service jobs have moved in lockstep upward. In
2003,  manufacturing  accounted  for 8.9% of the state's  earnings.  The current
ratio of service to  manufacturing  jobs is about 2-to-1.  The steel industry in
the state,  like most of the domestic steel industry,  has suffered losses.  The
coal  industry,  on the other hand,  has received a new  emphasis  from the Bush
administration's   energy  policies.   However,  the  coal  industry  faces  two
challenges:  the Kyoto  Treaty to reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and recent
litigation  significantly  curtailing  mountaintop mining.  These may affect the
economic  feasibility of conducting  mining  operations in the future.  Although
West Virginia is ranked second in the nation for coal production,  the number of
employees has decreased from 29,900 in 1990 to 15,200 in 2004. Nevertheless, due
to the  increasingly  strong  market for coal,  the coal mining  industry  added
almost 1600 jobs in 2001 and  approximately  700 jobs between 2003 and 2004. The
state  is also  focused  on  further  developing  its  tourist  industry,  which
generated $2.9 billion from over 39.8 million day visitors and $2.7 billion from
approximately  10.5  million  overnight  visitors  in  2003 (a  7.84%  increase,
compared to a 5.4% increase nationally).  Perhaps one of West Virginia's largest
assets is its surplus of power:  West Virginia has the highest  surplus of power
generated  and not used  within  the  state,  contrasted  with 25 states and the
District of Columbia,  which each had a power deficit during the first 10 months
of 2003 and had to import  power.  West  Virginia  ranks 15th in net  electrical
generation, while ranking 34th in electrical consumption.

Generally, the state continues to work toward diversification of its economy and
improvement  of its roads and other  infrastructure.  Both  efforts have yielded
some  success in recent  years.  The West  Virginia  Council for  Community  and
Economic  Development,  the public  organization that devises the strategic plan
for state economic  development,  continues to develop ?A Vision Shared,? a plan
for building a stronger economy in West Virginia.  One of the components of this
plan involves  strengthening current industries and recruiting new industries to
the state. Such target industries  include energy and environmental  technology,
and plastics, biotechnology and information technology, which have established a
strong presence in the northeast portion of the state.  Since 2000 approximately
25,700 new jobs have been created and approximately $6 billion in new investment
has  been  generated.   West  Virginia  has  focused   considerable  efforts  on
infrastructure,   including  roads,  schools,   water  and  sewer.  Since  1994,
approximately $8.2 billion has been invested in roads and bridges, and, in 2001,
the state issued the last in a series of $550 million in general obligation road
bonds. Since 1996, a total of $1.7 billion has been committed to water and sewer
projects and $300 million to other infrastructure projects across the state.

Despite the aforementioned job creation and new investment,  the state's economy
has  reflected the national  downward  trend.  Between 2000 and 2003,  the state
realized a loss of 731  businesses and 6300 jobs overall.  However,  in 2004 the
state added 3700 jobs. The  unemployment  rate in the state dropped from 6.1% in
2003 to 5.2% in 2004 as the nation's rate  remained  steady from 5.7% in January
2004 to 5.4% in December 2004.  Although the average  unemployment  rate in 2004
was in line with the national rate, West Virginia posted  unemployment  rates as
low as 4.3% during the year.

Recent  tax  reductions  implemented  through  state  legislative  action  or by
incorporation  of federal law include the ten-year  phase out of the health care
provider tax on individual providers, the phase out of the estate tax and income
deductions for bonus depreciation.  The West Virginia  Legislature has created a
Rainy Day Fund, which had a balance of  approximately  $79.3 million in December
2004. The State  Legislature  has developed and is complying with a 40-year plan
to eliminate the unfunded liability of certain state pension funds. In addition,
the State  Legislature  passed  legislation  during a special session in January
2005 authorizing voters to determine if the state may issue bonds to finance the
approximate  $5.5 billion  unfunded  liability of certain state  pension  funds.
Approximately $482 million of the state's revenue is attributable to the state's
lottery.  The state has since 1990 issued over $400  million in bonds for school
buildings  and  improvements  and for  economic  development,  to be repaid from
lottery  proceeds.  In 1999, the state  established the Tobacco  Settlement Fund
accounts.  As of November  2004,  approximately  $25.4 million  dollars is to be
appropriated  to smoking  cessation  programs and hospitals,  and  approximately
$196.4 million remains in a trust account to fund Medicaid, the Public Employees
Insurance  Agency  and  other  health  related  programs.  The  state  also  has
established  an  Income  Tax Free  Fund  Reserve  Account  to  insure  funds are
earmarked to pay state  personal  income tax refunds,  which as of December 2004
consists of $30.7  million.  In 2003,  the  Legislature  enacted  changes to the
workers?  compensation  and  medical  professional  liability  laws in  order to
alleviate  the strain that these two matters  place on the state's  economy.  In
addition,  legislation  was passed  during the January 2005  special  session to
address the workers' compensation fund deficit. Through an increase in the coal,
gas and timber  severance  taxes, a workers'  compensation  policy surcharge and
yearly  allocation of $ 9 million from the "purse fund" from the lottery and $30
million from the tobacco  settlement  funds,  $90 million dollars a year will be
placed  in a  workers'  compensation  deficit  reduction  fund to pay  the  debt
associated with the fund. In 2002, the State Legislature authorized the issuance
of  approximately   $200  million  in  additional  lottery  bonds  for  economic
development.  The bond  authorization  was part of an economic  and tax package,
which also included redevelopment districts and several tax credits,  enacted by
the  Legislature in its continuing  efforts to improve and diversify the state's
economy.  In January 2004,  these bonds were issued,  and the proceeds from this
issuance are  scheduled to fund  portions of 48 economic  development  projects,
which are expected to produce  approximately $1 billion in investment and 10,570
jobs in West Virginia.

FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

o    WesMark Small Company Growth Fund seeks capital appreciation.

o    WesMark Growth Fund seeks capital appreciation.

o    WesMark Balanced Fund seeks capital appreciation and income.

o    WesMark Bond Fund seeks high current income consistent with preservation of
     capital.

will invest its assets so that, under normal circumstances,  at least 80% of its
net assets are invested in obligations, the interest income from which is exempt
from federal  income tax and income taxes imposed by the State of West Virginia.
For the purposes of this policy,  the tax-free interest must not be a preference
item for purposes of computing AMT.

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS

Borrowing Money and Issuing Senior Securities

The Funds may borrow money, directly or indirectly,  and issue senior securities
to the maximum extent  permitted under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (1940
Act).

Diversification of Investments

With respect to  securities  comprising  75% of the value of their total assets,
the Growth Fund, Balanced Fund, Bond Fund and Small Company Growth Fund will not
purchase  securities of any one issuer (other than cash; cash items;  securities
issued or guaranteed  by the  government of the United States or its agencies or
instrumentalities  and  repurchase   agreements   collateralized  by  such  U.S.
government  securities;  and securities of other investment  companies) if, as a
result,  more than 5% of the value of each Fund's total assets would be invested
in the  securities  of that issuer,  or each Fund would own more than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of that issuer.

Underwriting

The Funds may not underwrite  the  securities of other issuers,  except that the
Funds may engage in  transactions  involving  the  acquisition,  disposition  or
resale  of its  portfolio  securities,  under  circumstances  where  they may be
considered to be an underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933.

Investing in Real Estate

The Funds may not purchase or sell real estate,  provided that this  restriction
does not prevent the Funds from  investing in issuers  which  invest,  deal,  or
otherwise  engage in  transactions  in real  estate  or  interests  therein,  or
investing in  securities  that are secured by real estate or interests  therein.
The  Funds  may  exercise  their  rights  under  agreements   relating  to  such
securities,  including the right to enforce security  interests and to hold real
estate  acquired  by reason of such  enforcement  until that real  estate can be
liquidated in an orderly manner.

Investing in Commodities

The Funds may not purchase or sell physical commodities, provided that the Funds
may purchase securities of companies that deal in commodities.

Lending Cash or Securities

The Funds may not make loans,  provided that this  restriction  does not prevent
the Funds from purchasing debt obligations, entering into repurchase agreements,
lending its assets to broker/dealers or institutional investors and investing in
loans, including assignments and participation interests.

Concentration of Investments

The Funds will not make  investments  that will result in the  concentration  of
their  investments  in the securities of issuers  primarily  engaged in the same
industry. Government securities,  municipal securities and bank instruments will
not be deemed to constitute an industry.  The investment of more than 25% of the
value  of  the  Fund's  total  assets  in  any  one  industry  will   constitute
"concentration."

The above  investment  limitations  cannot be changed  unless  authorized by the
board of  Trustees  (Board)  and by the "vote of a majority  of its  outstanding
voting  securities,"  as  defined  by the 1940  Act.  The  following  investment
limitations,  however, may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.
Shareholders  will be notified before any material  change in these  limitations
becomes effective.

Buying on Margin

The Funds will not purchase  securities  on margin,  provided that the Funds may
obtain short-term  credits necessary for the clearance of purchases and sales of
securities,  and further  provided  that the Funds may make  margin  deposits in
connection  with their use of financial  options and  futures,  forward and spot
currency   contracts,   swap  transactions  and  other  financial  contracts  or
derivative instruments.

Pledging Assets

The  Funds  will not  mortgage,  pledge,  or  hypothecate  any of their  assets,
provided  that this shall not apply to the transfer of  securities in connection
with any permissible borrowing or to collateral  arrangements in connection with
permissible activities.

Investing in Illiquid Securities

The Funds will not purchase  securities for which there is no readily  available
market,  or enter into repurchase  agreements or purchase time deposits maturing
in more than seven days, if immediately after and as a result, the value of such
securities would exceed, in the aggregate, 15% of each Fund's net assets.

Writing Covered Call Options and Purchasing Put Options

With  respect to the Bond Fund and the  Balanced  Fund,  the Fund will not write
call  options  on  securities  unless  the  securities  are  held in the  Fund's
portfolio  or unless the Fund is entitled to them in  deliverable  form  without
further payment or after  segregating cash in the amount of any further payment.
The Fund will not purchase put options on securities  unless the  securities are
held in the Fund's portfolio.

Except with respect to borrowing money, if a percentage limitation is adhered to
at the time of investment,  a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting
from any change in value,  or net assets will not result in a violation  of such
restriction.

As a matter of non-fundamental policy, for purposes of concentration policy, (a)
utility companies will be divided according to their services (for example, gas,
gas  transmission,   electric  and  telephone  will  be  considered  a  separate
industry);  (b) financial service companies will be classified  according to the
end users of their services (for example,  automobile finance,  bank finance and
diversified  finance  will each be  considered  a  separate  industry);  and (c)
asset-backed  securities will be classified  according to the underlying  assets
securing such  securities.  To conform to the current view of the SEC staff that
only domestic  bank  instruments  may be excluded  from  industry  concentration
limitations,  as a matter of non-fundamental  policy, the Funds will not exclude
foreign bank instruments from industry concentration limitation tests so long as
the policy of the SEC  remains  in  effect.  In  addition,  investments  in bank
instruments,  and investments in certain industrial  development bonds funded by
activities in a single industry,  will be deemed to constitute  investment in an
industry,  except when held for temporary defensive purposes.  The investment of
more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets in any one industry  will
constitute "concentration."

As a matter of non-fundamental  policy, for purposes of the commodities  policy,
investments in transactions  involving  futures  contracts and options,  forward
currency contracts,  swap transactions and other financial contracts that settle
by payment of cash are not deemed to be investments in commodities.

For purposes of its policies and limitations, the Funds consider certificates of
deposit and demand and time deposits  issued by a U.S. branch of a domestic bank
or savings association having capital,  surplus, and undivided profits in excess
of  $100,000,000  at the  time  of  investment  to be  "cash  items"  and  "bank
instruments".

DETERMINING MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES

Market values of each Fund's portfolio securities are determined as follows:

o    for equity  securities,  according  to the last sale price in the market in
     which they are primarily traded (either a national  securities  exchange or
     the over-the-counter market), if available;

o    in the absence of recorded  sales for equity  securities,  according to the
     mean between the last closing bid and asked prices;

o    futures  contracts  and  options  are  generally  valued at  market  values
     established  by the  exchanges  on which  they are  traded  at the close of
     trading on such exchanges.  Options traded in the  over-the-counter  market
     are  generally  valued  according  to the mean between the last bid and the
     last asked  price for the option as  provided  by an  investment  dealer or
     other  financial  institution  that  deals in the  option.  The  Board  may
     determine in good faith that another method of valuing such  investments is
     necessary to appraise their fair market value;

o    for mortgage-backed securities,  based on the aggregate investment value of
     the projected  cash flows to be generated by the security,  as furnished by
     an independent pricing service;

o    for fixed  income  securities,  according to the mean between bid and asked
     prices as furnished by an independent  pricing  service,  except that fixed
     income  securities  with  remaining  maturities of less than 60 days at the
     time of purchase may be valued at amortized cost; and

o    for all other  securities at fair value as  determined  in accordance  with
     procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Board.

Prices  provided by  independent  pricing  services  may be  determined  without
relying exclusively on quoted prices and may consider  institutional  trading in
similar groups of securities,  yield,  quality,  stability,  risk,  coupon rate,
maturity,  type of issue,  trading  characteristics,  and other  market  data or
factors.  From time to time,  when prices cannot be obtained from an independent
pricing service, securities may be valued based on quotes from broker-dealers or
other financial institutions that trade the securities.

Trading in Foreign Securities

Trading in foreign  securities  may be  completed  at times  which vary from the
closing of the New York Stock  Exchange  (NYSE).  In  computing  its NAV, a Fund
values  foreign  securities at the latest closing price on the exchange on which
they are traded  immediately  prior to the closing of the NYSE.  Certain foreign
currency  exchange  rates may also be determined at the latest rate prior to the
closing  of the NYSE.  Foreign  securities  quoted  in  foreign  currencies  are
translated into U.S. dollars at current rates. Occasionally,  events that affect
these  values and exchange  rates may occur  between the times at which they are
determined  and the closing of the NYSE.  If such events  materially  affect the
value of  portfolio  securities,  these  securities  may be valued at their fair
value as  determined  in good  faith  by a Fund's  Board,  although  the  actual
calculation may be done by others.

WHAT DO SHARES COST?

<R>

Each  Fund's  net asset  value  (NAV) per Share  fluctuates  and is based on the
market value of all securities and other assets of each Fund.

REDUCING THE SALES CHARGE WITH BREAKPOINT DISCOUNTS

Your  investment may qualify for a reduction or elimination of the sales charge,
also known as a breakpoint  discount.  The breakpoint  discounts  offered by the
Funds are indicated in the tables  above.  You or your  investment  professional
must  notify  the  Funds'  Transfer  Agent  of  eligibility  for any  applicable
breakpoint discount at the time of purchase.

In order to receive the applicable  breakpoint discount,  it may be necessary at
the time of  purchase  for you to inform  your  investment  professional  or the
Transfer  Agent of the  existence of other  accounts in which there are holdings
eligible  to be  aggregated  to  meet a  sales  charge  breakpoint  ("Qualifying
Accounts").  Qualifying  Accounts  mean those  Share  accounts in the Funds held
directly or through an investment professional or a through a single-participant
retirement  account by you, your spouse,  your parents (if you are under age 21)
and/or your children under age 21, which can be linked using tax  identification
numbers (TINs), social security numbers (SSNs) or broker identification  numbers
(BINs).  Accounts  held  through  401(k)  plans  and  similar  multi-participant
retirement plans, are not Qualifying Accounts.

In order to verify  your  eligibility  for a  breakpoint  discount,  you will be
required  to provide  to your  investment  professional  or the  Transfer  Agent
certain  information  on your New  Account  Form and may be  required to provide
account statements  regarding  Qualifying  Accounts.  If you purchase through an
investment professional,  you may be asked to provide additional information and
records as required by the  investment  professional.  Failure to provide proper
notification or verification of eligibility for a breakpoint discount may result
in your not receiving a breakpoint discount to which you are otherwise entitled.
Breakpoint  discounts  apply  only to your  current  purchase  and do not  apply
retroactively to previous purchases.  The sales charges applicable to the Shares
offered in this prospectus, and the breakpoint discounts offered with respect to
such Shares, are described in full in this prospectus. Because the prospectus is
available on the WesMark Funds website free of charge, the Funds do not disclose
this information separately on the website.

Contingent upon notification to the Transfer Agent, the
sales charge at purchase, may be reduced or eliminated by:

Larger Purchases

|X|  purchasing  Shares in greater  quantities  to reduce the  applicable  sales
     charge; or

|X|  investments of $1,000,000 or more;

Concurrent Purchases

-     combining concurrent purchases of Shares:
-     by you, your spouse, and your children under age 21; or
-     of two or more Wesmark funds;

Accumulated Purchases

o    accumulating  purchases (in  calculating  the sales charge on an additional
     purchase,  include the  current  value of previous  Share  purchases  still
     invested in the Funds); or

o    if your  account  was  opened  prior to October  1,  1999,  all  subsequent
     purchases will not be subject to the sales charge. (sigma)

Letter of Intent
|X|  by signing a Letter of Intent  committing  to purchase a certain  amount of
     the  WesMark  Funds'  Shares  within a  13-month  period  to  combine  such
     purchases in calculating the sales charge.  The Funds'  custodian will hold
     Shares in escrow equal to the maximum applicable sales charge;

Reinvestment Privilege
|X|  reinvesting  within  120 days of  redeeming  Shares of an equal or  greater
     amount;

Purchases by Affiliates of the Fund
|X|   trust and fiduciary accounts of WesBanco;
|X|   certain defined benefit/contribution plans; or
|X|   employees, directors and officers of WesBanco, Federated and
      their affiliates, and members of their immediate families;

Waiver of Sales Charge by Investment Professionals

|X|  investors  purchasing through investment  professionals who choose to waive
     the sales charge;

Pursuant to the Exchange Privilege

|X|  exchanges  from any  WesMark  Fund  into  Institutional  Service  Shares of
     Automated Cash  Management  Trust (a portfolio of Money Market  Obligations
     Trust), and any subsequent exchanges back into any WesMark Fund;


HOW ARE THE FUNDS SOLD?

Under the  Distributor's  Contract  with the Funds,  the  Distributor  (Edgewood
Services, Inc.) offers Shares on a continuous, best-efforts basis.

The Distributor  receives a front-end  sales charge on certain Share sales.  The
Distributor  pays all or a portion of this  charge to  investment  professionals
(including  WesBanco  Securities,  Inc.)  that are  eligible  to receive it (the
"Dealer Reallowance") for sales and/or  administration  services and retains any
remaining portion of the front-end sales charge.

</R>


RULE 12b-1 PLAN

As a  compensation  type  plan,  the  Rule  12b-1  Plan is  designed  to pay the
Distributor   (who  may  then  pay  investment   professional   such  as  banks,
broker/dealers,  trust departments of banks, and registered investment advisers)
for  marketing  activities  (such  as  advertising,  printing  and  distributing
prospectuses,  and providing incentives to investment  professionals) to promote
sales of Shares so that overall Fund assets are  maintained or  increased.  This
helps the Funds  achieve  economies  of scale,  reduce per Share  expenses,  and
provide  cash  for  orderly  portfolio  management  and  Share  redemptions.  In
addition,  the Funds'  service  providers  that  receive  asset-based  fees also
benefit from stable or increasing Fund assets.

The Funds may compensate the Distributor  more or less than its actual marketing
expenses.  In no event will a Fund pay for any expenses of the Distributor  that
exceed the maximum Rule 12b-1 Plan fee.

SERVICE FEES

The Funds may pay fees not to exceed 0.25% of average daily net assets  (Service
Fees) to  investment  professionals  or  WesBanco,  for  providing  services  to
shareholders and maintaining shareholder accounts. WesBanco may select others to
perform these services for their customers and may pay them fees.

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

From its own profits, the Adviser may compensate broker-dealers for distribution
and may from time to time enter into varying arrangements with broker-dealers in
this  regard.  This  compensation  is in addition to other  compensation  that a
broker-dealer may receive in connection with the sale of Fund shares.

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

The Distributor or Adviser may pay out of its own resources  amounts  (including
items of material value) to certain financial institutions that support the sale
of Shares  or  provide  services  to Fund  shareholders.  The  amounts  of these
payments  could be  significant,  and may create an incentive  for the financial
institution  or its employees or associated  persons to recommend or sell Shares
of the Funds to you. In some cases,  such payments may be made by or funded from
the resources of companies  affiliated with the Adviser.  These payments are not
reflected in the fees and expenses listed in the fee table section of the Funds'
prospectus because they are not paid by the Funds.

These  payments are negotiated and may be based on such factors as the number or
value of Shares that the financial  institution  sells or may sell; the value of
client assets invested;  or the type and nature of services or support furnished
by the financial institution. These payments may be in addition to payments made
by the Funds to the  financial  institution  under the Rule  12b-1  Plan  and/or
Service Fees arrangement. You can ask your financial institution for information
about any payments it receives  from the Adviser,  Distributor  or the Funds and
any services provided.

EXCHANGING SECURITIES FOR SHARES

You may contact your investment  professional to request a purchase of shares in
an exchange for  securities  you own.  The Funds  reserve the right to determine
whether to accept your  securities and the minimum  market value to accept.  The
Funds will value your  securities in the same manner as they value their assets.
This exchange is treated as a sale of your securities for federal tax purposes.

SUBACCOUNTING SERVICES

Certain   investment   professionals  may  wish  to  use  the  transfer  agent's
subaccounting system to minimize their internal recordkeeping requirements.  The
transfer  agent may  charge a fee based on the level of  subaccounting  services
rendered.  Investment  professionals  holding  shares  in a  fiduciary,  agency,
custodial,  or similar capacity may charge or pass through subaccounting fees as
part of or in addition to normal  trust or agency  account  fees.  They may also
charge fees for other  services  that may be related to the ownership of shares.
This information should,  therefore, be read together with any agreement between
the customer and the investment  professional about the services  provided,  the
fees charged for those services, and any restrictions and limitations imposed.

REDEMPTION IN KIND

Although the Funds  intend to pay Share  redemptions  in cash,  they reserve the
right, as described  below, to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by a
distribution of the Funds' portfolio securities.

Because the Funds have  elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the 1940 Act,
the Funds are obligated to pay Share  redemptions to any one shareholder in cash
only up to the lesser of  $250,000 or 1% of the net assets  represented  by such
Share class during any 90-day period.

Any Share  redemption  payment  greater  than this  amount  will also be in cash
unless the Funds' Board  determines  that payment  should be in kind.  In such a
case,  the Funds will pay all or a portion of the remainder of the redemption in
portfolio  securities,  valued in the same way as each Fund  determines its NAV.
The  portfolio  securities  will be selected  in a manner that the Funds'  Board
deems fair and equitable and, to the extent  available,  such securities will be
readily marketable.

Redemption in kind is not as liquid as a cash redemption.  If redemption is made
in kind, shareholders receiving the portfolio securities and selling them before
their maturity  could receive less than the  redemption  value of the securities
and could incur certain transaction costs.

MASSACHUSETTS PARTNERSHIP LAW

Under  certain  circumstances,  shareholders  may be held  personally  liable as
partners under  Massachusetts  law for  obligations of the Trust. To protect its
shareholders,  the Trust has  filed  legal  documents  with  Massachusetts  that
expressly  disclaim the liability of its shareholders for acts or obligations of
the Trust.

In the unlikely  event a shareholder is held  personally  liable for the Trust's
obligations,  the  Trust  is  required  by the  Declaration  of Trust to use its
property to protect or compensate the  shareholder.  On request,  the Trust will
defend any claim made and pay any judgment  against a shareholder for any act or
obligation of the Trust. Therefore, financial loss resulting from liability as a
shareholder  will occur only if the Trust itself cannot meet its  obligations to
indemnify shareholders and pay judgments against them.

ACCOUNT AND SHARE INFORMATION

VOTING RIGHTS

<R>

Each Share of each Fund gives the shareholder one vote in Trustee  elections and
other matters  submitted to shareholders  for vote. All Shares of the Trust have
equal voting rights,  except that in matters  affecting only a particular  Fund,
only Shares of that Fund are entitled to vote.

Trustees may be removed by the Board or by shareholders at a special meeting.  A
special  meeting of  shareholders  will be called by the Board upon the  written
request of shareholders who own at least 10% of the Trust's  outstanding  shares
of all series entitled to vote.

</R>

TAX INFORMATION

FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Funds intend to meet  requirements  of Subchapter M of the Internal  Revenue
Code (Code) applicable to regulated investment companies.  If these requirements
are not met, they will not receive  special tax treatment and will be subject to
federal corporate income tax.

Each Fund will be treated as a single,  separate  entity for federal  income tax
purposes so that  income  earned and  capital  gains and losses  realized by the
Trust's other portfolios will be separate from those realized by the Fund.

A Fund entitled to a loss  carry-forward,  may reduce the taxable income or gain
that a Fund would realize, and to which the shareholder would be subject, in the
future.

FOREIGN INVESTMENTS

If the Small  Company  Growth  Fund,  Growth  Fund,  Balanced  Fund or Bond Fund
purchase foreign  securities,  their investment income may be subject to foreign
withholding or other taxes that could reduce the return on these securities. Tax
treaties between the United States and foreign countries, however, may reduce or
eliminate the amount of foreign  taxes to which the Funds would be subject.  The
effective  rate of  foreign  tax  cannot be  predicted  since the amount of Fund
assets to be invested within various countries is uncertain.  However, the Funds
intend to operate so as to qualify for treaty-reduced tax rates when applicable.

Distributions from a Fund may be based on estimates of book income for the year.
Book income  generally  consists  solely of the coupon  income  generated by the
portfolio,  whereas  tax-basis  income includes gains or losses  attributable to
currency  fluctuation.  Due to  differences  in the  book and tax  treatment  of
fixed-income  securities  denominated in foreign currencies,  it is difficult to
project  currency  effects on an interim  basis.  Therefore,  to the extent that
currency  fluctuations  cannot be  anticipated,  a portion of  distributions  to
shareholders  could  later be  designated  as a return of  capital,  rather than
income,  for income tax purposes,  which may be of particular  concern to simple
trusts.

If a Fund  invests  in the  stock  of  certain  foreign  corporations,  they may
constitute  Passive Foreign  Investment  Companies (PFIC),  and the Funds may be
subject to federal income taxes upon disposition of PFIC investments.

If more than 50% of the  value of a Fund's  assets at the end of the tax year is
represented by stock or securities of foreign corporations,  the Fund intends to
qualify for certain Code stipulations  that would allow  shareholders to claim a
foreign tax credit or deduction on their U.S.  income tax returns.  The Code may
limit a shareholder's  ability to claim a foreign tax credit.  Shareholders  who
elect to deduct  their  portion of a Fund's  foreign  taxes rather than take the
foreign tax credit must itemize deductions on their income tax returns.

WEST VIRGINIA TAXES

Under  existing  West  Virginia  laws,  distributions  made by the West Virginia
Municipal Bond Fund will not be subject to the West Virginia personal income tax
to the extent that such distributions qualify as exempt-interest dividends under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and represent (i) interest income
from obligations of the United States and its  possessions;  or (ii) interest or
dividend income from obligations of any authority, commission or instrumentality
of the United  States or the State of West  Virginia  exempt  from state  income
taxes under the laws of the United States or of the State of West Virginia.  For
purposes of the West Virginia corporate income tax, a special formula is used to
compute the extent to which Fund distributions are exempt.

The Secretary of the  Department of Tax and Revenue has indicated on an informed
basis  that  Fund  shares  should  be  exempt  from  personal   property  taxes.
Shareholders  should  consult their own tax adviser for more  information on the
application of personal property taxes on Fund shares.

WHO MANAGES AND PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE FUNDS?

<R>

BOARD OF TRUSTEES

The Board is  responsible  for  managing  the Trust's  business  affairs and for
exercising all the Trust's  powers except those  reserved for the  shareholders.
The  following  tables give  information  about each Board member and the senior
officers of the Funds. Where required,  the tables separately list Board members
who are "interested persons" of the Funds (i.e., "Interested" Board members) and
those who are not (i.e.,  "Independent" Board members). The WesMark Fund Complex
consists  of  one  Investment  Company  (comprising  five  portfolios).   Unless
otherwise noted,  each Officer is elected  annually;  each Board member oversees
all portfolios in the WesMark Fund Complex; and serves for an indefinite term.

As of March, 2005, the Funds' Board and Officers as a group owned  approximately
less than 1% of the Funds' outstanding Shares.

INVESTMENT ADVISER

The Adviser conducts investment research and makes investment  decisions for the
Funds.

The investment  adviser of the Fund is a separately  identifiable  department or
division (SIDD) of WesBanco Bank,  Inc.,  which is a wholly owned  subsidiary of
WesBanco, Inc. (WesBanco),  a registered bank holding company.  WesBanco and its
subsidiaries  provide a broad range of  financial  services to  individuals  and
businesses in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The Adviser is a division of
a state chartered bank, which offers financial  services that include commercial
and  consumer  loans,  corporate,  institutional  and personal  trust  services.
Because of internal  controls  maintained by the Adviser to restrict the flow of
non-public  information,   Fund  investments  are  typically  made  without  any
knowledge  by  the  Adviser  of  WesBanco  Bank  or  its   affiliates'   lending
relationships with an issuer.

</R>

The Adviser shall not be liable to the Trust, the Funds, or any Fund shareholder
for any losses that may be sustained in the  purchase,  holding,  or sale of any
security  or for  anything  done or  omitted  by it,  except  acts or  omissions
involving  willful  misfeasance,   bad  faith,  gross  negligence,  or  reckless
disregard of the duties imposed upon it by its contract with the Trust.

As required by the 1940 Act, the Funds' Board has reviewed the Funds' investment
advisory  contract.  The Board's  decision to approve the contract  reflects the
exercise  of  its  business   judgment  on  whether  to  continue  the  existing
arrangements.  During  its  review of the  contract,  the Board  considers  many
factors,  among the most material of which are: the Funds' investment objectives
and long term performance;  the Adviser's management philosophy,  personnel, and
processes;  the preferences  and  expectations  of Fund  shareholders  and their
relative sophistication;  the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund
industry;  comparable fees in the mutual fund industry; the range and quality of
services provided to the Funds and its shareholders by the WesBanco organization
in addition to investment advisory services;  and a Fund's relationship to other
funds in the WesMark Family of Funds.

In  assessing  the  Adviser's  performance  of its  obligations,  the Board also
considers  whether  there  has  occurred  a  circumstance  or event  that  would
constitute  a reason for it to not renew an advisory  contract.  In this regard,
the Board is mindful of the potential  disruptions of the Funds'  operations and
various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a
decision to  terminate or not renew an advisory  contract.  In  particular,  the
Board  recognizes  that  most  shareholders  have  invested  in the Funds on the
strength  of  the  Adviser's   industry  standing  and  reputation  and  in  the
expectation  that the Adviser will have a continuing role in providing  advisory
services to the Fund.

The Board also considers the compensation and benefits  received by the Adviser.
This includes fees received for services provided to the Funds by other entities
in the WesBanco  organization and research services received by the Adviser from
brokers that execute Fund trades, as well as advisory fees. In this regard,  the
Board is aware that various courts have  interpreted  provisions of the 1940 Act
and have indicated in their decisions that the following factors may be relevant
to an adviser's compensation: the nature and quality of the services provided by
the  Adviser,  including  the  performance  of a  fund;  the  Adviser's  cost of
providing the services;  the extent to which the Adviser may realize  "economies
of scale" as a fund grows larger;  any indirect  benefits that may accrue to the
Adviser and its  affiliates  as a result of the  Adviser's  relationship  with a
fund;  performance and expenses of comparable funds; and the extent to which the
independent  Board  members are fully  informed  about all facts  bearing on the
Adviser's  service and fee. The Funds' Board is aware of these factors and takes
them into account in its review of the Funds' advisory contract.

The Board  considers  and weighs  these  circumstances,  and is  assisted in its
deliberations by the advice of independent  legal counsel.  In this regard,  the
Board requests and receives a significant  amount of information about the Funds
and the WesBanco  organization.  WesBanco  provides much of this  information at
each  regular  meeting  of  the  Board,  and  furnishes  additional  reports  in
connection with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contracts occurs. In between regularly  scheduled  meetings,  the Board
may receive  information  on particular  matters as the need arises.  Thus,  the
Board's  evaluation of an advisory contract is informed by reports covering such
matters as: the Adviser's investment philosophy,  personnel,  and processes; the
fund's  short-  and  long-term  performance  (in  absolute  terms  as well as in
relationship  to its  particular  investment  program and certain  competitor or
"peer  group"  funds),  and  comments on the reasons for  performance;  a fund's
expenses (including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of
a fund, both in absolute terms and relative to similar and/or  competing  funds,
with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense  limitations);  the use and
allocation  of brokerage  commissions  derived  from trading a fund's  portfolio
securities; the nature and extent of the advisory and other services provided to
a  fund  by the  Adviser  and  its  affiliates;  compliance  and  audit  reports
concerning the Funds and the WesBanco  companies that service them; and relevant
developments  in the mutual fund industry and how the funds and/or  WesBanco are
responding to them.

The Board also receives financial information about WesBanco,  including reports
on the compensation and benefits  WesBanco derives from its  relationships  with
the Funds.  These reports cover not only the fees under the advisory  contracts,
but also fees received by WesBanco's  subsidiaries  for providing other services
to the  Funds  under  separate  contracts  (e.g.,  for  serving  as  the  Funds'
custodian).  The reports also discuss any indirect  benefit  WesBanco may derive
from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute fund trades.

The Board bases its decision to approve an advisory  contract on the totality of
the  circumstances  and  relevant  factors,  and with a view to past and  future
long-term  considerations.  Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above are relevant to every fund, nor does the Board consider any one of them to
be determinative. Because the totality of circumstances includes considering the
relationship  of each fund to the WesBanco  family of funds,  the Board does not
approach  consideration  of every fund's  advisory  contract as if that were the
only fund offered by the Adviser.

Portfolio  managers use similar  investment  strategies to manage both the Funds
and other accounts. Material conflicts may arise in the allocation of investment
opportunities  between  the Funds and other  accounts  managed by the  portfolio
manager.  The Adviser has policies and procedures in place to address  conflicts
of  interest  if they  arise  in the  allocation  of  investment  opportunities.
Conflicts  may arise  relating to the use of  commissions  to purchase  research
related  services.  The Funds have  policies and  procedures  in place to ensure
security  transactions  in the Funds are  executed at the best prices  available
under prevailing market conditions  without taking into consideration any use of
commissions to purchase research related services.

CODE OF ETHICS RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL TRADING

As required by SEC rules,  the Funds,  its Adviser,  and their  Distributor have
adopted codes of ethics.  These codes govern  securities  trading  activities of
investment personnel, Fund Trustees, and certain other employees.  Although they
do permit these people to trade in  securities,  including  those that the Funds
could  buy,  as well as  Shares  of the  Fund,  they  also  contain  significant
safeguards  designed to protect the Funds and their  shareholders from abuses in
this area,  such as  requirements  to obtain prior  approval for, and to report,
particular transactions.

VOTING PROXIES ON FUND PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Proxy Policy and Proxy Procedures

The Funds  have  adopted  the  Adviser's  Proxy  Policies  and  Procedures.  The
Adviser's Proxy Policy provides  guidance on how the Adviser should vote various
proxy  matters.  On certain  matters the Proxy Policy  provides that the Adviser
will vote for or against  certain matters while other matters will be voted on a
"case by case" basis.

The Adviser's  Proxy  Procedures  entails the use of  Institutional  Shareholder
Services  ("ISS").   ISS  is  a  well-known  and  respected   organization  that
specializes in the analysis of corporate  governance and compensation  issues as
they  are  presented  to  institutional  shareholders.  Client  proxies  will be
delivered  directly to ISS, who will vote the proxies according to the ISS Proxy
Policy.  The proxies will then be presented to the Adviser for approval at which
time the Adviser may choose to  over-ride  the ISS vote if the  Adviser's  Proxy
Policy on a particular  issue is different from that of ISS. Items identified in
the  Adviser's  Proxy Policy to be  determined on a "case by case" basis will be
voted in  accordance  with the  recommendation  of ISS. Any  exceptions  must be
approved by the Senior Executive Officer of the Adviser or his designee.

Conflicts of Interests

The Proxy Policy of the Adviser states that, in the event of a conflict  between
the interests of the investment  adviser and its clients  (including the Funds),
the  Adviser  will  vote  the  proxy  in the  best  interests  of  its  clients.
Specifically,  the Proxy Policy  provides  that in the event of any potential or
actual  conflict of interest  relating to a particular  proxy proposal the proxy
will be voted in accordance with the Proxy Policy to the extent the Proxy Policy
provides that the Adviser will vote for or against such proposal.  To the extent
the  Policy  calls for the  proposal  to be voted on a "case by case"  basis the
Adviser,  depending  on the facts and  circumstances,  will  either (1) vote the
proxy  in  accordance  with the  recommendation  of ISS;  or (2) vote the  proxy
pursuant to client direction.

<R>

Proxy Voting Report

A description of the policies and procedures that the Funds use to determine how
to vote proxies  relating to securities held in a Fund's portfolio is available,
without charge and upon request,  by calling  1-800-864-1013.  A report on "Form
N-PX" of how the Funds voted any such  proxies  during the most recent  12-month
period ended June 30 is available without charge and upon request by calling the
Funds toll-free at  1-800-864-1013.  This information is also available from the
EDGAR database on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS INFORMATION

The disclosure  policy of the Funds and the Adviser  prohibits the disclosure of
portfolio holdings  information to any investor or intermediary  before the same
information  is made available to other  investors.  Employees of the Adviser or
its  affiliates who have access to nonpublic  information  concerning the Fund's
portfolio  holdings are prohibited from trading  securities on the basis of this
information.  Such persons must report all personal securities trades and obtain
pre-clearance  for all personal  securities trades other than certain short term
and U.S.  Government  securities  and mutual fund shares (other than the WesMark
Funds) . Firms that  provide  administrative,  custody,  financial,  accounting,
legal or other  services to the Funds may receive  nonpublic  information  about
Fund portfolio  holdings for purposes relating to their services.  The Funds may
also provide portfolio  holdings  information to publications that rate, rank or
otherwise  categorize  investment  companies.  Traders or portfolio managers may
provide  "interest" lists to facilitate  portfolio  trading if the list reflects
only that subset of the portfolio  for which the trader or portfolio  manager is
seeking market  interest.  A list of service  providers,  publications and other
third parties who may receive nonpublic  portfolio holdings  information appears
in the Appendix to this SAI. The  furnishing  of  nonpublic  portfolio  holdings
information to any third party (other than authorized governmental or regulatory
personnel)  requires the prior  approval of the Executive  Vice President of the
Adviser and of the Chief  Compliance  Officer of the Funds.  The Executive  Vice
President  of the  Adviser and the Chief  Compliance  Officer  will  approve the
furnishing of nonpublic portfolio holdings  information to a third party only if
they consider the furnishing of such  information to be in the best interests of
the Fund and its shareholders. In that regard, and to address possible conflicts
between  the  interests  of Fund  shareholders  and those of the Adviser and its
affiliates,  the following procedures apply. No consideration may be received by
the Fund, the Adviser, any affiliate of the Adviser or any of their employees in
connection  with  the  disclosure  of  portfolio  holdings  information.  Before
information is furnished,  the third party must agree that it will safeguard the
confidentiality  of the  information.  Persons  approved  to  receive  nonpublic
portfolio  holdings  information  will receive it as often as necessary  for the
purpose  for  which  it is  provided.  Such  information  may  be  furnished  as
frequently  as  daily  and  often  with  no time  lag  between  the  date of the
information  and the  date it is  furnished.  The  Board  receives  and  reviews
annually  a  list  of the  persons  who  receive  nonpublic  portfolio  holdings
information  and the purposes for which it is  furnished.  The Funds' annual and
semiannual  reports,  which contain  complete  listings of the Fund's  portfolio
holdings as of the end of the Funds' second and fourth fiscal  quarters,  may be
accessed by calling  1-800-864-1013 or on the internet at  www.wesmarkfunds.com,
then click on "Fund  Documents" and select the  appropriate  document.  Complete
listings of the Funds' portfolio  holdings as of the end of the Funds' first and
third  fiscal  quarters  may be  accessed  by calling  1-800-864-1013  or on the
WesMark website at  www.wesmarkfunds.com,  click on "Fund  Documents" and select
the appropriate  document.  Fiscal quarter  information is made available on the
website within 70 days after the end of the fiscal quarter.  This information is
also  available  in  reports  filed  with  the  SEC  at  the  SEC's  website  at
www.sec.gov. Additionally, summary portfolio for each calendar quarter is posted
on the Funds' website within 30 days (or the next business day) after the end of
the calendar quarter. The summary portfolio composition  information may include
identification  of a Fund's top ten  holdings,  a  percentage  breakdown  of the
portfolio  by  sector,   maturity  range  or  credit  quality.  To  access  this
information on the Funds'  website click on the applicable  Fund's name and then
click on the applicable document.

BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS

When selecting  brokers and dealers to handle the purchase and sale of portfolio
instruments,  the Adviser looks for prompt execution of the order at a favorable
price.  The  Adviser  will  generally  use those who are  recognized  dealers in
specific portfolio instruments,  except when a better price and execution of the
order can be obtained  elsewhere.  The  Adviser  may select  brokers and dealers
based on whether they also offer  research  services (as described  below).  The
Adviser  makes  decisions  on  portfolio  transactions  and selects  brokers and
dealers subject to review by the Funds' Board.

Investment  decisions  for a Fund are  made  independently  from  those of other
accounts  managed by the Adviser.  When a Fund and one or more of those accounts
invests  in,  or  disposes  of,  the same  security,  available  investments  or
opportunities  for sales will be allocated among the Funds and the account(s) in
a manner  believed by the Adviser to be equitable.  While the  coordination  and
ability to participate in volume transactions may benefit a Fund, it is possible
that this procedure could adversely impact the price paid or received and/or the
position obtained or disposed of by a Fund.

On January 31,  2005,  the Funds'  owned  securities  of the  following  regular
broker/dealers:  the Small Company Growth Fund owned:  AmeriTrade  holding Corp.
$323,250;  the Growth  Fund owned  E*Trade  Group Inc.,  $2,406,250,  and Morgan
Stanley,  $11,751,600;  the  Balanced  Fund  owned,  Merrill  Lynch  &  Co.,
$385,650, Bear Stearns CO., Inc., $1,007,170 and Morgan Stanley $2,664,150;  the
Bond Fund owned Goldman Sachs $4,076,600, Morgan Stanley, $7,053,770 and Merrill
Lynch & Co., $641,000.

Research Services

Research  services  may include  advice as to the  advisability  of investing in
securities;  security analysis and reports;  economic studies; industry studies;
receipt of quotations for portfolio evaluations;  and similar services. Research
services may be used by the Adviser in advising  other  accounts.  To the extent
that receipt of these services may replace services for which the Adviser or its
affiliates  might  otherwise have paid, it would tend to reduce their  expenses.
The  Adviser  and  its  affiliates  exercise  reasonable  business  judgment  in
selecting  those brokers who offer  brokerage  and research  services to execute
securities  transactions.  They determine in good faith that commissions charged
by such persons are reasonable in relationship to the value of the brokerage and
research services provided.

For the fiscal year ended,  January 31, 2005,  the Small  Company  Growth Fund's
Adviser  directed  brokerage  transactions  to certain  brokers  due to research
services they provided.  The total amount of these  transactions was $21,791,404
for which the Fund paid  $45,665 in  brokerage  commissions.  The Growth  Fund's
Adviser  directed  brokerage  transactions  to certain  brokers  due to research
services they provided.  The total amount of these transactions was $119,445,614
for which the Fund paid $125,835 in brokerage  commissions.  The Balanced Fund's
Adviser  directed  brokerage  transactions  to certain  brokers  due to research
services they provided.  The total amount of these  transactions was $19,935,326
for which the Fund paid $20,090 in brokerage commissions.

12b-1 FEES

The Funds did not pay or accrue 12b-1 fees during the fiscal year ended  January
31, 2005.  The Funds have no present  intention of paying or accruing 12b-1 fees
during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2006.

HOW DO THE FUNDS MEASURE PERFORMANCE?

The Funds may advertise  Share  performance by using the Securities and Exchange
Commission's  (SEC) standard methods for calculating  performance  applicable to
all mutual funds. The SEC also permits this standard performance  information to
be accompanied by non-standard performance information.

Unless otherwise  stated,  any quoted Share  performance  reflects the effect of
non-recurring charges, such as maximum sales charges, which, if excluded,  would
increase the total return and yield. The performance of shares depends upon such
variables as: portfolio quality;  average portfolio maturity;  type and value of
portfolio  securities;  changes in interest rates; changes or differences in the
Funds' expenses; and various other factors.

Share  performance  fluctuates  on a daily basis  largely  because net  earnings
and/or the value of portfolio  holdings  fluctuate daily.  Both net earnings and
offering  price per  Share are  factors  in the  computation  of yield and total
return.

<R>

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS AND YIELD

Total returns are given for the one-year,  five-year and/or start of performance
periods  ended  January 31,  2005.  Yield is given for the 30-day  period  ended
January 31, 2005.

*The Fund is the successor to the portfolio of a common trust fund (CTF) managed
by the Adviser. At the Fund's commencement of operations,  the CTF's assets were
transferred to the Fund in exchange for Fund shares. The quoted performance data
includes  performance for periods before each of the Fund's  registration became
effective on August 8, 2000 for WesMark  Small  Company  Growth Fund,  April 20,
1998,  for the WesMark  Balanced  Fund, and April 14, 1997, for the WesMark West
Virginia  Municipal Bond Fund, as adjusted to reflect the Fund's  expenses.  The
CTF was not  registered  under the 1940 Act and was therefore not subject to the
restrictions  under the 1940 Act. If the CTF had been registered  under the 1940
Act, the performance may have been adversely affected.

TOTAL RETURN

Total return  represents the change  (expressed as a percentage) in the value of
shares over a specific  period of time, and includes the  reinvestment of income
and capital gains distributions.

The average  annual  total return for shares is the average  compounded  rate of
return for a given period that would equate a $10,000 initial  investment to the
ending  redeemable  value of that  investment.  The ending  redeemable  value is
computed by  multiplying  the number of shares owned at the end of the period by
the NAV per Share at the end of the  period.  The number of shares  owned at the
end of the period is based on the number of shares purchased at the beginning of
the period with $10,000,  less any  applicable  sales charge,  adjusted over the
period  by any  additional  shares,  assuming  the  annual  reinvestment  of all
dividends  and  distributions.  Total  returns  after taxes are  calculated in a
similar manner, but reflect additional standard assumptions required by the SEC.

When  shares  of a Fund  are in  existence  for  less  than a year,  a Fund  may
advertise  cumulative total return for that specific period of time, rather than
annualizing the total return.

YIELD

The yield of shares is calculated by dividing: (i) the net investment income per
Share earned by the shares over a 30-day  period;  by (ii) the maximum  offering
price per Share on the last day of the period.  This  number is then  annualized
using  semi-annual  compounding.  This means that the amount of income generated
during the 30-day  period is assumed to be generated  each month over a 12-month
period  and is  reinvested  every six  months.  The yield  does not  necessarily
reflect income actually earned by shares because of certain adjustments required
by the  SEC  and,  therefore,  may  not  correlate  to the  dividends  or  other
distributions paid to shareholders.

To  the  extent  investment  professional  and  broker/dealers  charge  fees  in
connection with services  provided in conjunction  with an investment in shares,
the Share performance is lower for shareholders paying those fees.

TAX EQUIVALENCY TABLE

Set forth  below  are  samples  of  tax-equivalency  tables  that may be used in
advertising and sales  literature.  These tables are for  illustrative  purposes
only and are not  representative of past or future  performance of the Municipal
Bond  Fund.  The  interest  earned  by the  municipal  securities  owned  by the
Municipal Bond Fund generally  remains free from federal  regular income tax and
is often free from West Virginia taxes as well.  However,  some of the Municipal
Bond Fund's income may be subject to the AMT and state and/or local taxes.

PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS
Advertising and sales literature may include:

o    references  to  ratings,   rankings,   and  financial  publications  and/or
     performance comparisons of Shares to certain indices;

o    charts,  graphs and illustrations  using the Funds' returns,  or returns in
     general,   that  demonstrate   investment  concepts  such  as  tax-deferred
     compounding, dollar-cost averaging and systematic investment;

o    discussions  of economic,  financial and political  developments  and their
     impact on the securities market, including the portfolio manager's views on
     how such developments could impact the Funds; and

o    information  about  the  mutual  fund  industry  from  sources  such as the
     Investment Company Institute.

A Fund may compare its  performance,  or performance for the types of securities
in which it  invests,  to a variety of other  investments,  including  federally
insured bank products such as bank savings  accounts,  certificates  of deposit,
and Treasury bills.

A  Fund  may  quote  information  from  reliable  sources  regarding  individual
countries  and regions,  world stock  exchanges,  and  economic and  demographic
statistics.

You may use financial publications and/or indices to obtain a more complete view
of Share  performance.  When  comparing  performance,  you should  consider  all
relevant  factors such as the composition of the index used,  prevailing  market
conditions,  portfolio  compositions  of other funds,  and methods used to value
portfolio  securities and compute  offering  price.  The financial  publications
and/or indices which the Funds use in advertising may include:

Lipper, Inc.
Ranks funds in various fund categories by making comparative  calculations using
total  return.  Total  return  assumes the  reinvestment  of all  capital  gains
distributions  and income  dividends  and takes into  account  any change in net
asset value over a specified  period of time.  From time to time,  the Fund will
quote its Lipper ranking in the "growth funds" category in advertising and sales
literature.


Morningstar, Inc.
An independent  rating  service,  is the publisher of the bi-weekly  Mutual Fund
Values,  which rates more than 1,000  NASDAQ-listed  mutual  funds of all types,
according to their risk-adjusted  returns. The maximum rating is five stars, and
ratings are effective for two weeks.


Standard & Poor's Daily Stock Price Index of 500 Common Stocks (S&P 500)
Composite index of common stocks in industry,  transportation, and financial and
public utility  companies.  Can be used to compare to the total returns of funds
whose  portfolios are invested  primarily in common stocks.  In addition,  the S
& P 500 assumes  reinvestments of all dividends paid by stocks listed on its
index.  Taxes  due on any of  these  distributions  are  not  included,  nor are
brokerage or other fees calculated in the S & P figures.

Russell 1000 Growth Index
Consists of those Russell 2000  securities  with a  greater-than-average  growth
orientation.  Securities in this index tend to exhibit higher  price-to-book and
price-earnings ratios, lower dividend yields and higher forecasted growth rates.

Russell 2000 Index
A  broadly   diversified   index   consisting  of   approximately   2,000  small
capitalization common stocks that can be used to compare to the total returns of
funds whose  portfolios are invested  primarily in small  capitalization  common
stocks.

Lehman Brothers Five-Year State General Obligation Bonds
Index  comprised of all state  general  obligation  debt issues with  maturities
between  four and six years.  These bonds are rated A or better and  represent a
variety of coupon  ranges.  Index figures are total returns  calculated for one,
three, and twelve month periods as well as year-to-date.  Total returns are also
calculated as of the index inception, December 31, 1979.

Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate (Total) Index
Index  comprised of  approximately  5,000 issues which include:  non-convertible
bonds publicly  issued by the U.S.  government or its agencies;  corporate bonds
guaranteed by the U.S. government and quasi-federal  corporations;  and publicly
issued,  fixed rate,  non-convertible  domestic  bonds of companies in industry,
public utilities,  and finance. The average maturity of these bonds approximates
nine years. Tracked by Lehman Brothers, Inc., the index calculates total returns
for one-month, three-month, twelve-month, and ten-year periods and year-to-date.

Consumer Price Index
Generally considered to be a measure of inflation.

Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA")
An unmanaged index representing  share prices of major industrial  corporations,
public utilities, and transportation companies.  Produced by the Dow Jones &
Company, it is cited as a principal indicator of market conditions.

Bank Rate Monitor National Index
A financial reporting service which publishes weekly average rates of 50 leading
bank and thrift  institution money market deposit accounts.  The rates published
in the index  are an  average  of the  personal  account  rates  offered  on the
Wednesday  prior to the date of  publication  by ten of the  largest  banks  and
thrifts in each of the five largest  Standard  Metropolitan  Statistical  Areas.
Account  minimums range upward from $2,500 in each  institution  and compounding
methods vary. If more than one rate is offered,  the lowest rate is used.  Rates
are subject to change at any time specified by the institution.

The S&P/BARRA Value Index and the S&P/BARRA Growth Index
Constructed by Standard & Poor's and BARRA,  Inc., an investment  technology
and  consulting  company,  by separating the S&P 500 Index into value stocks
and growth stocks. The S&P/BARRA  Growth and S&P/BARRA Value Indices are
constructed  by dividing the stocks in the S&P 500 Index  according to their
price-to-book  ratios. The S&P/BARRA  Growth Index,  contains companies with
higher price-to-earnings  ratios, low dividends yields, and high earnings growth
(concentrated  in  electronics,  computers,  health care, and drugs).  The Value
Index  contains  companies  with lower  price-to-book  ratios and has 50% of the
capitalization  of the  S&P  500  Index.  These  stocks  tend to have  lower
price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, and low historical and predicted
earnings growth  (concentrated in energy,  utility and financial  sectors).  The
S&P/BARRA Value and S&P/BARRA Growth Indices are capitalization-weighted
and rebalanced semi-annually. Standard & Poor's/BARRA calculates these total
return indices with dividends reinvested.

Standard & Poor's Midcap 400 Stock Price Index
A composite index of 400 common stocks with market capitalizations  between $200
million and $7.5  billion in  industry,  transportation,  financial,  and public
utility companies.  The Standard & Poor's index assumes  reinvestment of all
dividends  paid  by  stocks  listed  on the  index.  Taxes  due on any of  these
distributions  are not included,  nor are brokerage or other fees  calculated in
the Standard & Poor's figures.

S&P 600 Small Cap Index
An unmanaged  capitalization-weighted index representing all major industries in
the small-range of the U.S. stock market.

Mutual Fund Market

INVESTMENT RATINGS

STANDARD AND POOR'S LONG-TERM DEBT RATING DEFINITIONS

AAA--Debt  rated AAA has the highest rating  assigned by Standard &  Poor's.
Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.

AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
and differs from the higher rated issues only in
small degree.

A--Debt  rated A has a strong  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay  principal
although it is somewhat more  susceptible  to the adverse  effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.

BBB--Debt  rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate  capacity to pay interest
and  repay  principal.   Whereas  it  normally  exhibits   adequate   protection
parameters,  adverse  economic  conditions  or changing  circumstances  are more
likely to lead to a weakened  capacity to pay interest and repay  principal  for
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.

BB--Debt  rated BB has less  near-term,  vulnerability  to  default  than  other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse  business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions  which  could  lead  to
inadequate  capacity to meet timely  interest  and  principal  payments.  The BB
rating  category  is also  used for debt  subordinated  to  senior  debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BBB-rating.

B--Debt  rated B has a greater  vulnerability  to default but  currently has the
capacity to meet interest payments and principal  repayments.  Adverse business,
financial,  or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to
pay interest and repay  principal.  The B rating  category is also used for debt
subordinated  to senior  debt that is  assigned  an actual or  implied BB or BB-
rating.

CCC--Debt rated CCC has a currently  identifiable  vulnerability to default, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet
timely  payment of interest and repayment of principal.  In the event of adverse
business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions,  it is not  likely  to have the
capacity to pay interest and repay  principal.  The CCC rating  category is also
used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied
B or B-rating.

CC--The rating CC typically is applied to debt  subordinated to senior debt that
is assigned an actual or implied CCC debt rating.

C--The rating C typically is applied to debt  subordinated  to senior debt which
is assigned an actual or implied  CCC-debt  rating.  The C rating may be used to
cover a situation where a bankruptcy  petition has been filed,  but debt service
payments are continued.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE LONG-TERM BOND RATING DEFINITIONS

AAA--Bonds which are rated AAA are judged to be of the best quality.  They carry
the smallest  degree of investment  risk and are  generally  referred to as gilt
edged.  Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change,  such changes as can be  visualized  are most  unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues.

AA--Bonds  which are rated AA are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the AAA group,  they  comprise  what are  generally  known as high
grade  bonds.  They are rated  lower  than the best  bonds  because  margins  of
protection may not be as large as in AAA securities or fluctuation of protective
elements  may be of greater  amplitude  or there may be other  elements  present
which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in AAA securities.

A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment  attributes and are
to be considered as upper medium grade  obligations.  Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.

BAA--Bonds which are rated BAA are considered as medium grade
obligations, (i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly
secured). Interest payments and principal security appear adequate
for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or
may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time.
Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact
have speculative characteristics as well.

BA--Bonds which are BA are judged to have speculative elements; their
future cannot be considered as well assured. Of ten the protection
of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby
not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future.
Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.

B--Bonds  which are rated B  generally  lack  characteristics  of the  desirable
investment.  Assurance of interest and principal  payments or of  maintenance of
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.

CAA--Bonds  which are  rated CAA are of poor  standing.  Such  issues  may be in
default or there may be present  elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.

CA--Bonds  which are rated CA represent  obligations  which are speculative in a
high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.

C--Bonds  which are rated C are the lowest  rated class of bonds,  and issues so
rated can be regarded as having  extremely  poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing.

FITCH RATINGS LONG-TERM DEBT RATING DEFINITIONS

AAA--Bonds  considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
The  obligor  has an  exceptionally  strong  ability to pay  interest  and repay
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.

AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,  although
not quite as strong as bonds  rated AAA.  Because  bonds rated in the AAA and AA
categories are not significantly  vulnerable to foreseeable future developments,
short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated F-1+.

A--Bonds  considered  to be  investment  grade and of high credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.

BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality.
The  obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay  principal is considered to be
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds,  and therefore  impair timely
payment.  The  likelihood  that the  ratings  of these  bonds  will  fall  below
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.

BB--Bonds are considered speculative.  The obligor's ability to pay interest and
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes.  However,
business and financial  alternatives  can be  identified  which could assist the
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.

B--Bonds  are  considered  highly  speculative.  While  bonds in this  class are
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal  and  interest  reflects the  obligor's  limited  margin of
safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the
life of the issue.

CCC--Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to  default.  The  ability to meet  obligations  requires  an  advantageous
business and economic environment.

CC--Bonds  are  minimally  protected.  Default  in payment  of  interest  and/or
principal seems probable over time.

C--Bonds are imminent default in payment of interest or principal.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS

Prime-1--Issuers  rated  Prime-1 (or  related  supporting  institutions)  have a
superior capacity for repayment of short-term  promissory  obligations.  Prime-1
repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics:

o    Leading market positions in well established industries.

o    High rates of return on funds employed.

o    Conservative  capitalization  structure with moderate  reliance on debt and
     ample asset protection.

o    Broad  margins in earning  coverage  of fixed  financial  charges  and high
     internal cash generation.

o    Well established access to a range of financial markets and assured sources
     of alternate liquidity.

Prime-2--Issuers  rated  Prime-1 (or  related  supporting  institutions)  have a
strong capacity for repayment of short-term  promissory  obligations.  This will
normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser
degree.  Earnings trends and coverage ratios,  while sound, will be more subject
to variation.  Capitalization  characteristics,  while still appropriate, may be
more affected by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.

STANDARD AND POOR'S COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS

A---This  designation  indicates  that the  degree  of safety  regarding  timely
payment is strong.  Those issues  determined to possess  extremely strong safety
characteristics are denoted with a plus sign (+) designation.

A-2--Capacity   for  timely   payment  on  issues  with  this   designation   is
satisfactory.  However,  the  relative  degree  of  safety is not as high as for
issues designated A-1.

FITCH RATINGS COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING DEFINITIONS

FITCH-1--(Highest  Grade)  Commercial  paper assigned this rating is regarded as
having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment.

FITCH-2--(Very  Good Grade) Issues  assigned this rating reflect an assurance of
timely payment only slightly less in degree than the strongest issues.

 Why Choose Green Century
Our three-pronged approach offers investors the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can.
 




1. Investing in Sustainable Companies




2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program




3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits






1. Sustainable Investment Strategy
For 25 years, Green Century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values. Green Century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance may offer financial advantages. For example, we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment, communities in which they operate, and public health, they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability, but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation.
Green Century offers three mutual funds:

The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental, social and governance performance.
The Green Century Equity Fund  invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longest-running socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index.
The Green Century Balanced Fund  invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds, which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide.





SRI and Values-Based Exclusions


Fossil fuel companies – coal, oil and gas


Nuclear power companies


Military weapons and civilian firearm companies


Producers of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)


Tobacco companies





Examples of Sustainable Companies with Outstanding ESG Ratings


Energy efficiency; Renewables; Water treatment & conservation; Air pollution control


Sustainable infrastructure and transportation


Companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts


Sustainable agriculture companies, including organic and natural food suppliers


Companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain



Green Century uses values-based or socially, responsible, and impact (SRI) investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries. This aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits, such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century also employs environmental, social, and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector.
While some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies, Green Century uses both to deliver high impact investments.

Fossil Fuel Free Investing:
Green Century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S. Our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest 200 fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves. Green Century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical and/or financial reasons, they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely.
Our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for, extract, process and refine, and transmit coal, oil and gas, as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves.
As more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free, we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind:
“Low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free. It might be, but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves, or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment.  Since there is no standardized characterization of the term, you should review the prospectus (see below) for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund. Note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption.
Review the prospectus. Marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion, such as avoiding fossil fuel companies, and should be spelled out in the prospectus. The prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives, investment strategies, risks, as well as other details. Without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus, an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in. Green Century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus. You can review the prospectus of the Green Century Funds by clicking here.
Our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets.

What about Performance?
There are growing concerns about investing in coal, oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices, capital expenditures on high-cost projects such as off-shore and Arctic drilling, and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets. Fossil Fuel Divestment at Green Century.
These concerns are just some of the reasons Green Century has a long-standing investment strategy of avoiding the worst polluting companies and instead investing in companies that are helping build a sustainable economy. Read one of these recent studies on performance by leading industry analysts:

2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program
Even corporate sustainability leaders have room for improvement, which is why Green Century works with dozens of companies every year to adopt stronger environmental practices and policies throughout their supply chains.
 
Forest Protection Campaign
Deforestation is a leading cause of increased carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate change. Deforestation also poses a number of tangible business risks, which could include but are not limited to, current legal liabilities in emerging markets, pending legislation, reputational risk, and the ability to access raw materials to maintain revenue streams.
To help curb climate change, and limit our investors’ risks, Green Century has launched a five-year campaign to help stop deforestation caused by the production of soy, cattle, timber, rubber, and palm oil in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. In addition to other successes, the campaign has helped secure a zero-deforestation commitment from Wilmar,* the world’s largest palm oil trader, that will avoid 1.5 gigatons of carbon pollution between 2015 and 2020.
To learn more about our efforts and successes regarding our commitment to help stop deforestation, please download Green Century’s Forest Protection Campaign four-pager below or visit our Forest Protection page.
Sustainable Agriculture Program
Sustainable agriculture is the production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming practices that protect the environment, human health, and animal well-being. It is this form of agriculture that will provide an increasing global population the ability to produce plentiful, healthful food well into the future without destroying the environment or threatening human health.
At Green Century, we are currently working to decrease antibiotic misuse, the use of confinement cages and gestation crates, and promoting plant-based proteins.
To learn more about our specific efforts and successes, please download Green Century’s Sustainable Agriculture Program two-pager below.

3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits

One-hundred percent of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds are used to support the environmental and public health work of non-profit organizations.
Currently, our non-profit owners are working toward ending the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms, banning fracking whenever possible, and securing carbon pollution regulations. And, to date, these organizations have accomplished incredible success, including:


Helping support a proposition that upheld a statewide ban on plastic bags in California
Gaining permanent protection of natural and archaeological wonders by creating three national monuments in California, Nevada and Texas
Securing protection for thousands of rivers and drinking supply sources across the country
Expanding solar energy through the Million Solar Roofs Initiative in California, influencing Massachusetts’ policy to power 50,000 homes with solar energy and securing pro-solar policies in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, New Jersey and North Carolina

 The Green Century Funds
Approach
Green Century is a leader in environmentally and socially responsible investing. Through our three-pronged approach, we offer investors the opportunity to make an impact in a way no other mutual fund family can: through investing in sustainable companies; our leading shareholder advocacy program; and our unique ownership, where 100% of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds can be used to support the environmental and public health work of our non-profit owners. 
Green Century believes that companies that seek to protect the environment by avoiding dangerous practices and policies may be more profitable in the long run since they may be likely to have less exposure to devalued or stranded carbon assets, they may avoid costly litigation, and may be better prepared for new regulatory restrictions. Green Century also believes that companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance factors and take proactive actions around public health and environmental issues may enjoy a competitive advantage in appealing to consumers concerned about a company’s commitment to sustainability, and avoid damage to their brands.
Investment Strategy
All our Funds avoid these dangerous industries and corporations:
• Fossil fuel companies
• Fossil fuel fired utilities and companies with carbon reserves
• Producers of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
• Civilian firearms and military weapons companies
• Nuclear power companies
• Companies that derive revenues from tobacco



And instead seek to invest in companies that:
• Have outstanding rankings on environmental factors, including performance on critical environmental impacts
• Apply extensive sustainability criteria throughout their supply chains
• Minimize risks to air, water and public health
• Act as socially responsible companies in the communities in which they operate
• Rank highly on governance factors
• Are environmental innovators such as energy efficiency and clean energy companies
• Are sustainable agriculture companies involved in natural and organic foods


The MSCI International Index Fund
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies in developed markets chosen for their outstanding environmental, social and governance factors.  This passively managed Fund invests in the stocks of companies included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn moreThe Equity Fund
The passively managed Green Century Equity Fund invests in the stocks of hundreds of U.S. companies that comprise the longest-running sustainability index, the MSCI KLD 400 Social ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn more The Balanced Fund

Five Reasons to Consider Divesting from Fossil Fuels








October 16, 2013Share this page:Facebook89Twitter0LinkedIn5
Click to view PDF version
Since fall 2012, colleges, churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by these actions, individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy. This moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change, while saving for their future.
Here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies:
1. Get Your Investments in Line with Your Values
Climate  change  is  a  serious  threat  to  our  society,  and  burning  fossil  fuels  is  a  main  cause  of worsening  floods,  droughts,  and  wildfires.  Many  investors  want  to  keep  their  investments  away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate. Divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike.
2. Reduce Corporate Influence on Energy Policy

Fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations, through lobbying in  state  capitols  and  Congress.  For  years,  this  power  has  helped  thwart  progress  on  the  policy solutions to climate change. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful South African divestment campaign, and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change.
3. Strengthen the Climate Movement
Climate change is so profound, and the solutions so wide-ranging, that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference. The divestment strategy is successfully engaging the  public.  A  coordinated  and  organized  climate  change  network  –  that  includes  mayors,  church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies.
4. May Reduce Exposure to Stranded Carbon Assets
The fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal, oil, and  gas  that  –  if  extracted  and  burned  –  will  release  five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe.* If governments restrict carbon emissions, companies owning those  fossil  fuel  reserves  may  not  be  able  to  extract  and sell them. The reserves may become stranded assets, and investors may then be left with devalued assets. Divesting now  could  allow  investors  to  reduce  their  exposure  to  a possible collapse of the so-called “carbon bubble.”
5. Reinvest in the Solutions
Once  divested  from  fossil  fuels,  investors  have  the opportunity to invest in forward-looking climate solutions, like companies specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other related climate mitigation strategies.
To learn more:
Visit greencentury.com/fossilfuelfree or call 1-800-93-GREEN (1-800-934-7336).
The Green Century Balanced Fund is already fully divested from fossil fuel companies and re-invested in green solutions.
The Green Century Equity Fund is divested from coal and major oil companies, and invests in the longest running socially responsible index.
Next Steps
Each investor must decide whether divesting from fossil fuels meets his or her objectives. But every day, more investors are deciding it is the right path forward.

 Why Choose Green Century
Our three-pronged approach offers investors the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can.
 




1. Investing in Sustainable Companies




2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program




3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits






1. Sustainable Investment Strategy
For 25 years, Green Century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values. Green Century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance may offer financial advantages. For example, we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment, communities in which they operate, and public health, they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability, but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation.
Green Century offers three mutual funds:

The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental, social and governance performance.
The Green Century Equity Fund  invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longest-running socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index.
The Green Century Balanced Fund  invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds, which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide.





SRI and Values-Based Exclusions


Fossil fuel companies – coal, oil and gas


Nuclear power companies


Military weapons and civilian firearm companies


Producers of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)


Tobacco companies





Examples of Sustainable Companies with Outstanding ESG Ratings


Energy efficiency; Renewables; Water treatment & conservation; Air pollution control


Sustainable infrastructure and transportation


Companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts


Sustainable agriculture companies, including organic and natural food suppliers


Companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain



Green Century uses values-based or socially, responsible, and impact (SRI) investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries. This aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits, such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century also employs environmental, social, and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector.
While some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies, Green Century uses both to deliver high impact investments.

Fossil Fuel Free Investing:
Green Century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S. Our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest 200 fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves. Green Century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical and/or financial reasons, they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely.
Our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for, extract, process and refine, and transmit coal, oil and gas, as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves.
As more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free, we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind:
“Low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free. It might be, but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves, or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment.  Since there is no standardized characterization of the term, you should review the prospectus (see below) for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund. Note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption.
Review the prospectus. Marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion, such as avoiding fossil fuel companies, and should be spelled out in the prospectus. The prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives, investment strategies, risks, as well as other details. Without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus, an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in. Green Century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus. You can review the prospectus of the Green Century Funds by clicking here.
Our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets.

What about Performance?
There are growing concerns about investing in coal, oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices, capital expenditures on high-cost projects such as off-shore and Arctic drilling, and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets. Fossil Fuel Divestment at Green Century.
These concerns are just some of the reasons Green Century has a long-standing investment strategy of avoiding the worst polluting companies and instead investing in companies that are helping build a sustainable economy. Read one of these recent studies on performance by leading industry analysts:

2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program
Even corporate sustainability leaders have room for improvement, which is why Green Century works with dozens of companies every year to adopt stronger environmental practices and policies throughout their supply chains.
 
Forest Protection Campaign
Deforestation is a leading cause of increased carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate change. Deforestation also poses a number of tangible business risks, which could include but are not limited to, current legal liabilities in emerging markets, pending legislation, reputational risk, and the ability to access raw materials to maintain revenue streams.
To help curb climate change, and limit our investors’ risks, Green Century has launched a five-year campaign to help stop deforestation caused by the production of soy, cattle, timber, rubber, and palm oil in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. In addition to other successes, the campaign has helped secure a zero-deforestation commitment from Wilmar,* the world’s largest palm oil trader, that will avoid 1.5 gigatons of carbon pollution between 2015 and 2020.
To learn more about our efforts and successes regarding our commitment to help stop deforestation, please download Green Century’s Forest Protection Campaign four-pager below or visit our Forest Protection page.
Sustainable Agriculture Program
Sustainable agriculture is the production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming practices that protect the environment, human health, and animal well-being. It is this form of agriculture that will provide an increasing global population the ability to produce plentiful, healthful food well into the future without destroying the environment or threatening human health.
At Green Century, we are currently working to decrease antibiotic misuse, the use of confinement cages and gestation crates, and promoting plant-based proteins.
To learn more about our specific efforts and successes, please download Green Century’s Sustainable Agriculture Program two-pager below.

3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits

One-hundred percent of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds are used to support the environmental and public health work of non-profit organizations.
Currently, our non-profit owners are working toward ending the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms, banning fracking whenever possible, and securing carbon pollution regulations. And, to date, these organizations have accomplished incredible success, including:


Helping support a proposition that upheld a statewide ban on plastic bags in California
Gaining permanent protection of natural and archaeological wonders by creating three national monuments in California, Nevada and Texas
Securing protection for thousands of rivers and drinking supply sources across the country
Expanding solar energy through the Million Solar Roofs Initiative in California, influencing Massachusetts’ policy to power 50,000 homes with solar energy and securing pro-solar policies in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, New Jersey and North Carolina

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and      
    summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.
