Early life[edit]
Kullman was born Ellen Jamison in Wilmington, Delaware,[5][6] the younger daughter of Joseph and Margaret Jamison.[5] She has two older brothers and an older sister.[5] Kullman attended Tower Hill School in Wilmington and then studied mechanical engineering at Tufts University, where she received her bachelor's degree in 1978.[5] In 1983, she received a master's degree in management from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[5]
Career[edit]




Kullman at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 30, 2009


Kullman began her business career at General Electric and joined DuPont in 1988 as marketing manager in the company's medical imaging business.[5][6] In her later role as executive vice president she was responsible for four of DuPont's business platforms as well as leading the company's growth in markets outside the USA.[5]
DuPont's board of directors elected Kullman President and a director of the company with effect from October 1, 2008 and Chief Executive Officer with effect from January 1, 2009.[7] She is the nineteenth executive, and the first woman, to lead the company in its 212-year history.[8] Fortune magazine named Kullman fifteenth in its list of the world's fifty most powerful women for 2008,[9] and fifth on the list for 2009[10] and 2010.[11] In 2014 she was ranked as the 31st most powerful woman in the world, up from 42nd in 2013.[3] The Wall Street Journal named her eighth on its 2008 list of "Women to Watch".[12]
Kullman was a director of General Motors from 2004-2008[13][14] and was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University in 2006.[15]
On October 30, 2009, DuPont announced that its board of directors had elected Kullman as Chair of the company effective December 31, 2009.[16][17]
She is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 - 2013.[18]
On June 6, 2013 the US-China Business Council announced that Kullman had been elected as its Chair.[19]
Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Kullman began her business career at General Electric and joined DuPont in 1988 as marketing manager in the company's medical imaging business.[5][6] In her later role as executive vice president she was responsible for four of DuPont's business platforms as well as leading the company's growth in markets outside the USA.[5]
DuPont's board of directors elected Kullman President and a director of the company with effect from October 1, 2008 and Chief Executive Officer with effect from January 1, 2009.[7] She is the nineteenth executive, and the first woman, to lead the company in its 212-year history.[8] Fortune magazine named Kullman fifteenth in its list of the world's fifty most powerful women for 2008,[9] and fifth on the list for 2009[10] and 2010.[11] In 2014 she was ranked as the 31st most powerful woman in the world, up from 42nd in 2013.[3] The Wall Street Journal named her eighth on its 2008 list of "Women to Watch".[12]
Kullman was a director of General Motors from 2004-2008[13][14] and was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University in 2006.[15]
On October 30, 2009, DuPont announced that its board of directors had elected Kullman as Chair of the company effective December 31, 2009.[16][17]
She is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 - 2013.[18]
On June 6, 2013 the US-China Business Council announced that Kullman had been elected as its Chair.[19]
Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Delaware's homegrown CEO fights for DuPont's futureSUBSCRIBE NOWto get full accessDelaware's homegrown CEO fights for DuPont's futureThose who best know Ellen J. Kullman say activist investor Nelson Peltz may have underestimated his opponent.Maureen Milford, The News JournalA leader through the battleChapter OneShare This Story83TweetShareSharePinEmailCommentThose who best know Ellen J. Kullman, chief executive of the DuPont Co., say activist investor Nelson Peltz may have underestimated his opponent.Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which owns 2.7 percent of the company's shares valued at $1.8 billion, has pushed for four of the 12 seats on DuPont's board so it can dramatically cut costs and turn the direction of the company. Trian won a bitter proxy fight against H.J. Heinz Co. in 2006, securing two seats on that company's board.In an interview with The News Journal, Peltz said the historic battle with DuPont is far more contentious.Kullman, a fourth-generation Delawarean, has given no ground. She paid little attention when Peltz criticized her for refusing to meet with him and for exercising options and selling more than half of her equity position – approximately $80 million worth of DuPont shares – a move Peltz claims demonstrates Kullman does not believe in the company she leads.Her defenders counter that Kullman is passionate about the long-term vision forged by her board and management team, and they relish in pointing out that since she took the helm in 2009 DuPont has cut costs, spun off business and seen its shares  nearly triple.Globally, Kullman is seen as a strong corporate leader who understands DuPont's 213-year legacy of scientific innovation. Locally, she is seen as having DuPont DNA in her veins, with her family's relationship with the company and the du Pont family dating to the 19th century."This is where Peltz made his big mistake," said Jim Horty, vice president of Commonwealth Trust Co., whose family has been friends with Kullman's family for generations. "He didn't realize where she's from and what she's made of. In most cases, at the companies that he's gone after, the CEOs are there for a period. They're not homegrown."Here, you've got someone who's a fourth generation Delawarean. Her family has been involved in the DuPont Co., worked as contractors and built homes for the family members. She's seen what the company can do for Delaware."Others outside Delaware praise Kullman's courageous stance against an activist investor.(Photo: AP)"An awful lot of CEOs say they celebrate Ellen like she's Joan of Arc. She's an inspiration for every CEO," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of Management. "They wish they had the personal strength and the board fortitude to fight this noble mission and not be held hostage by extortionists who want to put priceless assets up for fire sale auction."Bill George, former chief executive of Medtronic and a director of Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs, said Kullman has been "very strong and not reacted emotionally at all.""A lot of great scientific advances came from the labs in Wilmington, Delaware," said George, who is also a professor at Harvard Business School. "She realizes she's a steward for what came before. Not all CEOs care as much about their employees as she does."DuPont blasts Peltz in shareholder letterBoth Sonnenfeld and George believe Kullman's example may empower chief executives and boards to stand firm when under attack by an activist investor."I think that her model has been a rallying cry for others to stand up," Sonnenfeld said. "It give leaders the courage to do the right thing – to build long term enterprises."“I think that her model has been a rallying cry for others to stand up. It give leaders the courage to do the right thing – to build long term enterprises.”Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, Senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of ManagementThey point to a March 31 letter sent to chief executives and board chairmen by Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest money management firm with $4.7 trillion in assets under management. In it, Fink says BlackRock has engaged with companies, clients and regulators to instill the importance of taking a long-term approach to creating value that builds a better society and a stronger economy."We have done so in response to the acute pressure, growing with every quarter, for companies to meet short-term financial goals at the expense of building long-term value," Fink wrote. "This pressure originates from a number of sources – the proliferation of activist shareholders seeking immediate returns, the ever-increasing velocity of capital, a media landscape defined by the 24/7 news cycle and a shrinking attention span, and public policy that fails to encourage truly long-term investment."Fink wrote that CEOs and boards have a fiduciary duty to long-term investors, many of whom count on shares purchased from quality companies for their retirements."Successfully fulfilling that duty requires… that they [corporate leaders] resist the pressure of short-term shareholders to extract value from the company if it would compromise value creation for long-term owners…" Fink's letter says.Skip in SkipxEmbedxShareCLOSE
    CEO Ellen Kullman is leading DuPont Co. through a historic proxy war between DuPont and Peltz’s Trian Fund Management. With stakes high for the state, many say fate couldn’t have cast a better leader to engage in battle with a Wall Street hedge fund
    Understanding the DuPont legacyChapter TwoDuPont's CEO draws strength for the battle from her Delaware roots and her deep understanding of DuPont's legacy, Kullman's family and friends say.During much of the 20th century, DuPont was an industrial powerhouse pumping out innovative products every few years. The company began its research efforts in 1903 with the opening of the Experimental Station, one of the early industrial universities. DuPont hired full-time scientists to work on finding alternative uses for nitrocellulose, the main ingredient in gunpowder. By 1927, the company had built a basic research program that was protected from business pressures.Within 10 years, DuPont invented synthetic rubber and nylon, the first completely manmade fiber. These inventions became important tools used by the Allies during World War II.(Photo: Courtesy of Hagley Museum)At home, DuPont was a committed corporate citizen. Besides building a hotel, several country clubs and a theater for Broadway shows, du Pont family leaders built roads and schools. Employees served on school boards, volunteered at museums and worked at charitable organizations.In communications with employees, the company referred to the organization as "family." Until the late 20th century, Delaware natives would often say they were "working for DuPonts," mixing the company's name with the du Pont family. To others, it was known as "Uncle Dupy.""There was in the 20th century a sense of loyalty to the employees and a commitment to the community – and it went both ways," said Delaware historian Susan Mulchahey Chase.Although Kullman's parents didn't work for DuPont, she was steeped in that ethos, said Delaware historian Carol Hoffecker, who wrote "Corporate Capital" and whose father worked for DuPont."She has a genuine understanding and knowledge of what the community has been like in her lifetime and I would expect she knows how important it is to maintain," Hoffecker said.(Photo: Photo courtesy of the Healy family)And although the du Ponts are no longer running the company, they support Kullman in the proxy battle."I think she's absolutely doing the right thing," said Nathan Hayward III, a direct descendant of the founder E. I. du Pont. "She's dramatically improved the company's earnings. I hope very much for the community's and the company's sake that Mr. Peltz is not successful. I'll say this: If the family still owned 40 percent of the company, which they once did, this [proxy fight] wouldn't be an issue."Members of Kullman's big family, the Healys, said the du Pont and Healy families have had relationship dating to the 19th century. Kullman said in 2014 that she read books on Alfred I. du Pont, the family rebel. In 1902, he was instrumental in keeping the third generation of du Ponts from selling to a competitor. Du Pont, along with his cousins, T. Coleman and Pierre S. du Pont, created the modern DuPont Co."She considers [DuPont] a family and is trying keep that," said Kullman's brother, Brien Jamison. "A lot of people believe in her and that's what keeps her going."Stock performance among recent DuPont CEOsSince 1986, DuPont Co. has had five CEOs.

"I'll fix him," she said last week, signing her proxy ballot in favor of DuPont.She speaks for the clan. And there is little doubt that Ellen Kullman has the family's fighting spirit."If we're convinced something is right, it's right. There's no gray," said Jack Healy. "If we're convinced about something, we're in with both boots."During DuPont's post-World War II expansion, the Healys were an unusual family in Brandywine Hundred. Many who settled north of Wilmington in the 1950s were young professionals brought to Delaware by DuPont, Hercules Inc. and Atlas Powder Co.(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)The Healys, by contrast, have been in Delaware since the 1800s when John E. Healy, an Irish immigrant, came to Wilmington to work as a carpenter. He founded a construction company in 1891, served on Wilmington City Council and in the state General Assembly. The company built industrial buildings, churches and Chateau Country mansions. When Healy died in 1939, an editorial in The News Journal praised the patriarch as "a forthright man" who took pride in his work."He was a good citizen whose fair dealing and genial manner gained for him deserved esteem and friendship," the editor wrote. "In his death the city and state sustain a loss."In the 1940s, the Healys settled on a single street of custom-made homes off U.S. 202. Grandparents, children and grandchildren all lived houses on the street that ends in a cul-de-sac. People sometimes joked that is was "Healyville."The street was named Nenagh Drive for the Healy family's hometown in Ireland called County Tipperary."We're sort of like the Kennedys," the late John E. Healy II said in 1983. He worked for DuPont before joining the family's construction business, which built hospitals, office buildings and structures for DuPont. "We built a compound out there."Many Healys became entrepreneurs, running their own small businesses and that continues to this day.(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Kullman, was the youngest of four children born to Margaret Healy Jamison and Joseph F. Jamison Jr. The Jamisons, who started Brandywine Nurseries in 1946, lived at the top of Nenagh Drive in a stately, stone Colonial home.Joseph Jamison had served as the forester for the city of Wilmington.The Healy women worked side by side with the men in the various family businesses, family members said. Kullman's mother, who had an accounting degree and was a whiz at math, worked until she died in the Jamison's business as a corporate officer. The business on the Christina River is still in the Jamison family. Her brother, Jamie, 65, serves as president in charge of environmental and site management services. Her brother Brien, 61, is president in charge of landscape services.Toughness was a defining trait among the women in Kullman's family."They're tough as nails, but it comes out of old-fashioned family values and loyalty," said Kullman's first cousin, Sharon Kelly Baker.Baker, whose father was a DuPonter, said she is "enraged" at the Peltz proxy fight.Adds Jamie Jamison: "I was brought up in a matriarchal society. Women told me what to do. They did not sit around in the kitchen."Source: DuPont taking bids for hotel, country clubA look at DuPont if Peltz gets his wayGrowing up in WilmingtonChapter Four(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Nenagh Drive swarmed with Healy kids during the post-war baby boom and family members say there was always a Healy to play with or a Healy house to drop in for dinner.T.J. Healy, the oldest of the Healy kids born after World War II, said there were enough cousins on the street to put together their own baseball team. Gender wasn't a factor in who played, he said."I didn't have friends," Kullman said in 2014. "I had cousins."Kullman attended St. Mary Magdalen School, just a short walk from her home. In high school, she transferred to Tower Hill School, a private school spearheaded by Irenee and Lammot du Pont in 1919.At Tower Hill, Kullman played basketball and lacrosse. She graduated in 1974.(Photo: Photo submitted)"Back in high school, I saw some of the 'Irish Fight' in Ellen," said Wilmington lawyer Michael Kelly, who is not related to the family. "She worked very hard and was very competitive."Her brothers recall that Ellen showed early signs of leadership with the drive and determination to succeed. All the Jamison children were expected to work in the family business. Many Thanksgivings were spent unloading Christmas trees.Jamie Jamison recalled when construction work was underway at ICI Americas (the forerunner of AstraZeneca) off Concord Pike, the constant truck traffic was creating a dust problem. Ellen was assigned the job of keeping the construction site moist to prevent dust clouds.(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)The company's 1957 turquoise-and-white Chevy pick-up truck was outfitted with a water tank and Ellen was assigned the job of driving around and sprinkling the site."That was a stick shift, too," said her brother, Brien Jamison.Another time, the family decided Ellen would oversee the watering of plants at a landscaping job in Dover while she was home from college. Later on, Ellen's father sent his son Jamie down to see how she was doing. Jamie saw a young man moving the hoses and sprinklers."I knew then she was going to be great," said Jamie Jamison. "Because she could delegate."She also worked at John Wanamaker department store on Augustine Cut-off, her brothers say.After Tower Hill, Kullman got a degree in mechanical engineering from Tufts University. She worked in technical service and sales for Westinghouse and got her master's in business administration from Northwestern University. In 1983, she moved to General Electric. She joined DuPont in 1988.“I knew then she was going to be great. Because she could delegate.”Jamie Jamison, Ellen's brotherShe and her husband, Michael Kullman, 59, have three children: Maggie and twin sons, Stephen and David.Despite her success, Kullman has remained humble, family members say. Sonnenfeld of Yale agreed."She's so unpretentious," he said. "You know, I saw her waiting in an Amtrak line – and it was a long line – at Penn Station."A different timeChapter FiveToday, family members are quick to say how proud they are of Kullman."Words can't even describe it," said cousin Jack Healy.(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Others in Delaware and elsewhere also voice their support."I think she's got the heart and soul to do the right thing," said Dave English, former general manager of the DuPont Country Club. "You can't save your way into prosperity."Madan Joshi, a retired DuPont microbiologist, said he believes the company, employees, pensioners and community are lucky to have someone "who is not from somewhere else.""She's a local person who's saying: 'What's this guy [Peltz] doing?' I'm glad she's fighting. With Peltz, it's like he's buying a car and then saying he wants to take the engine out."Lawrence Hamermesh, a professor of corporate and business law at Widener Law School, said Kullman impresses him as a "tough business person.""The easiest thing to do is to be conciliatory and settle. She's taken a strong position that the company should not be run the way Trian is proposing. It takes some guts," he said.“She's taken a strong position that the company should not be run the way Trian is proposing. It takes some guts.”Lawrence Hamermesh, professor of corporate and business law at Widener Law SchoolAt the same time, many recognize that the DuPont they knew during the "Golden Age of Chemistry" is a thing of the past. While the "power of nostalgia" may lead people to think Kullman won't make the hard decisions, she's proven that she will, including spinning off the running of the theater, Hamermesh said."She has to work in an environment where she has to make some really tough decisions," Hoffecker said. "So she can't be sentimental."Still, family members are quick to point out that Kullman is in Delaware to stay, no matter the outcome of the proxy war."This is her home," her brother Brien Jamison said. "She's not going anywhere."DuPont through the yearsChapter SixView a larger version of the tlmeline.Contact Maureen Milford at (302) 324-2881 or mmilford@delawareonline.com.Share This Story83TweetShareSharePinEmailComment

Early life[edit]
Kullman was born Ellen Jamison in Wilmington, Delaware,[5][6] the younger daughter of Joseph and Margaret Jamison.[5] She has two older brothers and an older sister.[5] Kullman attended Tower Hill School in Wilmington and then studied mechanical engineering at Tufts University, where she received her bachelor's degree in 1978.[5] In 1983, she received a master's degree in management from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[5]
Career[edit]




Kullman at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 30, 2009


Kullman began her business career at General Electric and joined DuPont in 1988 as marketing manager in the company's medical imaging business.[5][6] In her later role as executive vice president she was responsible for four of DuPont's business platforms as well as leading the company's growth in markets outside the USA.[5]
DuPont's board of directors elected Kullman President and a director of the company with effect from October 1, 2008 and Chief Executive Officer with effect from January 1, 2009.[7] She is the nineteenth executive, and the first woman, to lead the company in its 212-year history.[8] Fortune magazine named Kullman fifteenth in its list of the world's fifty most powerful women for 2008,[9] and fifth on the list for 2009[10] and 2010.[11] In 2014 she was ranked as the 31st most powerful woman in the world, up from 42nd in 2013.[3] The Wall Street Journal named her eighth on its 2008 list of "Women to Watch".[12]
Kullman was a director of General Motors from 2004-2008[13][14] and was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University in 2006.[15]
On October 30, 2009, DuPont announced that its board of directors had elected Kullman as Chair of the company effective December 31, 2009.[16][17]
She is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 - 2013.[18]
On June 6, 2013 the US-China Business Council announced that Kullman had been elected as its Chair.[19]
Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Early life[edit]
Kullman was born Ellen Jamison in Wilmington, Delaware,[5][6] the younger daughter of Joseph and Margaret Jamison.[5] She has two older brothers and an older sister.[5] Kullman attended Tower Hill School in Wilmington and then studied mechanical engineering at Tufts University, where she received her bachelor's degree in 1978.[5] In 1983, she received a master's degree in management from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[5]
Career[edit]




Kullman at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 30, 2009


Kullman began her business career at General Electric and joined DuPont in 1988 as marketing manager in the company's medical imaging business.[5][6] In her later role as executive vice president she was responsible for four of DuPont's business platforms as well as leading the company's growth in markets outside the USA.[5]
DuPont's board of directors elected Kullman President and a director of the company with effect from October 1, 2008 and Chief Executive Officer with effect from January 1, 2009.[7] She is the nineteenth executive, and the first woman, to lead the company in its 212-year history.[8] Fortune magazine named Kullman fifteenth in its list of the world's fifty most powerful women for 2008,[9] and fifth on the list for 2009[10] and 2010.[11] In 2014 she was ranked as the 31st most powerful woman in the world, up from 42nd in 2013.[3] The Wall Street Journal named her eighth on its 2008 list of "Women to Watch".[12]
Kullman was a director of General Motors from 2004-2008[13][14] and was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University in 2006.[15]
On October 30, 2009, DuPont announced that its board of directors had elected Kullman as Chair of the company effective December 31, 2009.[16][17]
She is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 - 2013.[18]
On June 6, 2013 the US-China Business Council announced that Kullman had been elected as its Chair.[19]
Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Kullman was a director of General Motors from 2004-2008[13][14] and was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University in 2006.[15]
On October 30, 2009, DuPont announced that its board of directors had elected Kullman as Chair of the company effective December 31, 2009.[16][17]
She is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 - 2013.[18]
On June 6, 2013 the US-China Business Council announced that Kullman had been elected as its Chair.[19]
Kullman's retirement was announced by DuPont on October 5, 2015 (effective October 16, 2015) following a battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Trian Fund Management, his investment firm. Peltz sought 4 board seats and argued that DuPont needed to cut costs and meet financial targets, but had lost a shareholder vote earlier in the year.[4]
On December 21, 2016, Kullman joined the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as an independent director.[20]

Mereka adalah sosok Kartini di zaman digital. Sosok perempuan besi di era teknologi. Tanpa mereka, mungkin kita tak bisa hidup nyaman dan nyenyak dengan teknologi.
PeekYou, sebuah situs yang memberikan layanan ‘pencarian orang’ di internet berdasarkan pengaruh mereka, menempatkan sembilan nama wanita-wanita dibawah ini.
Meg Whitman, Presiden dan CEO Hewlett Packard (HP)

Sejak menjadi Presiden dan CEO HP, Meg Whitman membuat sejumlah langkah-langkah besar dan berani. Salah satunya adalah dengan menggabungkan perusahaan divisi PC dengan divisi printing.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
