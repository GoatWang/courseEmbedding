The rapid evolution of today’s contact centers from a back office cost burden to a profit-generating, front-line point of contact between the company and its customers has dramatically changed the way these mission-critical organizations are measured, managed and rewarded. As a contact center manager or line-of-business executive, you know that senior management, shareholders, your demanding customers, regulatory mandates and growing business pressures require you to find better ways to:

Improve the customer experience
Find and remove real obstacles to individual effort and work group performance faster
Identify and reward top performing employees
Reduce costs
Automate manual processes and streamline call flow
Comply with new legislation and regulatory mandates

Contact Centers are using Cicero products to deliver:

Process Analytics —   Track personal and workflow productivity across multiple users and desktops
Operational Insight — Gather empirical, objective data about how your people, processes and technology help or hurt service delivery
Business Process Automation— Identify and prioritize work process issues that need to be addressed; streamline process execution by sharing data between applications
Sign-On Enablement — manage user logins by providing a central location to modify credentials; monitor and take action when users need to be automatically logged back into an application or when an application needs to be restarted without interrupting the user
Business Adherence and Compliance —monitor and then enforce business requirements and compliance in workflows by forcing agents to complete the necessary procedures during customer interactions
Call Wrap-Up —record the actions the users took during a call or other interaction and include these in the call history or call wrap-up notes

Product Details
Cicero Discovery is a lightweight and configurable tool to collect activity and application performance data and track business objects across time and across multiple users as well as measure against a defined “expected” business process flow, either for analysis or to feed a third party application. Cicero Discovery helps customers identify what is actually happening to an object through its life cycle and identify optimal business process and/or critical steps that are missing or holding up the process.
Cicero Discovery software enables you to gather Desktop Activity Intelligence (DAI) by capturing, storing, and reporting activities and events across applications to identify technical, process and resource bottlenecks that effect user productivity.  Collecting this data helps organizations focus on areas for improvement in processes, compliance, training, and application performance.
Cicero Discovery allows you to:

Identify inconsistent workflow or missing steps
Monitor for PCI and HIPAA compliance
Pinpoint repetitive and manual tasks
Capture where copying happens and how often
Identify if employees are navigating several screens
Capture, analyze, and focus on KPIs and metrics
Monitor business rules and policies
Supply desktop data BI, BAM, BPM, WFM, etc.
Improve usage and better leverage IT investments

Cicero Discovery is client-server software consisting of six primary desktop sensors: Session, System, Activity, Business Data, Business Process, and Outlook. These sensors are used to capture various data and using a centralized management tool can be configured to meet your specific requirements.For more information, click here.
The product is available for worldwide use through Cicero.
