The Boston Family Office was founded in 1996 by professionals responsible for the financial affairs of their families as well as other individuals and trusts.  After decades of experience, they felt that they could achieve better results and service in a smaller, independent firm.	

The Boston Family Office now manages over $1 billion in assets, spread over more than 175 individuals and families, each individually managed by a principal of the firm.

Investment Management Services
Each client relationship is individually managed at The Boston Family Office.  The initial step in a relationship is to work one-on-one with clients to understand their long-term goals, income requirements, tolerance for risk, tax constraints, and other relevant factors.  Once the plan is implemented, we communicate regularly to make sure that any changes in circumstance are incorporated in the plan.  In addition, each account is reviewed semi-annually by our Investment Committee, or more frequently as required, to ensure that the other members of our firm are familiar with all our clients and that we are adhering to the investment guidelines. 


Custody
Custody services for your assets are available through the BNY Mellon at no additional charge.  Mellon provides statements as well as trust accounting and comprehensive tax reporting.


Trust and Estates
Our group has a wealth of experience in this area.  While The Boston Family Office cannot act as a corporate trustee, all of our principals serve as trustee in situations ranging from multigenerational trusts to generation skipping trusts to charitable trusts, and as executors in certain circumstances.  We also have working relationships with many attorneys who specialize in this field and can provide referrals to professionals with the skills and insight to best handle a client's particular situation.


Trusted Advisor Service
You may want periodic, or one-time investment advice from The Boston Family Office without engaging us in an ongoing management relationship.  In addition, there are a number of situations where a financial intermediary might be helpful.  A corporate trustee (a bank trust department or other financial institution) may be more responsive if it is aware that a knowledgeable third party is monitoring its actions.  In these and other cases, we can act as the liaison between the beneficiary and the trustee including:


Where a bank trust department or other financial institution is "locked in" as trustee;
Where a trustee or beneficiary has limited financial knowledge; 
Where a trustee and/or beneficiary has little input in investment decisions.

The Boston Family Office | History






















































































































The Boston Family Office was founded by professionals who had actively managed the financial affairs of their families, as well as those of other individuals and trusts, for decades. Over that time, they had piloted people through bear, bull and laggard markets, through inflation, and through recessions and recoveries. They were concerned about the ever increasing consolidation in the financial industry and wanted to create a firm where the client would remain the primary focus. With that principal in mind, the core group of David Richardson, Jr. George Putnam, III, Ned Weld, Dick Macklem, George Beal and Solange Bell opened the office in the fall of 1996.    


The goals of the founders were to develop a comprehensive financial plan for each client, to manage the assets with the same care and insight as they managed their own affairs, and to manage the assets both for this generation and for the generations to come. We still value these goals to this day. While our assets have grown from $100 million when we opened the door in 1996 to over $1 billion today, we remain committed to maintaining our independence and providing our clients with individualized portfolio management.

The Boston Family Office | About Us






















































































































Our Guiding Principles


To manage our clients' assets as if they were our own.
To provide continuity of service across generations.
To accomplish both at a reasonable cost.



At The Boston Family Office, we develop a comprehensive plan for each client based on their existing assets, immediate needs and long-term goals.  On an ongoing basis, we monitor and communicate investment results and adjust the portfolio or strategy as needed. 


Strengths

Individual account management
Each client's account is individually managed and is continually overseen by a principal of The Boston Family Office.  In addition, our Investment Committee reviews each account semi-annually noting instances of high cash levels, concentrations in individual securities and excessive weightings in market sectors.


Objectivity and independence
We are a privately held partnership, which allows us to maintain a truly long-term approach and focus exclusively on serving your financial needs.


Tax sensitivity
Managing assets of individuals and families requires a particular sensitivity to taxes, given those investments are often called on to support multiple generations and can involve low-cost positions.  With each client, we determine an acceptable level of capital gains to be harvested and manage each account with these longer-term tax consequences in mind.


Multigenerational client experience
As our name implies, we are well versed in the complexities of managing assets across multiple generations, with their diverse and conflicting objectives.
