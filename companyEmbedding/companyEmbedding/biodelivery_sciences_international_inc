Onsolis® (fentanyl buccal soluble film)




 

 
ONSOLIS® utilizes the BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA®) drug delivery technology, which consists of a small, bioerodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (inner lining of the cheek). 
 
ONSOLIS® is licensed in the U.S. to Collegium Pharmaceutical. Outside the U.S., ONSOLIS is licensed to Meda, with the exception of Taiwan, where it is licensed to TTY Biopharm. 
 
ONSOLIS® is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ONSOLIS® may be dispensed only to patients enrolled in the TIRF REMS Access program.
 



WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL
 
RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION
Fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with immediate-release transmucosal fentanyl, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing. The substitution of ONSOLIS for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose.

Due to the risk of respiratory depression, ONSOLIS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients. [see Contraindications]

ONSOLIS must be kept out of reach of children. [See Patient Counseling Information (17.1) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling(16.1)]
 
The concomitant use of ONSOLIS with CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Drug Interactions (7)].
 
MEDICATION ERRORS
Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of ONSOLIS compared to other fentanyl products that result in clinically important differences in the extent of absorption of fentanyl that could result in fatal overdose.- When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other fentanyl products to ONSOLIS. (2.1)- When dispensing, do not substitute an ONSOLIS prescription for other fentanyl products.
 
ABUSE POTENTIAL
ONSOLIS contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance, with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. ONSOLIS can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing ONSOLIS in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion.
 
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, ONSOLIS is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
 
Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.




 
 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 
ONSOLIS® is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
 
Limitations of Use: ONSOLIS® may be dispensed only to patients enrolled in the TIRF REMS Access Program.
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS


Opioid non-tolerant patients.
Acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraine, dental pain, or use in the emergency room.
Intolerance or hypersensitivity to fentanyl or components of ONSOLIS®.

 
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 

Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly.
ONSOLIS® films contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal.
Use with other CNS depressants or CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted.
ONSOLIS® may impair ability for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery).
Titrate ONSOLIS® cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. 


ADVERSE REACTIONS
 
Most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥10%): nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dehydration, dyspnea, and somnolence.
 
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BioDelivery Sciences at 1-800-469-0261, option 2 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch

BUNAVAIL®(buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film (CIII)




About Opioid Dependence:
Opioid dependence is a significantly undertreated condition in the U.S., with approximately 2.5 million people dependent on prescription opioids according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Overdose Deaths Involving Opioids, United States (2002-2015)
 

Source:  CDC
 

 


Source:  CDC
 
Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that is characterized by the inability of an individual to stop using opioids, both prescription opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and oxycodone, as well as illicit opioids such as heroin, even when it is in the best interest of the individual to do so. Opioid dependence is a complex medical condition that often requires long-term treatment and care. The treatment of opioid dependence is important to reduce both the associated health and social consequences and to improve the well-being and social functioning of people affected.
 
About BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and nalaxone buccal film)
 
BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone buccal film) is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.  Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction and Treatment Act (DATA).
BUNAVAIL is the first and only formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone for buccal (inside of the cheek) administration. BUNAVAIL was designed using BDSI's advanced drug delivery technology, BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA®), allowing for the efficient and convenient delivery of buprenorphine while potentially overcoming some of the administration challenges presented by the sublingual (under the tongue) dosage forms currently available. BUNAVAIL has twice the bioavailability (drug absorbed into the body) of buprenorphine compared to Suboxone, the market leader in this category. As a result of the improved absorption of buprenorphine with BUNAVAIL, which is the direct result of the BEMA technology, plasma concentrations of buprenorphine comparable to Suboxone can be achieved with half the dose, which may help to reduce the potential for misuse and diversion and potentially lessen the incidence of certain side effects.

INDICATION
 
BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Buccal Film (CIII) is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.
 
Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA).
 
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Keep BUNAVAIL (buprenorphine and naloxone) Buccal Film (CIII) out of the sight and reach of children.  Ingestion of BUNAVAIL by a child may cause severe breathing problems and death.  If a child takes BUNAVAIL, get emergency help right away.
 
Do not take BUNAVAIL if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone, as serious negative effects including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.
 
Do not take BUNAVAIL before the effects of other opioids (e.g., heroin, methadone, oxycodone, morphine) have lessened as you may experience withdrawal symptoms.
 
BUNAVAIL is not appropriate as an analgesic.  There have been reported deaths of opioid naïve individuals who received a buprenorphine dose smaller than the lowest available BUNAVAIL strength.
 
Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or perform any other dangerous activities until you know how BUNAVAIL affects you.
 
BUNAVAIL contains buprenorphine, an opioid that can cause physical dependence.  Your doctor can tell you more about the difference between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not stop taking BUNAVAIL without talking to your doctor. You could become sick with uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms because your body has become used to this medicine.
 
Do not switch from BUNAVAIL to other medicines that contain buprenorphine without talking with your doctor. The amount of buprenorphine in a dose of BUNAVAIL is not the same as the amount of buprenorphine in other medicines.  Your doctor will prescribe a dose of BUNAVAIL that may be different than other buprenorphine-containing medicines you may have been taking.
 
BUNAVAIL can cause serious life-threatening breathing problems, overdose and death, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines, sedatives, tranquilizers or alcohol.   You should not drink alcohol while taking BUNAVAIL, as this can lead to loss of consciousness or even death.
 
Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, BUNAVAIL buccal film, or both in situations of concomitant prescription.
 
Like other opioids (e.g., heroin, methadone, oxycodone, morphine), BUNAVAIL may produce orthostatic hypotension (‘dizzy spells’) in ambulatory individuals.
 
Common side effects of BUNAVAIL include headache, drug withdrawal syndrome, lethargy (lack of energy), sweating, constipation, decrease in sleep (insomnia), fatigue and sleepiness.
 
Cases of adrenal insufficiency, a potentially-life threatening condition, have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of treatment.
 
Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events.
 
Because BUNAVAIL contains naloxone, injecting BUNAVAIL may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, sleep problems, and cravings.
 
BUNAVAIL can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit.  Keep BUNAVAIL in a safe place. Do not give your BUNAVAIL to other people, it can cause them harm or even death. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.
 
BUNAVAIL is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  BUNAVAIL may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
 
Before taking BUNAVAIL, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking BUNAVAIL, tell your doctor immediately as there may be significant risks to you and your baby; your baby may have symptoms of withdrawal at birth.
 
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit.
 
Before taking BUNAVAIL, talk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed your baby. BUNAVAIL can pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby.  Monitor your baby for increased sleepiness and breathing problems.  Your doctor should tell you about the best way to feed your baby if you are taking BUNAVAIL.
 
This is not a complete list of potential adverse events associated with BUNAVAIL Buccal Film. Please see full Prescribing Information for a complete list.
 
To report negative side effects associated with taking BUNAVAIL Buccal Film, please call 1-
800-469-0261.  You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.
 
For more information, please see full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for BUNAVAIL® Buccal Film (CIII).

BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ:BDSI) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 
On July12, 2017, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (“BDSI”), its wholly-owned subsidiary Arius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively with BDSI, the “Company”), and Purdue Pharma, an Ontario limited partnership (“Purdue”), entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which the Company granted to Purdue the exclusive rights to commercialize BELBUCA® (buprenorphine hydrochloride buccal film) in Canada. BELBUCA is BDSIs approved treatment for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, continuous, long-term treatment and that is opioid-responsive and for which alternative options are inadequate. 
Also on July12, 2017, the Company and Purdue also entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) under which the Company agreed to supply (directly or indirectly through third party contractors) to Purdue, and Purdue agreed to acquire exclusively from the Company, all of Purdues needs of BELBUCA in connection with Purdues activities under the License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. 
Under the terms of the License Agreement, Purdue is responsible for the distribution, marketing and sale of BELBUCA in Canada. In connection therewith, the Company and Purdue each have agreed to use their best efforts to cause a transfer to Purdue of the current marketing authorization in Canada for BELBUCA, including the previously issued Notice of Compliance for BELBUCA in Canada and BELBUCAs Canadian drug identification numbers. 
Financial terms of the License Agreement include: (i)total upfront and other cash milestone payments (relating to marketing authorization transfer and certain other marketing- and sales-related milestones) of up to an aggregate of CAD$4.5million, including approximately CAD$1.5million which is expected to be paid to the Company during 2017; (i) a low double digit percent royalty payable quarterly by Purdue to the Company based on Canadian net sales of BELBUCA, which royalty rate is subject to adjustment in certain negotiated circumstances; (iii)an annual royalty fee commencing a period of time after the commercial launch of BELBUCA in Canada, which fee is creditable against royalties payable by Purdue and subject to reduction in certain negotiated circumstances; and (iv)reimbursement by Purdue of certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company for obtaining and transferring to Purdue the marketing authorization for BELBUCA in Canada, a portion of which will be credited against royalties payable by Purdue. 
The License Agreement grants to Purdue certain rights of first negotiation and rights of first refusal for Canadian rights to certain buprenorphine-based products that the Company may seek to out license or itself develop or commercialize in the future, and the parties have agreed to certain restrictions on their ability to commercialize certain competing products in Canada. The License Agreement also contains customary confidentiality, indemnification and other provisions. 
The License Agreement continues until the later of (a)the first date on which there is not a valid claim of the licensed patents covering BELBUCA in Canada as set forth in the License Agreement or (b)a negotiated date in the calendar year immediately following the first complete calendar year following the a particular anniversary of the Launch in which a predetermined amount of net sales of BELBUCA in Canada is not met. The License Agreement contains certain negotiated as well as customary early termination provisions including, among others, termination rights related to unexpected regulatory costs, a right by either party to terminate the License Agreement upon the other partys uncured material breach of the License Agreement or Supply Agreement, insolvency, or bankruptcy, and a right by the Company to terminate in the event first commercial sale in Canada does not occur within a certain period of marketing authorization transfer or license fees are not paid. Purdue may also terminate the License Agreement if Purdue determines, in its sole discretion, that BELBUCA is not economically viable for Purdue in Canada or in the event BDSI is acquired by a company commercializing certain limited types of competing products in Canada. 
The description of the License Agreement and Supply Agreement above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full agreements, which will be filed as exhibits to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September30, 2017. 
Item 1.01.
Other Information. 
On July12, 2017, BDSI and Purdue issued a press release announcing the execution of the License Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ:BDSI) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 
On July12, 2017, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (“BDSI”), its wholly-owned subsidiary Arius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively with BDSI, the “Company”), and Purdue Pharma, an Ontario limited partnership (“Purdue”), entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which the Company granted to Purdue the exclusive rights to commercialize BELBUCA® (buprenorphine hydrochloride buccal film) in Canada. BELBUCA is BDSIs approved treatment for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, continuous, long-term treatment and that is opioid-responsive and for which alternative options are inadequate. 
Also on July12, 2017, the Company and Purdue also entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) under which the Company agreed to supply (directly or indirectly through third party contractors) to Purdue, and Purdue agreed to acquire exclusively from the Company, all of Purdues needs of BELBUCA in connection with Purdues activities under the License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. 
Under the terms of the License Agreement, Purdue is responsible for the distribution, marketing and sale of BELBUCA in Canada. In connection therewith, the Company and Purdue each have agreed to use their best efforts to cause a transfer to Purdue of the current marketing authorization in Canada for BELBUCA, including the previously issued Notice of Compliance for BELBUCA in Canada and BELBUCAs Canadian drug identification numbers. 
Financial terms of the License Agreement include: (i)total upfront and other cash milestone payments (relating to marketing authorization transfer and certain other marketing- and sales-related milestones) of up to an aggregate of CAD$4.5million, including approximately CAD$1.5million which is expected to be paid to the Company during 2017; (i) a low double digit percent royalty payable quarterly by Purdue to the Company based on Canadian net sales of BELBUCA, which royalty rate is subject to adjustment in certain negotiated circumstances; (iii)an annual royalty fee commencing a period of time after the commercial launch of BELBUCA in Canada, which fee is creditable against royalties payable by Purdue and subject to reduction in certain negotiated circumstances; and (iv)reimbursement by Purdue of certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company for obtaining and transferring to Purdue the marketing authorization for BELBUCA in Canada, a portion of which will be credited against royalties payable by Purdue. 
The License Agreement grants to Purdue certain rights of first negotiation and rights of first refusal for Canadian rights to certain buprenorphine-based products that the Company may seek to out license or itself develop or commercialize in the future, and the parties have agreed to certain restrictions on their ability to commercialize certain competing products in Canada. The License Agreement also contains customary confidentiality, indemnification and other provisions. 
The License Agreement continues until the later of (a)the first date on which there is not a valid claim of the licensed patents covering BELBUCA in Canada as set forth in the License Agreement or (b)a negotiated date in the calendar year immediately following the first complete calendar year following the a particular anniversary of the Launch in which a predetermined amount of net sales of BELBUCA in Canada is not met. The License Agreement contains certain negotiated as well as customary early termination provisions including, among others, termination rights related to unexpected regulatory costs, a right by either party to terminate the License Agreement upon the other partys uncured material breach of the License Agreement or Supply Agreement, insolvency, or bankruptcy, and a right by the Company to terminate in the event first commercial sale in Canada does not occur within a certain period of marketing authorization transfer or license fees are not paid. Purdue may also terminate the License Agreement if Purdue determines, in its sole discretion, that BELBUCA is not economically viable for Purdue in Canada or in the event BDSI is acquired by a company commercializing certain limited types of competing products in Canada. 
The description of the License Agreement and Supply Agreement above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full agreements, which will be filed as exhibits to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September30, 2017. 
Item 1.01.
Other Information. 
On July12, 2017, BDSI and Purdue issued a press release announcing the execution of the License Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. 
Item 1.01.

RALEIGH, N.C. and PICKERING, Ontario, July 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ: BDSI), a specialty pharmaceutical company with a focus in pain management and addiction medicine, and Purdue Pharma (Canada) announce that they have signed an exclusive agreement for the licensing, distribution, marketing and sale of BELBUCA® (buprenorphine buccal film) in Canada. 
BELBUCA® was recently approved by Health Canada for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, continuous, long-term treatment and that is opioid-responsive and for which alternative options are inadequate. BELBUCA® incorporates BDSI's BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA®) drug delivery technology and is the first and only long-acting opioid that uses novel buccal film technology to deliver buprenorphine for appropriate patients living with chronic pain.
According to the Canadian Pain Society, pain is the most common reason for seeking healthcare, with 1 in 5 Canadian adults suffering from chronic pain.

Dr. Mark A. Sirgo, President and CEO, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. commented: "We look forward to our partnership with Purdue Pharma (Canada) and expanding the reach of BELBUCA® to patients in Canada who are suffering from chronic pain.  We are particularly enthusiastic to be partnering with a company like Purdue given their long history and commitment to pain management as well as their expertise and strong presence in the Canadian pain market. The licensing of BELBUCA® in Canada is a very important step for BioDelivery Sciences in broadening access to BELBUCA® beyond the U.S., and we look forward to the introduction of the product."
Dr. Craig Landau, President and CEO, Purdue Pharma (Canada) added: "BELBUCA® provides physicians another safe and effective treatment option, when used as indicated, for Canadian patients, deemed appropriate for treatment, who suffer from long-term, chronic pain. We believe the potential benefits of this buprenorphine-containing product are significant, and are enthusiastic at the opportunity to bring this therapeutic option to Canada. This agreement and the subsequent launch of Belbuca® underscores our commitment to pain patients and more broadly, to the field of pain management."  
In return for the licensing and distribution rights to BELBUCA® in Canada, BioDelivery Sciences is eligible to receive upfront and potential milestones of up to $4.5 million CAD as well as royalties on net sales.

BUNAVAIL (BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.): FDA Package Insert

 







DrugInserts.com
Prescription Medications



    


BUNAVAIL: Package Insert and Label InformationBy BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. | Last revised: 6 January 2017
BUNAVAIL- buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate filmBioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGEBUNAVAIL buccal film is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.
 Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1         Important Dosage and Administration Information 



BUNAVAIL buccal film is applied to the buccal mucosa as a single daily dose. BUNAVAIL buccal film should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using buprenorphine sublingual tablets.
The difference in bioavailability of BUNAVAIL compared to SUBOXONE sublingual tablet requires a different dosage strength to be administered to the patient. A BUNAVAIL 4.2/0.7 mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a SUBOXONE 8/2 mg sublingual tablet.
Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.
2.2         Maintenance  BUNAVAIL buccal film is indicated for maintenance treatment. The recommended target dosage of BUNAVAIL buccal film is 8.4/1.4 mg per day as a single daily dose. The dosage of BUNAVAIL buccal film should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2.1/0.3 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. The maintenance dose of BUNAVAIL buccal film is generally in the range of 2.1/0.3 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 12.6/2.1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. Dosages higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient’s level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.  2.3         Method of Administration The patient should:
 use the tongue to wet the inside of the cheek or rinse the mouth with water to moisten the area immediately before placement of BUNAVAIL; open the BUNAVAIL package immediately prior to use as indicated by the instructions; hold the BUNAVAIL film with clean, dry fingers with the text (BN2, BN4, or BN6) facing up; place the side of the BUNAVAIL film with the text (BN2, BN4, or BN6) against the inside of the cheek; press and hold the film in place for 5 seconds.  BUNAVAIL film(s) adheres to the moist buccal mucosa and should stay in place after this period.
If multiple films need to be administered, the patient should immediately apply the next film according to the steps above. Note that when two films are required for one dose, the patient should place one film on the inside of one cheek and the other film on the inside of the other cheek. For doses requiring multiple films, no more than two films should be applied to the inside of one cheek at a time.
BUNAVAIL film(s) completely dissolves after application. The patient should be instructed to avoid manipulating the film(s) with the tongue or finger(s) and avoid drinking or eating food until the film(s) dissolves. BUNAVAIL film should not be chewed or swallowed as this may result in lower peak concentrations and lower bioavailability [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Instruct the patient to use the entire film. BUNAVAIL should not be cut or torn.
Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.
2.4         Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient’s clinical stability permits. BUNAVAIL buccal film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient’s level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.
Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.
Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physician’s evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:
 Absence of medication toxicity Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects Responsible handling of medications by the patient Patient’s compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities) Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use)  If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.
2.5         Patients With Hepatic Impairment Severe hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, and moderate hepatic impairment also results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a greater extent than buprenorphine. Because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated, the combination product should generally be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].
2.6         Unstable Patients Physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.
2.7         Stopping Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with BUNAVAIL buccal film after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Taper patients to avoid opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.
2.8         Switching between BUNAVAILbuccal Film and Other Buprenorphine/Naloxone Combination Products For patients being switched between ZUBSOLV sublingual tablets and other buprenorphine/naloxone products dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients should be monitored for over-medication as well as withdrawal or other signs of under-dosing.
The difference in bioavailability of BUNAVAIL compared to SUBOXONE sublingual tablet requires a different dosage strength to be administered to the patient. A BUNAVAIL 4.2/0.7 mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a SUBOXONE 8/2 mg sublingual tablet.
Patients being switched between SUBOXONE dosage strengths and BUNAVAIL dosage strengths should be started on the corresponding dosage as defined below:
     Suboxone Sublingual Tablet Dosage Strength Corresponding BUNAVAIL Buccal Film Strength     4/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone 2.1/0.3 mg buprenorphine/naloxone   8/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone 4.2/0.7 mg buprenorphine/naloxone   12/3 mg buprenorphine/naloxone 6.3/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone   3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHSBUNAVAIL buccal film is supplied as a yellow rectangular buccal film in three dosage strengths:
 buprenorphine/naloxone 2.1 mg / 0.3 mg buprenorphine/naloxone 4.2 mg / 0.7 mg buprenorphine/naloxone 6.3 mg / 1 mg  4 CONTRAINDICATIONSBUNAVAIL buccal film should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1         Abuse Potential Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient’s level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].
5.2         Respiratory Depression Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self-injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with BUNAVAIL buccal film [see  Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. 
I n the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary.
BUNAVAIL buccal film should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).
5.3         CNS Depression Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, BUNAVAIL buccal film, or both in situations of concomitant prescribing [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ].
5.4         Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ].
5.5              Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  ​ Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see  Specific Populations  (8.1) ]. 
Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with BUNAVAIL of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.
5.6         Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.
5.7 Dependence  ​ Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 
5.8         Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, BUNAVAIL buccal film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.
5.9         Allergic Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of BUNAVAIL buccal film.
5.910     Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, BUNAVAIL buccal film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, BUNAVAIL buccal film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered bucally before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
