    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Honorable Arthur J. Gajarsa Joins Supreme Board






Business Wire




Jul 5, 2012 4:20 PM EDT













 


















































  Supreme’s Chairman of the Board Herbert M. Gardner stated: “We are pleased to announce the addition of Judge Gajarsa to our Board. His service in the judiciary, government, and in private practice representing business clients will permit him to bring a very broad scope of relevant experience to the Board.”   To be added to Supreme Industries’ email distribution list, please click on the link below: http://www.clearperspectivegroup.com/clearsite/sts/emailoptin.html.  About Supreme Industries  Supreme Industries, Inc. (NYSE Amex: STS), is a nationwide manufacturer of specialized truck bodies produced to the specifications of its customers. Supreme also manufactures special-purpose “shuttle-type” buses and armored vehicles. The Company's transportation equipment products are used by a wide variety of industrial, commercial and law enforcement customers. News releases and other information on the Company are available on the Internet at: http://www.supremeind.com or http://www.b2i.us/irpass.asp?BzID=1482&to=ea&s=0  Other than historical facts contained, the matters set forth in this news release are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, and reflect the view of management with respect to future events. When used in this report, words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions, as they relate to Supreme or its plans or operations, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions made by, and information currently available to management. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, and it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations include, without limitation, an economic slowdown in the specialized vehicle industry, limitations on the availability of chassis on which Supreme's product is dependent, availability of raw materials, raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases. Furthermore, Supreme can provide no assurance that any raw material cost increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of price increases for Supreme's products. The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect the current view of management with respect to future events and are subject to those factors and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to the operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Supreme.

GOSHEN, Ind. -- Supreme Industries, Inc. (NYSE MKT: STS), a leading
manufacturer of specialized commercial vehicles, including truck bodies,
shuttle buses and armored vehicles, today announced that Honorable
Arthur J. Gajarsa has been elected to its Board of Directors.
Judge Gajarsa gained extensive experience in the field of law during
his nearly fifty year career through both government service and
representation of clients in private practice. He recently retired after
serving as a judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, a position to which he was nominated in 1996 and to which he
was confirmed by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1997. Prior to
his appointment, he was Senior Partner with the firm of Joseph, Gajarsa,
McDermott & Reiner, P.C., where his practice included the areas of
corporate mergers and acquisitions, international, commercial
litigation, trade, intellectual property, and representation of American
Native tribes. Judge Gajarsa also previously served as Special Counsel
to the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian affairs,
among other government experience.
Since 1994, Judge Gajarsa has been a member of the Board of
Directors of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and since 2011 has served
as Chairman of the Board; from 1998 through 2010 he served as Vice
Chairman. From 1996 through 2008, Judge Gajarsa was a member of the
Board of Directors for Georgetown University and from 2002 to 2008, he
served as Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Law Committee, and the
Executive Committee.
Judge Gajarsa received his B.S.E.E. from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, his M.A. from Catholic University of America, and his J.D.
from Georgetown University Law Center.
Judge Gajarsa will serve on the Company's Compensation
Committee. He will be entitled to receive the same compensation for
service as is provided to the Company's other non-employee
directors. There are no family relationships between Judge Gajarsa and
any other executive officers or directors of the Company.
Supreme's Chairman of the Board Herbert M. Gardner stated:
"We are pleased to announce the addition of Judge Gajarsa to our
Board. His service in the judiciary, government, and in private practice
representing business clients will permit him to bring a very broad
scope of relevant experience to the Board."

Profile
Experience

 


Robert Gajarsa is an associate in the Washington, D.C. office of Latham & Watkins and is a member of the Supreme Court & Appellate and Intellectual Property Litigation Practices.
Mr. Gajarsa’s practice is focused on complex intellectual property issues at both the appellate and trial levels, where he has represented many Fortune 500 companies in high-stakes litigation.

Mr. Gajarsa is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, where, in collaboration with Chief Judge Sharon Prost and the Hon. Arthur Gajarsa, he teaches a writing and experiential seminar, Patent Appeals at the Federal Circuit, which covers all procedural and substantive aspects of successful appeals to the Federal Circuit.

Prior to joining Latham, Mr. Gajarsa worked for the appellate and intellectual property practices of two global litigation firms. He also completed appellate clerkships for:


Chief Judge Sharon Prost of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    
Judge Raymond Chen of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    
Judge Kent Jordan of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (who sat by designation in the District of Delaware on two patent cases during Mr. Gajarsa’s clerkship)
    

At those courts, Mr. Gajarsa assisted in the disposition of a wide range of intellectual property matters, including patent, trademark, and Lanham Act disputes.

Mr. Gajarsa has also assisted clients with issues reaching beyond intellectual property, including antitrust matters, cross-border disputes, and questions of constitutional law. In addition, prior to practicing law, Mr. Gajarsa advised businesses on institutional and organizational change.



Mr. Gajarsa has significant experience in all stages of litigation. At the trial level, he has shepherded cases from complaint to decision, led international discovery teams, argued successfully at several hearings, and drafted numerous Markman briefs, dispositive pretrial motions, and post-trial requests for relief.

At the appellate level, Mr. Gajarsa has assisted clients with over 40 matters and has authored dozens of briefs and motions. Mr. Gajarsa has been lead counsel in four appeals before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, including two in which the Court requested appointment of counsel, and he has argued twice before the Court last year alone.

Mr. Gajarsa’s representative experience includes:


Intellectual Ventures v. Symantec Corp. Defended Symantec during jury trial in multi-patent case concerning antivirus and anti-spam technology. Represented Symantec in multiple Federal Circuit appeals and successfully invalidated all claims of asserted patents under § 101, including reversal of district court opinion upholding claim of one antivirus patent as patent eligible.
