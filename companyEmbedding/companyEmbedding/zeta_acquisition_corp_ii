	Compliance
	with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act




	   




	                 Section 16(a)
	of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and officers, and persons
	who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company’s equity
	securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
	ownership of the Company’s securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5.
	Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC
	regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
	they file.



	 





	Based solely on the Company’s review of
	the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2008 and written representations that no other reports were
	required, the Company believes that no person who, at any time during such
	fiscal year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than 10% of the
	Company’s common stock failed to comply with all Section 16(a) filing
	requirements during such fiscal years.



	 



	Code
	of Ethics



	 



	We have
	not adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal
	executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
	controller, or persons performing similar functions in that our officers and
	directors serve in these capacities.







	Nominating
	Committee









	We have not adopted any procedures by
	which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of
	Directors.







	Audit
	Committee

	ZETA ACQUISITION CORP. I




	(A Development Stage Company)









	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements




	(Unaudited)




	June 30, 2013











	1.  






	Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies











	Nature of Operations







	Zeta Acquisition Corp. I (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007.  The Company is a new enterprise in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 915,

	Development Stage Entities

	.  The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  The Company's principal business objective for the next twelve (12) months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business.  The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.







	Liquidity







	Since its inception, the Company has generated no revenues and has incurred a net loss of $160,686.  Since inception, the Company has been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its continuing activities.  The Company has not identified any business combination and therefore, cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for any particular transaction.  In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources.  The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the basis of the continuation of the Company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.







	Use of Estimates







	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents







	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three (3) months or less to be cash equivalents.

	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (continued)




	(Unaudited)











	1.  






	Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)











	Income Taxes







	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,

	Income Taxes

	, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.







	Fair Value of Financial Instruments







	Pursuant to ASC Topic 820-10,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2013.  The Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses, and notes payable to stockholders to approximate fair value due to their short maturity.







	Net Loss Per Share







	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  The Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and diluted loss per share are the same for all periods presented.







	Interim Financial Statements







	The unaudited interim financial information included in this report reflects normal recurring adjustments that management believes are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods presented.  This interim information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the Company′s Form 10-K filed March 28, 2013.







	The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other interim periods or the full year.







	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements







	Management does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

	Notes Payable, Stockholders











	During 2013, various stockholders loaned the Company $25,000 and were issued unsecured promissory notes which bear interest at 6% and are due on demand.  Similar stockholder loans amounted to $25,000 during 2012, $35,000 during 2010, and $25,000 during 2009.  Interest of $13,912 was accrued and unpaid at June 30, 2013.







	During 2007, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to a stockholder and officer of the Company in the amount of $10,000.  The note was non-interest bearing and was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of common stock.











	3.  






	Preferred Stock











	The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.











	4.  






	Common Stock











	The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  During December 2007, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a private placement for $50,000.

	Forward Looking Statement Notice







	Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Zeta Acquisition Corp. I (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.







	Description of Business







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007 (Inception) and maintains its principal executive office at 666 Walnut Street, Suite 2116, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 1, 2008, and since its effectiveness, the Company has focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination.







	The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank check” company. The SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a “shell company,” defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.









	In addition, the Company is an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.





	 




	The Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.




	 






	 






	7










	 





	 




	We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of 

	the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company”, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.








	The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating business. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.



	 



	The Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:







	(i)       filing Exchange Act reports, and






	(ii)      investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.



	 



	We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, the Company has $16,151 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed.  

	Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target Company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such Company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.










	The Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.









	 






	8










	 






	 




	Since our Registration Statement on Form 10-SB went effective, our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.

	Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.




	 





	The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.







	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	As of June 30, 2013, the Company had current assets equal to $16,151, comprised exclusively of cash and cash equivalents.  This compares with current assets of $5,737

	,

	comprised of cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2012.

	 

	The Company’s current liabilities as of June 30, 2013 totaled $126,837, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes payable to stockholders.  This compares with liabilities of $103,712,

	 

	comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes payable to stockholders, as of December 31, 2012.

	 

	The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.









	The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and for the cumulative period from November 16, 2007 (Inception) to June 30, 2013:

	The Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.

	Results of Operations







	The Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been generated by the Company from November 16, 2007 (Inception) though June 30, 2013. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance.  It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. 







	For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $6,749 and $12,711, respectively, consisting of interest expense and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports.  This compares with a net loss of $6,314 and $11,662 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, consisting of interest expense, and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports.







	For the period from November 16, 2007 (Inception) to June 30, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $160,686 comprised exclusively of interest expense and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the formation of the Company, the filing of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form 10-SB in February of 2008, and the filing of the Company’s periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K.







	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements









	The Company does not have any

	off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Nature of
Operations and Significant Accounting Policies




 

Nature of
Operations

 

Zeta
Acquisition Corp. II (the "Company") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007.  The
Company is a new enterprise in the development stage as defined by
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 915, Development
Stage Entities .  The Company was organized as a
vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire
a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of
being a publicly held corporation.  The Company's
principal business objective for the next twelve (12) months and
beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a
combination with a business.  The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire
any type of business.

 

Liquidity

 

Since its
inception, the Company has generated no revenues and has incurred a
net loss of $72,902.  Since inception, the Company has
been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other
financing to fund its continuing activities.  The Company
has not identified any business combination and therefore, cannot
ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for
any particular transaction.  In addition, the Company is
dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding
and capital resources.  The accompanying financial
statements have been presented on the basis of the continuation of
the Company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three (3) months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Nature of
Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)




 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns.  A valuation
allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an
amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all
financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of March 31,
2010.  The Company considers the carrying value of cash
and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, and notes payable, stockholders to approximate
fair value due to their short maturity.

 

Net Loss
Per Share

 

Basic loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period.  The
Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and
diluted loss per share are the same for all periods
presented.

 

Interim
Financial Statements

 

The
unaudited interim financial information included in this report
reflects normal recurring adjustments that management believes are
necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows for the periods
presented.  This interim information should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes
contained in the Company′s Form 10-K filed March 31,
2010.

 

The
results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other
interim periods or the full year.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

Management
does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

Notes
Payable, Stockholders




 

During
2009, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes to various
stockholders of the Company.  The notes total $25,000,
bear interest at 6% and are due on demand.

 

During
2007, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to a
stockholder and officer of the Company in the amount of
$10,000.  The note was non-interest bearing and was
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of common stock.

 




3.



Preferred
Stock




 

The
Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as
may be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors.

 




4.



Common
Stock




 

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock
with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as
may be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors.  During December 2007, the Company issued
5,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a private
placement for $50,000.

 




5.



Income
Taxes




 

The
Company has approximately $10,935 in gross deferred tax assets at
March 31, 2010 resulting from capitalized start-up costs and net
operating losses.  A valuation allowance has been
recorded to fully offset these deferred tax assets as the future
realization of the related income tax benefit is uncertain.


 




6.



Commitment




 

The
Company utilizes the office space and equipment of an officer and
director at no cost on a month-to-month
basis.  Management estimates such amounts to be di
minimis.

Forward
Looking Statement Notice

 

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
“forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the
plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of Zeta Acquisition Corp. II (“we”, “us”,
“our” or the “Company”) to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The
forward-looking statements included herein are based on current
expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The
Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions
involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating
to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other
things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and
future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of
the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions
underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of
the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be
no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this
Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be
achieved.

 

Description
of Business

 

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16,
2007 and maintains its principal executive office at 666 Walnut
Street, Suite 2116, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. Since inception, the
Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining
initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a
business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an
operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on
Form 10-SB with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) on February 1, 2008, and since its
effectiveness, the Company has focused its efforts to identify a
possible business combination.

 

The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank
check” company. The SEC defines those companies as "any
development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the
meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific
business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan
is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Many states
have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of
securities of "blank check" companies in their respective
jurisdictions. The Company is also a “shell company,”
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no
or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.
Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a
market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until
we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company
intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange
