(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. 
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.

The figures above represent only estimated costs and may be adjusted based upon
the actual funds raised in the Offering and revenues.

If the Company is not successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares within the
prescribed 180 day period (which may be extended an additional 90 days in our
sole discretion), then we will not be able to proceed with our complete business
plan unless additional funds are raised in some other manner.

Our offering expenses of approximately $7,010 are comprised primarily of legal
and accounting expenses, publishing/Edgarization fees, SEC filing fees and
transfer agent fees. Our officer and director will not receive any compensation
for his effort in selling our shares.

If we are able to sell only 1,500,000, shares (75% of this Offering) we can
maintain our reporting requirements with the SEC and complete the development of
our business to distribute glass craft products, with the exception that we will
have insufficient funds to hire 3 salespeople. If we are not able to sell a
minimum of 500,000 shares (25% of this Offering), we will not implement our
business plan at all, except maintaining our reporting with the SEC and remain
in good standing with the state of Nevada. If we are unable to complete the full
Offering of 2,000,000 shares, we may attempt to raised the funds needed to
complete our Plan of Operation through equity financing, debt financing, or
other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website are
greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to
sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning additional
revenues.

We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following
this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing
when required. Our future is dependent upon the successful development of our
glass craft products business, a successful marketing and promotion program and
achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity
securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests
of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required
for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may
not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no
anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed
additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in
business.

If we are successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares of common stock under this
Offering, the net proceeds will be used for our business plan and general
working capital, during the twelve months following the successful completion of
this Offering. In all instances, after the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part, we will require some amount of
working capital to maintain our basic operations and comply with our public
reporting obligations. In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of
the amount of proceeds received, we may change the use of proceeds because of
changes in our business plan. Investors should understand that we have wide
discretion over the use of proceeds.


There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales
companies selling glass craft products, such as HOBBY LOBBY
(http://shop.hobbylobby.com/crafts-hobbies-and-fabric-crafts/glass-crafts/),
JO ANN STORE (http://www.joann.com/crafts/basics/craft-supplies/glass-art/), 
D&L ART GLASS SUPPLY (http://www.dlartglass.com/), and DELPHI GLASS 
(http://www.delphiglass.com/more-crafts/), to name a few of the larger 
competitors.

We expect to face medium to high level of resistance when we enter the market,
where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire
new customers. Substantially all of our competitors have greater financial
resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we
can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants.
We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new
competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Our competition varies by product line, customer classification and geographic
market. The principal competitive factors in our industry are quality of
product, pricing, service and delivery capabilities and availability of product.
We will compete with many local, regional and national glass craft products
distributors and dealers. In addition, some glass craft products suppliers might
sell and distribute their products directly to our customers, and the volume of
such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, distributors of
products similar to those distributed by us, such as distributors of Chinese
made glass craft products, may elect to sell and distribute to our customers in
the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other
distributors.

Glass craft products are distributed by many companies as well as numerous
stores and websites in the USA. To compete with other companies, we plan to use
helpful customer service and offer a wide assortment of glass craft products at
competitive prices. We will take significant efforts to promote our product
using marketing and internet tools.


Company Description
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014 to engage in
the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass
craft products produced in China.

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute glass craft
products, in forms


 including but not limited to glass crafts, novelties, knobs,
trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays, plates. We currently have some
operating history which includes revenues and cost of sales. Our plan of
operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our
Offering is to develop and establish our glass craft products distribution
business and hire three more salespeople.

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the
initial equity funding by our sole officer and director.  We have generated some
revenues and our principal business activities to date have consisted of
creating a business plan and entering into a Supply Agreement, dated July 10,
2014, with three Chinese companies, Xiamen Ebei Import & Export Co., Ltd.
(“Xiamen Ebei”), Yangzhou Kanglong Glass Arts Co., Ltd. (“Yangzhou Kanglong”),
and Yancheng Sunrise Import & Export Co.,Ltd. (“Yancheng Sunrise”).  Xiamen
Ebei, Yangzhou Kanglong and Yancheng Sunrise are large and well-established
suppliers and distributors of glass craft products in China.  The terms and
conditions of the Supply Agreement provide that, among other things, we have the
right to purchase a variety of glass craft products (including crafts,
novelties, knobs, trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays and plates)
produced by each of the companies.

Our executive offices are located at 8153 Finch Feather St., Las Vegas, NV 
89143. On July 28, 2014 we purchased an office and small shop for US$8,000, 
located at: Jaunciema gatve 40, Zieme?u rajons, R?ga, LV-1023, Latvia. Our 
phone number is (775) 572-8824.

(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. 
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.

The figures above represent only estimated costs and may be adjusted based upon
the actual funds raised in the Offering and revenues.

If the Company is not successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares within the
prescribed 180 day period (which may be extended an additional 90 days in our
sole discretion), then we will not be able to proceed with our complete business
plan unless additional funds are raised in some other manner.

Our offering expenses of approximately $7,010 are comprised primarily of legal
and accounting expenses, publishing/Edgarization fees, SEC filing fees and
transfer agent fees. Our officer and director will not receive any compensation
for his effort in selling our shares.

If we are able to sell only 1,500,000, shares (75% of this Offering) we can
maintain our reporting requirements with the SEC and complete the development of
our business to distribute glass craft products, with the exception that we will
have insufficient funds to hire 3 salespeople. If we are not able to sell a
minimum of 500,000 shares (25% of this Offering), we will not implement our
business plan at all, except maintaining our reporting with the SEC and remain
in good standing with the state of Nevada. If we are unable to complete the full
Offering of 2,000,000 shares, we may attempt to raised the funds needed to
complete our Plan of Operation through equity financing, debt financing, or
other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website are
greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to
sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning additional
revenues.

We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following
this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing
when required. Our future is dependent upon the successful development of our
glass craft products business, a successful marketing and promotion program and
achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity
securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests
of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required
for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may
not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no
anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed
additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in
business.

If we are successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares of common stock under this
Offering, the net proceeds will be used for our business plan and general
working capital, during the twelve months following the successful completion of
this Offering. In all instances, after the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part, we will require some amount of
working capital to maintain our basic operations and comply with our public
reporting obligations. In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of
the amount of proceeds received, we may change the use of proceeds because of
changes in our business plan. Investors should understand that we have wide
discretion over the use of proceeds.


There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales
companies selling glass craft products, such as HOBBY LOBBY
(http://shop.hobbylobby.com/crafts-hobbies-and-fabric-crafts/glass-crafts/),
JO ANN STORE (http://www.joann.com/crafts/basics/craft-supplies/glass-art/), 
D&L ART GLASS SUPPLY (http://www.dlartglass.com/), and DELPHI GLASS 
(http://www.delphiglass.com/more-crafts/), to name a few of the larger 
competitors.

We expect to face medium to high level of resistance when we enter the market,
where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire
new customers. Substantially all of our competitors have greater financial
resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we
can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants.
We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new
competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Our competition varies by product line, customer classification and geographic
market. The principal competitive factors in our industry are quality of
product, pricing, service and delivery capabilities and availability of product.
We will compete with many local, regional and national glass craft products
distributors and dealers. In addition, some glass craft products suppliers might
sell and distribute their products directly to our customers, and the volume of
such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, distributors of
products similar to those distributed by us, such as distributors of Chinese
made glass craft products, may elect to sell and distribute to our customers in
the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other
distributors.

Glass craft products are distributed by many companies as well as numerous
stores and websites in the USA. To compete with other companies, we plan to use
helpful customer service and offer a wide assortment of glass craft products at
competitive prices. We will take significant efforts to promote our product
using marketing and internet tools.


Company Description
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014 to engage in
the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass
craft products produced in China.

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute glass craft
products, in forms


 including but not limited to glass crafts, novelties, knobs,
trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays, plates. We currently have some
operating history which includes revenues and cost of sales. Our plan of
operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our
Offering is to develop and establish our glass craft products distribution
business and hire three more salespeople.

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the
initial equity funding by our sole officer and director.  We have generated some
revenues and our principal business activities to date have consisted of
creating a business plan and entering into a Supply Agreement, dated July 10,
2014, with three Chinese companies, Xiamen Ebei Import & Export Co., Ltd.
(“Xiamen Ebei”), Yangzhou Kanglong Glass Arts Co., Ltd. (“Yangzhou Kanglong”),
and Yancheng Sunrise Import & Export Co.,Ltd. (“Yancheng Sunrise”).  Xiamen
Ebei, Yangzhou Kanglong and Yancheng Sunrise are large and well-established
suppliers and distributors of glass craft products in China.  The terms and
conditions of the Supply Agreement provide that, among other things, we have the
right to purchase a variety of glass craft products (including crafts,
novelties, knobs, trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays and plates)
produced by each of the companies.

Our executive offices are located at 8153 Finch Feather St., Las Vegas, NV 
89143. On July 28, 2014 we purchased an office and small shop for US$8,000, 
located at: Jaunciema gatve 40, Zieme?u rajons, R?ga, LV-1023, Latvia. Our 
phone number is (775) 572-8824.
