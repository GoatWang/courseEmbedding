DALLAS and MUMBAI, India, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyOnMobile, Inc. (OTCQX: MOMT) today reported recent monthly operational results, including this highlight: 

3.9% compound monthly growth rate in revenue from December 2016 to April 2017









"We believe our increase in revenue speaks to two factors: strong demand for cash to digital services and our line of credit facility put in place in December 2016. The line of credit allowed us to expand our daily limits to increase the processing volume of domestic remittances, as seen in our strong monthly growth for this revenue category. Early returns from May demonstrate that this trend continues.  (See Chart B)," said Harold Montgomery, Chairman and CEO of MoneyOnMobile, Inc. 
"We saw an increase in monthly revenue from December to January as consumer demand and market conditions stabilized from the impact of demonetization. However, the business experienced a short-term impact in volume from mobile top-up sales due to mobile operators building market share by, we believe, temporarily providing heavily-discounted airtime minutes, data and video.  As a result, the mobile and TV top-up revenue categories are down a collective 28% and will negatively impact our overall Q4 revenue. We have seen mobile top-up and DTH revenue stabilize in May. We are seeing growth from emerging revenue lines, such as the MOM ATM (Chart B - All Other)," said Ranjeet Oak, Managing Director of MoneyOnMobile's India subsidiary.

MoneyOnMobile Announces 86% Growth in Domestic Remittance and MOM ATM Revenues From April to May 2017

All product categories increase




Jun 12, 2017, 7:20am EDT














DALLAS and MUMBAI, India, June 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --MoneyOnMobile, Inc. (OTCQX: MOMT) today reported increases in monthly revenue across all major product categories, including an 86% increase in domestic remittance and MOM ATM revenues from April to May 2017. 



"We are excited to see continued positive growth results from our products and services. The top two lines of the chart below represent significant revenue drivers of our business. We believe our domestic remittance (money transfer) business continues to grow based on the recent line of credit increases, which allows us to increase our daily processing capacity, and strong demand for these services in our target market," said Harold Montgomery, Chairman and CEO of MoneyOnMobile, Inc.
"We are encouraged with our significant growth in the MOM ATM product. Our retailers find significant value in our MOM ATM product as a way to differentiate their business from the competition. Having a product in their store that provides cash-out services and serves as a mobile point of sale solution in a country with limited financial infrastructure cements their relationship with MoneyOnMobile," said Ranjeet Oak, Managing Director of MoneyOnMobile's India subsidiary.
