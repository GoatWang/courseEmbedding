The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Bankruptcy
                      

IRAs and qualified plans have somewhat different rules regarding bankruptcy and creditor protection.
                      


 If an investor faces insolvency, he or she can look to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) for guidance on retirement assets that are shielded from federal bankruptcy. Effective for bankruptcies filed on or after 10/17/2005, all retirement accounts are protected in the event of individual bankruptcy, whether or not the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is applicable. This protection is also extended to IRAs. It is intended to shield retirement assets from creditors and prevents a participant's bankruptcy from causing the investor to lose assets that have been set aside for retirement.

Beneficiary
                      

Spouse? Non-spouse? Non-person? All can be named as IRA beneficiaries, but tax treatment can be very different.
                      


Naming a beneficiary using a beneficiary form provided by or accepted by the IRA custodian is very important. Why? What's written on the beneficiary designation form, not contained within the investor's will, determines who inherits the IRA. In other words, IRAs do not pass through probate.

                      Estate Tax
                      
                    
Like all assets, IRAs must be considered as part of the estate plan. But to whom the account is left can make a significant difference.
                      


Estate planning is critical to preserving wealth for future generations. The estate tax or "death tax" is a federal and or state tax placed on a decedent's asset transfer. A gross estate includes the value of all property in which the decedent had an interest at the time of death, including employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs. Whether an estate will be subject to estate taxes depends on the year of death, the gross estate's value, the amount of debt, the expense of settling the estate, and any available deductions.

IRA versus Qualified Plan Beneficiary Rules
                      

Are there different rules when it comes to naming an IRA beneficiary versus a qualified plan beneficiary?
                      


By law, qualified plans, such as a 401(k)s, require the participant's spouse to be the designated 100% beneficiary. In order for a married 401(k) plan participant to name any other person as beneficiary, the spouse must waive his or her rights as beneficiary in writing, and most plans require that any spousal waiver be witnessed by a notary public. In addition, a new beneficiary must be named.

Naming a Trust
                      

Why would an IRA account owner want to name a trust or non-person as a beneficiary?
                      


One type of frequently used trust is called a "see-through" trust. It creates a mechanism for the deceased to control account withdrawals, post-death. In addition, a see-through trust allows the underlying beneficiary to "stretch" distributions over their life expectancy. Prior to naming a trust as a beneficiary, an investor needs to be aware of the complex rules that govern trust beneficiaries.

When appreciated company stock is a portion of a retirement plan distribution, recipients may benefit by transferring the shares to a brokerage account while rolling the non-stock assets to an IRA. A special provision known as net unrealized appreciation (NUA) allows a plan participant to potentially take advantage of lower tax rates.
The NUA tax break on lump-sum distributions from a qualified plan allows participants to trade ordinary federal income tax rates1 (39.6% top marginal bracket in 2016) for long-term capital gains treatment (maximum of 20%). To take advantage, a participant would transfer his/her company stock to a brokerage account (non-IRA) paying ordinary income tax on the amount the stock cost (basis) only. Subsequently, when sold, the stock would be subject to long-term capital gains rates, currently 15% or 20% depending on income. Long-term capital gains treatment applies even if the stock is sold prior to being held for one year.
To be eligible to receive NUA tax-treatment, a number of specific rules need to be followed including:

Distribution must qualify as a “lump-sum.”
Distribution must be due to certain events including: 59½ (if plan permits), separation from service, retirement.


Assuming you NUA-qualify, you will not pay current income tax on the stock appreciation. Instead, in the year of distribution you would be subject to income tax on the basis only. However, depending on age and when separation occurs, there may be a 10% penalty in addition to paying ordinary income tax on the amount of basis placed in the brokerage. As shares are sold, only capital gains2 taxes apply to the shares sold, so the individual would then pay tax on the appreciation of the shares above the cost basis at a long-term, capital gains2 rate based on the initial transfer. It does not matter how long the shares were owned during plan participation.
Please consult an IRA specialist at 888-522-2388 for additional information.

1 Income taxes can be postponed until a later date; examples include IRAs and 401(k) plan earnings.
2 An increase in the value of a capital asset, such as a mutual fund or a common stock. If the asset is sold, the gain is a realized capital gain, which may be either short term (one year or less) or long term (more than one year).







There may be fees, expenses, taxes, and penalties associated with early IRA withdrawals.
Lord Abbett will waive (or otherwise pay) the yearly $10.00 custodial fee that would be charged each year on an ongoing basis to every new IRA account and, therefore, will not assess a custodial account fee in 2016 or any year afterward. Fund level fees and expenses are still applicable. Please see the current prospectus.

Breaking Through Barriers
	
May 24, 2012

To create growth in your practice, institutionalize your operational systems.




















This Practice Management article is intended for financial advisors only (registered representatives of broker dealers or associated persons of Registered Investment Advisors).
 




















The first few months of a new year is an ideal time for a company founder to make sure the business is ready to climb to the next level of success. That is not an easy task and, for planning firm owners, it may require taking some time away from daily business operations. But the potential payoff is worth the effort.
The Growth Process
In the world of financial services, advisory firms grow through the talent, drive and energy of their founders. Each firm's character is determined by the entrepreneur's inclinations, style and experience, creating a driven, dynamic environment, based equally on ambition, energy and potential. As firms grow, their founders face the challenges of imbuing them with their energy and vision, creating business structures that deliver high-quality services, adding staff to support growth and systematizing services to allow for scale and growth.
But just when firms have grown to a point that they need staff, systems and scale, their founders are overwhelmed in managing it all and struggling to keep up, much less to do the extra work of working on the business. In this atmosphere, there is never time to build the business. Running the business distracts you from growing the business, and working in the business distracts you from working on the business.
Also, owners continue to work in almost every aspect of the firm, as they did when it began. To this end, an owner has filled every business capacity—executive, manager, professional and staff. When the firm expands, the owner hires and hands off specific tasks to others, but remains the controlling force over all aspects of the business.
This overwhelming control that the owner exerts over the business may become disruptive to the office as firm members begin to independently develop systems and procedures in order to complete tasks without the owner's involvement.
As the owner tries to keep up with a growing business and firm members attempt to establish their own informal systems for doing work, the owner often experiences a sense of loss of control. The firm seems to be growing beyond the ability of a single person to control it; the owner can find herself or himself chasing the business instead of managing it—an incredibly frustrating and exhausting experience.
Solving Personnel Issues 
As a firm expands, personnel may be hired in an informal manner based on the demand of the workload and outside of the context of a well-thought-out organizational structure. Difficult and costly staffing issues can arise in these circumstances. Some common personnel-related problems include:
* A revolving door. If there are no systems in place to govern work, turnover can cause problems with workflow and quality. Without systems in place, employees create their own informal practices through trial and error. These practices allow the employees to do work, but if an employee leaves, the informal practices leave with him or her. The next hire needs to create new practices in order to do the work, leading to inconsistency and inefficiency during the transition.

* Hiring and firing issues. Hiring issues stem from a lack of clarity about the positions needed for the business to run optimally and a lack of systems during the hiring process to assure that the best possible candidates are hired. Hiring issues can lead to a revolving door situation if the wrong people are hired.

Firing issues stem from a lack of review processes and procedures. Employee review should include regular formal reviews, monitoring of work through accountability procedures and documentation of issues. Without proper documentation, if problems worsen with an employee, the firm may find itself in a difficult legal position.

* Culture issues. Your firm's culture is the atmosphere created by the way firm members interact. The best firms have a team-based progressive culture. When a firm has problems with personnel, morale problems can result, leading to a decrease in efficiency that can be self-aggravating. Culture issues can be difficult to overcome, since negative feelings feed on themselves.
 
Production and Quality Issues 
Without systems that govern work, production and quality issues become magnified as a firm grows. Employees are too busy doing work to create better systems, or they are micromanaged by owners who want to let go, but can't. When problems with quality or service occur, it can be frustrating both for the owner, who wants to provide high-quality service, and for staff members, who can feel overwhelmed or resentful of the owner's micromanaging style.
To turn service and quality issues into positive experiences, it is necessary to step back from the daily workload and work on the business, creating systems and improving processes. The conflict between working in the business and working on the business is not easily resolved; it's a challenge to carve out the necessary time to build your business.
 
Seizing Opportunities 
Opportunities are always around you. There are untapped referrals and additional business from existing clients, opportunities to do seminars and the possibility of forming fruitful alliances with other professionals. When overwhelmed with the work that you have and continuously struggling to keep up, you can't capitalize on opportunities that exist. The work that needs to be done is too dependent on you; you lack the time and energy to take advantage of the opportunity that is all around you.
Entrepreneurs face the challenge of putting business systems into place that create an efficient and effective office. This takes time and energy that they will typically feel, at a gut level, should be used to do work or to market. This is the core frustration of the entrepreneurial barrier. You want to move beyond your current limitations, but what's holding you back is not a lack of opportunity or ability, it's your own business.
Breaking the entrepreneurial barrier is daunting, but it can be done. Ultimately, the way to make progress is to slow down for a short time and become not an owner but an executive in charge of strategically overseeing your business. Find ways to plan and carry out change, whether that involves hiring additional staff, evaluating the firm's services and fees, hiring professional management, restructuring how you spend your time or reorganizing your staff to create leverage. Regardless of which changes are right for you, you will find that on the other side of the entrepreneurial barrier lies a business, not just a practice.
Firms tend to grow in spurts, as the business hits critical points in its development. These critical points occur as a firm makes internal changes to break through bottlenecks in capacity, finds new income streams or makes other essential shifts. The work toward these changes is evolutionary, involving thoughtful decision-making. Once the changes are in place, the results for a firm can be revolutionary.
 
Recognizing Barriers 
To break through the barriers to achieve revolutionary growth, it is essential to recognize those barriers to growth. One of the most common is the equation of time = money. With a finite staff and time, you can only do a finite amount of work. How can a firm with limited capacity break through this equation to increase profits without adding more staff?
One answer is to do more work in a given amount of time. Improving the work/time ratio is accomplished through increased efficiency. There are two important contributing factors to your work/time ratio: efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency is how fast the work is completed. Effectiveness is how well the work is completed. Doing better work often takes more time.
But to create an efficient work environment without sacrificing effectiveness requires the development of work systems. When Henry Ford devised the assembly line to build the Model T, it allowed him to increase production to the point where he could reduce prices, raise wages and still earn more profit through increased sales. What Ford recognized was the potential of well-defined systems, and his systems created a revolution in the automobile industry and established precedents for all industry.
Service firms can learn a lesson from this as well. Whether the result of a system is a car or something less tangible, like personalized client service, systems get the work done faster without a loss of effectiveness. This applies in both client service and internal processes.
Your firm already has practices for doing the work that comes in, but these practices have probably evolved over time as new employees have joined the staff. They are probably not the result of a thoughtful plan. They may not be well documented, and they may never have been reviewed to see if they could be more efficient and more effective.
 
A Systems Approach 
Evaluating, creating and documenting systems is a time-consuming task, but it is essential to creating a well-run firm. To do this most effectively, your firm may need an operations manager or COO who can manage this task.
The first step is to create a list of the systems that need to be evaluated. You have procedures for using technology, procedures for workflow through your firm, procedures for marketing your firm and procedures for servicing your clients. Sitting down and making a comprehensive list of every structure that you need to create or evaluate and then document is a daunting task, but it is important to take this simple step first.
Even if you have documented procedures, they probably are not comprehensive. The power of a list is that it organizes your thoughts and gives you a concrete number of tasks that need to be accomplished. Once you have a list, you can work through each system, one by one, to evaluate it and document it, creating procedures where they are lacking and improving them where they exist.
 
Questions to Ask 
When evaluating and documenting systems, ask yourself:

What tasks are necessary to get the work done? Include tasks that are done outside the office, such as getting materials from clients or business contacts.
Who will be responsible for doing each task? How can the labor be divided most efficiently among staff members?
Is each staff member doing the tasks for which he or she is best suited?
How will each person know he or she needs to do a specific task?
Who is responsible for following up on tasks being done by clients or firms?
How much time should it take to do each task? Can multiple tasks be done more quickly if they're done together?
Who needs to know the status of the work? How will they know?
What supporting materials (forms, software) are needed to make sure the tasks are done? Do these materials exist or do they need to be developed?

Documenting a system is necessary to developing the system. If the system is not written down and supporting materials are not created or implemented, the system will break down quickly.
Once systems are developed and documented, the next step is putting the system into effect. Familiarize workers with the systems, train them to follow the steps and encourage them to give input on the procedures so that the systems can be improved when possible.
Implement your systems in a formal way so that your employees know that systems are a priority. It may be hard to adjust to new systems. Be open to feedback, which can help you improve the systems you are implementing, but also be aware that change often comes with resistance. Requiring staff members to sign a statement that they have read and understand procedures and will follow them underlines the importance of those procedures.
The key to breaking the entrepreneurial barrier is in formalizing and institutionalizing how your firm does business, across the business. This also gives the firm greater value as a business because the formalized procedures are teachable and repeatable, instead of being dependent on the current personnel. They are also scalable, given that they are driven by the firm's process rather than by its people and their preferences.
Once the business has reached this stage, the ability to grow and to merge, acquire or exit improves significantly—as does value. As you face the road ahead and the challenge of doing business during challenging economic times, making the most of the business you have is a sure-fire way to make the most of the year ahead.
