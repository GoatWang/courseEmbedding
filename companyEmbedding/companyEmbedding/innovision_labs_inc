(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our product offerings, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify such forward-looking statements by the words "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "believes," "estimates," "likely," "goal," "assumes," "targets" and similar expressions and/or the use of future tense or conditional constructions (such as "will," "may," "could," "should" and the like) and by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date such statements are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. We undertake no obligation to update, and we do not have a policy of updating or revising, these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. Please see Item 1A "Risk Factors" contained in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, as may be updated by our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "InnoVision," "we," "us" and "our" refer to InnoVision Labs, Inc., a Nevada corporation, including its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Ucansi Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as Ucansi, and EYEKON E.R.D. Ltd, an Israeli company, which comprise our operating subsidiaries and all of our operations as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The discussion and analysis of InnoVision's financial condition and results of operations are based on InnoVision's financial statements, which InnoVision has prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires InnoVision to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, InnoVision evaluates such estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. InnoVision bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that InnoVision believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Business  We are a visual neuroscience software technology company, utilizing patented technology to develop and commercialize consumer-oriented software applications for improving, through exercise, vision sharpness and vision performance by improving the image processing function in the visual cortex of the brain. We deliver our scientific products through a game-like experience based on mobile applications, referred to as apps.  Our first app, GlassesOff(TM), aims to eliminate, through exercise, the dependency on reading glasses of people over the age of 40 who experience natural age-related changes in their near vision sharpness. The GlassesOff(TM) app is currently implemented on the Android and Apple iOS platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) and is available on the main app markets, such as the Apple App Store and The Google Play store.  Our new app, Game Vision, is based on sports themes, with a go-to-market strategy of partnering with known athletes as "brand partners". We launched the first Game Vision app, featuring 9-time All-Star Chris Paul, on March 3, 2016. While this app is designed as a casual, fun-to-play game, it is based on extensive neuroscience research and patent pending technology that aim to enhance, through exercise, a user's vision performance and brain processing speed. We expect that our new app will draw interest from athletes and sports enthusiasts of all ages.  Plan of Operation  During December 2013, we completed the development of the first commercial version of our consumer-oriented software application for improving, through exercise, near vision sharpness by improving the brain's image processing function, for the iOS platform and began marketing the product to end consumers via Apple's App Store. On June 30, 2014, we launched the first version of our software application for the Android platform as a beta version and subsequently in final form.  In the third quarter of 2015, we signed an agreement with 9-time All-Star Chris Paul as a brand partner for our first sports app. We launched Chris Paul's Game Vision on March 3, 2016. We expect to advertise and market our app based on the popularity and reputation of this athlete, as a brand partner. Additionally, we plan to participate in various conferences and conventions internationally to further expose our products and technology to professionals, such as ophthalmologists, sports coaches and associations, and potentially form business partnerships.  During 2016, we plan to re-launch the GlassesOff(TM) app under a new dynamic game-like technology as well as pursue additional partnerships with top athletes in other sports.  We are not currently planning any major purchase or sale of equipment in 2016.  Critical Accounting Policies  A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, referred to as the 2015 Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates previously reported in our 2015 Form 10-K.  Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which often requires that management make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our unaudited interim financial statements.  Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that our accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition, intangible assets, convertible notes and stock based compensation are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. We believe there have been no material changes in our existing accounting policies and estimates from the disclosures included in the 2015 Form 10-K, except for the newly adopted accounting policies as disclosed in Note 2 to the unaudited interim financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 2 to the unaudited interim financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  Revenue  InnoVision generated revenues of $113,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to revenues of $47,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase in revenues was mostly due to the launch of a French version of the GlassesOff(TM) app and significant media coverage in France, which resulted in increased sales.  Cost of Sales  Cost of sales consists primarily of commissions, royalties and amortization of intangible assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, InnoVision incurred costs of sales aggregating $89,000, as compared to $59,000 in the 2015 period. The increase in costs of sales for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted primarily from increase in platform commissions and royalties of $22,000. The increase in platform commissions and royalties resulted from the increase in revenues.  Research and Development Expenses  InnoVision expects its research and development, referred to as R&D, expenses to increase as it continues to develop its products. R&D expenses consist of:  � internal costs associated with R&D activities;  � personnel-related expenses, including salaries and stock-based compensation expenses, benefits, travel and related costs for the personnel involved in R&D;  � internal and external costs associated with scientific studies, including payments to investigators and labs participating in the studies, payments to purchase and/or use equipment required for such studies and payments to subjects for participating in the subject studies;  � patent application fees;  � outsource services associated with R&D activities; and  � facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities.  InnoVision expects its R&D expenses to increase in the near future in connection with its development efforts for the re-launch of GlassesOff(TM), including new product versions for new territories (localization), new devices and platforms, and potentially new product applications. InnoVision intends to continue the use of outsourced development services to expedite its development efforts. InnoVision believes that investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plans to continue these investments in an effort to realize the potential of its current and planned products.  For the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, InnoVision incurred R&D expenses in the aggregate of $261,000 and $564,000, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in payroll expenses of $170,000, outsource services and consulting expenses of $62,000 and stock-based compensation expenses of $68,000. The decrease in payroll expenses was primarily due to engaging a third party provider for assistance with development of the Game Vision app and the subsequent departure of five employees during 2015. We terminated an agreement with a third party provider at the end of 2015, resulting in reduced expenditures in outsource services and consulting expenses in the 2016 period. In addition, InnoVision capitalized to intangible assets $68,000 of payroll expenses in 2016, as compared to $32,000 in 2015. The decrease in stock-based compensation expenses resulted primarily from the completion of the vesting of a portion of certain options and shares of restricted Common Stock that were granted in prior years to employees, forfeiture of a portion of the unvested options during 2015 and the decrease in the fair value of options that were granted to consultants in the 2016 period.  Sales and Marketing Expenses  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for employees of InnoVision and external service providers for services, such as public relations services, advertising costs and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities. During 2015 and the three month period ended March 31, 2016, InnoVision continued to invest in building marketing infrastructure, which included, among other things, developing public relations networks to generate awareness of GlassesOff(TM) and Game Vision, preparing marketing materials and building a network of eye care professionals to support and promote the GlassesOff(TM) and Game Vision technology and planned products. InnoVision expects its sales and marketing expenses to increase in the near future in connection with the expected re-launch of GlassesOff(TM), including new product versions for new territories (localization).For the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, InnoVision incurred sales and marketing expenses of $344,000and $273,000, respectively. The increase for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted primarily from an increase in payroll expenses of $57,000. The increase in payroll expenses was mostly due to the costs associated with the marketing activities targeting the French market and the preparation for the planned launch of our Game Vision(TM) app. We do not expect that payroll expenses will increase materially in the near future.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative, referred to as G&A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses for persons serving in InnoVision's executive and administration functions. Other G&A expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in R&D or sales and marketing expenses, and professional fees for legal and accounting services, including those associated with reporting obligations applicable to public companies in the United States. InnoVision does not expect that its G&A expenses will change materially in the near future.  For the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, InnoVision incurred G&A expenses of $254,000 and $362,000, respectively. The decrease for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted primarily from the decrease of $15,000 in payroll expenses, $13,000 in fees for accounting services, $11,000 in stock-based compensation expenses, $18,000 in travel expenses and a one-time expense for investment bankers fees of $15,000 in 2015.  Financial Expenses and Income  Financial expenses and income consist of the following:  � interest earned on InnoVision's cash and cash equivalents;  � bank fees and commissions;  � expenses or income resulting from fluctuations of the NIS, in which a portion of InnoVision's assets and liabilities is denominated, against the U.S. Dollar; and  � interest expenses.  For the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, InnoVision incurred net financial expenses (income) of $266,000 and $(5,000), respectively. The increase in financial expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period was primarily due to interest expenses related to InnoVision's 8.0% Senior Convertible Notes, referred to as the Notes, of $252,000 in 2016 as compared to $0 in 2015. The interest expenses related to the Notes primarily represented accrued interest of $48,000 and amortization of the discount of $204,000 on the $2.86 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes.  Stock-based Compensation  InnoVision's stock-based compensation expenses with respect to employees are recorded according to ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options under InnoVision's stock plans, based on estimated fair values.  ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in InnoVision's consolidated statement of operations.  InnoVision applies ASC 505-50, "Equity Based Payments to Non Employees", with respect to options issued to non-employees.  InnoVision estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. For the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, InnoVision's stock-based compensation expenses were $107,000 and $181,000, respectively. Stock-based compensation expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 decreased as compared to the 2015 period primarily due to completion of the vesting of certain options and shares of restricted Common Stock that were granted in prior years, forfeiture of a portion of the unvested options during the year 2015 and a decrease in the fair value of options that were granted to consultants in the 2016 period.  Cash Flows  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operations was $590,000 and $831,000, respectively. Cash was used primarily for salaries, subcontractors and software development expenses, facility-related costs and professional fees. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted primarily from the departure of five employees due to our engagement of a third party provider for assistance with the development of the Game Vision app. The third party provider services were terminated by the end of 2015 leading to a decrease in subcontractor expenses during the 2016 period. It is expected that cash used in operating activities will increase as we plan to re-launch GlassesOff(TM), including new product versions for new territories (localization), new devices and platforms and potentially new products.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $91,000 and $46,000, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted primarily from capitalization of intangible assets of $90,000 in 2016, as compared to $46,000 in 2015.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $1,058,000 and $0, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period resulted from InnoVision's issuance and sale of $1,060,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes in 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  InnoVision expects to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future and incur increasing R&D expenses, including expenses related to outsourcing of certain development projects. InnoVision also expects that sales and marketing expenses will increase in connection with the commercialization activities related to the re-launch of GlassesOff(TM) and its localized versions. InnoVision's future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the continued progress of R&D of its products, cost of potential partnerships with known athletes, and the total average cost of customer acquisition, comprising initial acquisition cost and customer retention cost.  Based on our 2016 average monthly cash expenses and our cash balance as of March 31, 2016, we expect that we will require additional financing of approximately $1,700,000 for the 12 month period ending March 31, 2017. InnoVision plans to continue to finance its operations with the issuance of equity or debt securities and, in the longer term, revenues from operations. There are no assurances, however, that InnoVision will be successful in obtaining the financing necessary for the long-term development of its current product or future products. InnoVision's future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including requirements for investment in re-launching GlassesOff(TM), developing new product versions for new territories (localization), new devices and new platforms, and potential development of new products. Furthermore, the expected ramp-up in sales and marketing activities will require significantly higher resources. InnoVision generated only limited revenues for 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016. InnoVision expects continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations over the next 12 months. To the extent that InnoVision's current capital resources are insufficient to meet its future capital requirements, InnoVision will need to finance its future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements.  On July 1, 2014, InnoVision entered into a standby equity distribution agreement, referred to as the SEDA, with YA Global Master SPV Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership, referred to as the Investor. As previously disclosed, under the SEDA, InnoVision was able to elect from time to time, in its sole discretion, to sell to the Investor up to an aggregate of $15,000,000 of shares of Common Stock. Effective May 9, 2016, InnoVision and the Investor mutually agreed to terminate the SEDA.  InnoVision currently does not have any commitments for future external funding. InnoVision will need to raise additional funds, and it may decide to raise additional funds even before it needs such funds if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. InnoVision may seek to issue equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility from one or more financial institutions or otherwise. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to its existing stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject InnoVision to covenants that restrict its operations. Additional equity or debt financing, or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, InnoVision may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate its R&D programs, reduce its planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require InnoVision to relinquish rights to certain potential products that it might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. InnoVision's ability to continue to operate as a going concern is dependent upon additional financial support.  Effects of Inflation and Currency Fluctuations  Inflation generally affects InnoVision by increasing its cost of labor and other development costs. InnoVision does not believe that inflation had a material effect on its results of operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.  Currency fluctuations may affect InnoVision by increasing or decreasing costs. Currency fluctuations had no material effect on InnoVision's results of operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. InnoVision does not purchase forward currency contracts or engage in other hedging arrangements for either hedging or speculative purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  InnoVision has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

NEW YORK, January 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
- Product portfolio expanded, includes a sports app in partnership with Clippers point guard Chris Paul for enhancement of image processing speed, and an app for improvement of near vision sharpness aiming to eliminate dependency on reading glasses , both through brain exercises.
- The company will start trading under the INVS symbol starting January 22. 
InnoVision Labs, Inc. (OTCBB: INVS) announced today the company's new name, InnoVision Labs, Inc., and new trading symbol INVS. The new InnoVision Labs name is part of the company's expanded product portfolio, which now includes apps for (i) sports - focusing on vision processing speed exercises, and (ii) reading - focusing on near vision sharpness training. Under the enhancement of image sharpness business segment, GlassesOff™ will remain the brand name of the existing mobile application that aims to eliminate dependency on reading glasses. Game Vision™ will be the brand name used for the upcoming mobile applications with a focus on sports vision performance, the first of which is scheduled to be launched in the first quarter of 2016, in partnership with Chris Paul, eight-time all-star basketball player and Los Angeles Clippers point guard.
Nimrod Madar, CEO of InnoVision Labs, said: "The new name reflects the two core pillars of the company's DNA: innovation and vision performance. It represents our commitment to invest heavily in scientific research, aiming to continuously enhance the efficacy of our existing technologies while pursuing further innovation to fuel our growth with new products that will drive the growth of our product portfolio."

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
