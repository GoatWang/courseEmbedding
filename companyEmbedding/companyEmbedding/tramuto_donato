Early life and education[edit]
At age 7 a middle-ear infection left Tramuto unable to hear or speak clearly. Ten years later a surgical operation restored some but not all of his hearing and fluency.[10][11]
Tramuto attended Wadhams Hall Seminary-College from 1975 to 1979, graduating with a B.A. degree in philosophy. He then studied healthcare marketing at the State University of New York–Buffalo for two years.[12][13]
Business career[edit]
Tramuto taught for a semester at Gannon, a Roman Catholic diocesan university, before making a career change to pharmaceutical marketing at Marion Laboratories.[14]
From 1982 to 1990 Tramuto worked at Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, becoming district manager. He then was hired by Caremark as its vice president for Disease Management Marketing and general manager of its Home Healthcare business unit.[15] He spent four years advocating and directing the development of the company's first AIDS management program.[16]
In 1998 Tramuto co-founded Protocare, Inc., a drug development firm with a healthcare-services consulting division.[15] In 2002 he sold one part to Radiant Research and the other to Constella Health Strategies, which was integrated into UnitedHealth Group a year later.[13][17]
In 2008 Tramuto left UnitedHealth Group and founded Physicians Interactive Holdings, which provided mobile and Web-based medical reference tools, electronic drug sampling, and interactive education to the healthcare industry. Venture capital was supplied by Perseus, a private equity firm.[18] The company's proprietary technology could be used to transmit a patient's medical data to a physician through a handheld device. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, physicians there used it to communicate with medical experts in the U.S.[19]
In 2013 Perseus sold the company to Merck, with Tramuto remaining in place as CEO.[18]
In May 2013 Tramuto was elected to serve as an outside director of health-and-wellness company Healthways Inc.; its shareholders had voted to declassify its staggered board of directors after the New York State Common Retirement Fund claimed that the directors had entrenched themselves.[20] He was appointed chairman a year later.[21] In 2015 the company announced his appointment as president and CEO,[6][15] passing over a corporate officer who had applied for the job.[22]
In July 2016 Tramuto sold Healthways' unprofitable population-health business, along with its brand name, to allow the company to focus on its fitness and rehabilitation programs, under a new name ("Tivity Health").[7][8]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, Tramuto established a nonprofit, Health eVillages, to distribute handheld devices loaded with medical reference materials to healthcare workers in remote regions of the world.[23] In 2014 the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights gave him an RFK Ripple of Hope award for his charitable work in the global healthcare field.[1][4]
In 2016 Tramuto wrote a memoir about obstacles he had encountered in early life and traumatic events that had caused him to feel survivor guilt; he said that these experiences ("life's bulldozer moments") motivated him to succeed in business and do charitable work.[24]
Political activities[edit]
Tramuto was elected to the Town of Ogunquit's Board of Selectmen in 2006 on a write-in campaign. He served two three-year terms. While chairman (2007–12), he represented the town to the governor of Maine on issues related to education and health.[14][25] In 2010 the governor appointed him to the State of Maine Economic Growth Council, which develops and evaluates the state's long-term economic growth plan.[19][26]

Early life and education[edit]
At age 7 a middle-ear infection left Tramuto unable to hear or speak clearly. Ten years later a surgical operation restored some but not all of his hearing and fluency.[10][11]
Tramuto attended Wadhams Hall Seminary-College from 1975 to 1979, graduating with a B.A. degree in philosophy. He then studied healthcare marketing at the State University of New York–Buffalo for two years.[12][13]
Business career[edit]
Tramuto taught for a semester at Gannon, a Roman Catholic diocesan university, before making a career change to pharmaceutical marketing at Marion Laboratories.[14]
From 1982 to 1990 Tramuto worked at Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, becoming district manager. He then was hired by Caremark as its vice president for Disease Management Marketing and general manager of its Home Healthcare business unit.[15] He spent four years advocating and directing the development of the company's first AIDS management program.[16]
In 1998 Tramuto co-founded Protocare, Inc., a drug development firm with a healthcare-services consulting division.[15] In 2002 he sold one part to Radiant Research and the other to Constella Health Strategies, which was integrated into UnitedHealth Group a year later.[13][17]
In 2008 Tramuto left UnitedHealth Group and founded Physicians Interactive Holdings, which provided mobile and Web-based medical reference tools, electronic drug sampling, and interactive education to the healthcare industry. Venture capital was supplied by Perseus, a private equity firm.[18] The company's proprietary technology could be used to transmit a patient's medical data to a physician through a handheld device. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, physicians there used it to communicate with medical experts in the U.S.[19]
In 2013 Perseus sold the company to Merck, with Tramuto remaining in place as CEO.[18]
In May 2013 Tramuto was elected to serve as an outside director of health-and-wellness company Healthways Inc.; its shareholders had voted to declassify its staggered board of directors after the New York State Common Retirement Fund claimed that the directors had entrenched themselves.[20] He was appointed chairman a year later.[21] In 2015 the company announced his appointment as president and CEO,[6][15] passing over a corporate officer who had applied for the job.[22]
In July 2016 Tramuto sold Healthways' unprofitable population-health business, along with its brand name, to allow the company to focus on its fitness and rehabilitation programs, under a new name ("Tivity Health").[7][8]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, Tramuto established a nonprofit, Health eVillages, to distribute handheld devices loaded with medical reference materials to healthcare workers in remote regions of the world.[23] In 2014 the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights gave him an RFK Ripple of Hope award for his charitable work in the global healthcare field.[1][4]
In 2016 Tramuto wrote a memoir about obstacles he had encountered in early life and traumatic events that had caused him to feel survivor guilt; he said that these experiences ("life's bulldozer moments") motivated him to succeed in business and do charitable work.[24]
Political activities[edit]
Tramuto was elected to the Town of Ogunquit's Board of Selectmen in 2006 on a write-in campaign. He served two three-year terms. While chairman (2007–12), he represented the town to the governor of Maine on issues related to education and health.[14][25] In 2010 the governor appointed him to the State of Maine Economic Growth Council, which develops and evaluates the state's long-term economic growth plan.[19][26]

NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- In recognition of his three-decade commitment to creating social change through the advancement of healthcare and human rights across the globe, last night Donato Tramuto, the CEO and Chairman of Physicians Interactive (PI), was honored with the 2014 Ripple of Hope Award from the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. 
Tramuto was one of four recipients of this prestigious award. He stands in good company as the other three honorees in 2014 were former Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton, Academy Award winner Robert De Niro and Grammy Award winner Tony Bennett. Past honorees include President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Grammy Award winner Bono and Academy Award winner George Clooney.
"While this award was given to me as an individual, I accept it on behalf of all the people at the business and philanthropic organizations I have had the privilege of leading, without whose contributions I wouldn't be standing here today," said Tramuto. "I am humbled by their dedication and commitment to helping me make the world a little better for so many. As Senator Kennedy said, 'Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.' Those words inspired me as a child attempting to overcome my own disabilities, and they continue to inspire me today. I am honored to be recognized for trying to live up to Senator Kennedy's ideals." 
The RFK Ripple of Hope Award recognizes leaders of the international business, entertainment and activist communities who demonstrate an unmatched commitment to social change. Honorees reflect the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy's passion for equality, justice and basic human rights. It was created to honor ideals Senator Kennedy cited in a speech at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in 1966:
"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice," Sen. Kennedy said that day, "he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."  
Tramuto's personal challenges with severe hearing loss in his youth, and later the tragic death of his sister-in-law during childbirth, drove him to improve healthcare with affordable, accessible solutions.  Because of his own disability, he has made it his personal commitment to help those who have had significant challenges in their lives. 
"Donato has been a relentless advocate throughout his career in addressing needs across the globe," said Kerry Kennedy, the late Senator's daughter and President of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. "For more than 30 years, he has demonstrated the passion for making the world more just through his philanthropic and business initiatives that reflect my father's ideals. From his work on HIV/AIDS education to his founding of The Tramuto Foundation and Health eVillages, Donato's leadership in making the world a better place has been inspiring and embodies the values my father held."
At Physicians Interactive, Tramuto has worked tirelessly to use digital communications to improve connections and build trust between physicians and life sciences companies in order to improve healthcare processes and positively impact patient outcomes.  Tramuto also led the way in developing many key healthcare programs, including the first HIV/AIDS Arthur Ashe workplace education program in 1991, followed by the launch of a national HIV Provider Network focused on comprehensive disease management.  
In 2001, he founded The Tramuto Foundation following the September 11 terrorist attacks in honor of two close friends and their 3-year-old son who were on United Flight 175, the second plane to hit the World Trade Center. The Tramuto Foundation provides educational grants to youths with unique challenges to help overcome adversity and build the confidence necessary to achieve personal excellence.
Over the last 13 years, The Tramuto Foundation provided financial assistance to several individuals, families and programs in need. It provided funding to rebuild the home of a Hurricane Katrina family with a special needs child; a full sponsorship grant to teach English to an entire Cambodian village; the support of an Emergency Healthcare Services program with an AIDS/HIV center; the installation of advanced technology at a Maine playhouse to allow the hearing impaired to enjoy the performances; and the funding of high school education of four young adults in need through a partner organization in Kenya.  Recently, the Foundation also announced the approval of four five-year grants to address gaps in healthcare and education around the globe.
In 2011, following the devastating effects from the earthquake in Haiti, Tramuto and Physicians Interactive partnered with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights to create Health eVillages, an effort to "heal-the-villages" both in Haiti and around the world. Today, Health eVillages provides handheld devices, such as smartphones, iPod Touches and iPads, preloaded with specialized medical reference content and clinical decision support tools powered by the Omnio medical app, to clinicians in the most challenging clinical environments worldwide. 
In October, as concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus grew, Tramuto established the Health eVillages Collaborative Coalition to give healthcare professionals around the world free access to information and timely updates on the disease through the Web and mobile applications. Its goal is to educate clinicians on safe preventive practices, treatment, and to educate the public/patients to reduce some of the unwarranted panic surrounding the virus.

Early life and education[edit]
At age 7 a middle-ear infection left Tramuto unable to hear or speak clearly. Ten years later a surgical operation restored some but not all of his hearing and fluency.[10][11]
Tramuto attended Wadhams Hall Seminary-College from 1975 to 1979, graduating with a B.A. degree in philosophy. He then studied healthcare marketing at the State University of New York–Buffalo for two years.[12][13]
Business career[edit]
Tramuto taught for a semester at Gannon, a Roman Catholic diocesan university, before making a career change to pharmaceutical marketing at Marion Laboratories.[14]
From 1982 to 1990 Tramuto worked at Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, becoming district manager. He then was hired by Caremark as its vice president for Disease Management Marketing and general manager of its Home Healthcare business unit.[15] He spent four years advocating and directing the development of the company's first AIDS management program.[16]
In 1998 Tramuto co-founded Protocare, Inc., a drug development firm with a healthcare-services consulting division.[15] In 2002 he sold one part to Radiant Research and the other to Constella Health Strategies, which was integrated into UnitedHealth Group a year later.[13][17]
In 2008 Tramuto left UnitedHealth Group and founded Physicians Interactive Holdings, which provided mobile and Web-based medical reference tools, electronic drug sampling, and interactive education to the healthcare industry. Venture capital was supplied by Perseus, a private equity firm.[18] The company's proprietary technology could be used to transmit a patient's medical data to a physician through a handheld device. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, physicians there used it to communicate with medical experts in the U.S.[19]
In 2013 Perseus sold the company to Merck, with Tramuto remaining in place as CEO.[18]
In May 2013 Tramuto was elected to serve as an outside director of health-and-wellness company Healthways Inc.; its shareholders had voted to declassify its staggered board of directors after the New York State Common Retirement Fund claimed that the directors had entrenched themselves.[20] He was appointed chairman a year later.[21] In 2015 the company announced his appointment as president and CEO,[6][15] passing over a corporate officer who had applied for the job.[22]
In July 2016 Tramuto sold Healthways' unprofitable population-health business, along with its brand name, to allow the company to focus on its fitness and rehabilitation programs, under a new name ("Tivity Health").[7][8]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, Tramuto established a nonprofit, Health eVillages, to distribute handheld devices loaded with medical reference materials to healthcare workers in remote regions of the world.[23] In 2014 the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights gave him an RFK Ripple of Hope award for his charitable work in the global healthcare field.[1][4]
In 2016 Tramuto wrote a memoir about obstacles he had encountered in early life and traumatic events that had caused him to feel survivor guilt; he said that these experiences ("life's bulldozer moments") motivated him to succeed in business and do charitable work.[24]
Political activities[edit]
Tramuto was elected to the Town of Ogunquit's Board of Selectmen in 2006 on a write-in campaign. He served two three-year terms. While chairman (2007–12), he represented the town to the governor of Maine on issues related to education and health.[14][25] In 2010 the governor appointed him to the State of Maine Economic Growth Council, which develops and evaluates the state's long-term economic growth plan.[19][26]

Early life and education[edit]
At age 7 a middle-ear infection left Tramuto unable to hear or speak clearly. Ten years later a surgical operation restored some but not all of his hearing and fluency.[10][11]
Tramuto attended Wadhams Hall Seminary-College from 1975 to 1979, graduating with a B.A. degree in philosophy. He then studied healthcare marketing at the State University of New York–Buffalo for two years.[12][13]
Business career[edit]
Tramuto taught for a semester at Gannon, a Roman Catholic diocesan university, before making a career change to pharmaceutical marketing at Marion Laboratories.[14]
From 1982 to 1990 Tramuto worked at Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, becoming district manager. He then was hired by Caremark as its vice president for Disease Management Marketing and general manager of its Home Healthcare business unit.[15] He spent four years advocating and directing the development of the company's first AIDS management program.[16]
In 1998 Tramuto co-founded Protocare, Inc., a drug development firm with a healthcare-services consulting division.[15] In 2002 he sold one part to Radiant Research and the other to Constella Health Strategies, which was integrated into UnitedHealth Group a year later.[13][17]
In 2008 Tramuto left UnitedHealth Group and founded Physicians Interactive Holdings, which provided mobile and Web-based medical reference tools, electronic drug sampling, and interactive education to the healthcare industry. Venture capital was supplied by Perseus, a private equity firm.[18] The company's proprietary technology could be used to transmit a patient's medical data to a physician through a handheld device. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, physicians there used it to communicate with medical experts in the U.S.[19]
In 2013 Perseus sold the company to Merck, with Tramuto remaining in place as CEO.[18]
In May 2013 Tramuto was elected to serve as an outside director of health-and-wellness company Healthways Inc.; its shareholders had voted to declassify its staggered board of directors after the New York State Common Retirement Fund claimed that the directors had entrenched themselves.[20] He was appointed chairman a year later.[21] In 2015 the company announced his appointment as president and CEO,[6][15] passing over a corporate officer who had applied for the job.[22]
In July 2016 Tramuto sold Healthways' unprofitable population-health business, along with its brand name, to allow the company to focus on its fitness and rehabilitation programs, under a new name ("Tivity Health").[7][8]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, Tramuto established a nonprofit, Health eVillages, to distribute handheld devices loaded with medical reference materials to healthcare workers in remote regions of the world.[23] In 2014 the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights gave him an RFK Ripple of Hope award for his charitable work in the global healthcare field.[1][4]
In 2016 Tramuto wrote a memoir about obstacles he had encountered in early life and traumatic events that had caused him to feel survivor guilt; he said that these experiences ("life's bulldozer moments") motivated him to succeed in business and do charitable work.[24]
Political activities[edit]
Tramuto was elected to the Town of Ogunquit's Board of Selectmen in 2006 on a write-in campaign. He served two three-year terms. While chairman (2007–12), he represented the town to the governor of Maine on issues related to education and health.[14][25] In 2010 the governor appointed him to the State of Maine Economic Growth Council, which develops and evaluates the state's long-term economic growth plan.[19][26]

Innovator Spotlight: Donato Tramuto | HITLAB







































































                      
                        Innovator Spotlight: Donato Tramuto
                      
                    



October 18, 2016

by Yvonne Bokhour, M.A.













Have you ever wondered where passionate health advocates derive their dedication? Often, they’re inspired by personal experiences.Determined to improve global health, Donato Tramuto is not only passionate, he’s filled with boundless energy and visionary insights, immersed in numerous, impactful initiatives. Of special note, he founded Health e-Villages, a not-for-profit that provides mobile medical diagnostic and treatment information for healthcare professionals in the world’s most underserved areas. He’s also CEO of Healthways, a publicly-traded healthcare company focused on targeted population health for those 50 and over. What drives Tramuto? In a candid interview, he described a series of events that might deplete the average person but, in his case, led to impressive achievements.

At age seven, he lost a significant portion of his hearing, which also impacted his ability to speak. Several years and five surgeries later, his hearing was partially restored but, at the same time, his sister-in-law died in childbirth at age 27 due to a medication error. His brother also died in a car accident.“All those things really engulfed me for a period of time,” he explained, directing him to a path of exploration. At first, he entered the Roman Catholic seminary but, during his stay, discovered an interest in healthcare. He learned everything he could on the subject and, by the 1990s, had become an innovator, bringing technology and data together by launching, as a co-founder, his first company, Protocare, Inc. (now Constella Health Strategies).He then had a realization: when you’ve aggregated data, as Protocare did, you need a platform to deliver that data. So he spent several years developing Physicians Interactive Holdings.Tramuto took his realization a step further, noting “it wasn’t about innovation, it was about integration.” In other words, “there had already been enough innovation going on; what I needed to do was to integrate it.” Physicians Interactive was launched in 2008 with this goal in mind. Now known as Aptus Health, the company is advancing health engagement to transform healthcare models.Even as Tramuto enjoyed these professional successes, he continued to face personal challenges. In 1995 he required another surgery but this operation did not have a successful outcome. He lived for two years with chronic otitis media, preventing the use of hearing aids. After finally locating a doctor who could solve the debilitating issue, he chose not to sue his original provider, but rather to encourage collaboration between the two physicians. This motivated him to promote social media as a powerful agent of connection and education.“And then, of course, in 2001, my world literally came to a screeching halt.” On September 11 of that infamous year, Tramuto was scheduled to take Flight 175—the second plane to hit the World Trade Center. A last-minute decision to change his flight saved his life, but he lost two close friends together with their three-year old son. He established the Tramuto Foundation in their memory, which aims “to make resources available to individuals and communities in need through collaborative partnerships.”He’s “devoted the last 15 years of my life to philanthropic initiatives, which is not only the launch of my private foundation, but the launch of Health e-Villages…an international organization providing healthcare technology to the disadvantaged and to emerging countries.”During our talk, Tramuto returned again and again to the notion integration, as opposed to innovation, is key. “There are more than 100,000 health care apps out there right now,” he said. “Less than 10% are fully utilized, and it’s because innovators develop for who they know and what they know and integrators get right into the mindset of who’s going to use the product.”He mentioned Health e-Villages’ work in emerging countries as an example. “It’s not going in there and innovating something new, it’s basically taking what we have and integrating it with other apps and other programs.”Lwala, a small community in East Africa, was plagued in 2012 with an exceptionally high infant mortality rate—100 deaths per 1000 births. Bringing in doctors and nurses was not a realistic solution. Health e-Villages decided the villagers could be trained to use a medical app (“just because you’re poor doesn’t mean you’re not smart”). Eighty-five villagers were told “how to turn the tablet on, and how to use the medical app for pregnancy-related conditions.”Tramuto noted with pride, “Today we have lowered infant mortality from 100 deaths per 1000 births…to 30. Seventy more babies are alive today because we integrated what we had. We had trust in the people, who are in fact as smart as we are. They’d just never been given the chance.”His passion was palpable. “In our lifetime, one billion people will go to their graves prematurely because they never had access to a healthcare worker.” He went on, “Some people will say, well, just educate more physicians. But in Ethiopia, a country of 100 million people, the physician per population ratio is one per 48,000. You can’t educate enough physicians in our lifetime to take care of that problem.”He believes “the go-forward resolution is to integrate the technology that is there, to rely on technology that can be used by local villagers to empower individuals.” Case-in-point: India, a population of 1.2 billion people; 45% don’t have toilets, but 65% have mobile phones.Even in the United States, we have the technology, but we have to work together. “I think the number one problem in healthcare is not cost nor quality. I think it’s trust.” He said the more we can “increase our collaborative integration, the more we will get done.”We need to focus on outcomes, which are “more than just cost, and more than just quality…you have to look at the consumer as being educated, and not look at the consumer in terms of trying to make their decision for them.” He also doesn’t think consumers should be told, “get engaged.” People get engaged when they’re sick. “You have to recognize they want to be empowered.” Negative incentives do not encourage empowerment. Consumers have to “feel they are a part of the solution.” Involvement in wellness and prevention early on will improve not only outcomes but overall well-being.This involves a cultural shift. Currently, “we’re caught between the challenge of managing chronic diseases to meet…the responsibilities that companies have in terms of their public trading status” and moving toward well-being. For Tramuto, healthcare should currently be viewed as a “turnaround” demanding both transformative and transactional leadership. He explained it’s important to demonstrate transformative leadership that is not all about transactions—a shift that will take time. “You’ve got to get the content right, you’ve got to get the culture right, you’ve got to get the people to believe in you, and then you’ve got to implement the strategy.”Consumers are better educated than ever before, partially thanks to their smartphones. Knowing this, pharmaceutical companies, as but one example, need to better explain their intentions. “We are not focused on whether or not you’re going to take the drug. We’re focused on making the right decisions for the right patient in the right environment for the right outcome.”  He believes the tide is changing, moving toward patient empowerment, although not overnight. “We’ve got to quit thinking that we can make the decisions for the patient. The patient is a consumer and the consumer is well-educated.” He knows this will take time, but smartphones and currently available technologies are “our greatest movement.” Tramuto said, “If, in Africa, we can train villagers on how to turn a tablet on…to make decisions about a pregnant woman, then I think here…we can move the needle a lot quicker, by putting our egos aside and collaborating.”All who have had the opportunity to collaborate with Donato Tramuto are no doubt in awe and energized by his amazing work. We’re looking forward to his ongoing humanitarian efforts (with help from digital health technology!).He ended our discussion with this inspiring quote from Horace Mann, “Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.”

Tramuto, founder, CEO and chairman of Physicians Interactive, has nearly 35 years of healthcare experience in both the product and service segments. He was previously CEO of i3, a global pharmaceutical services company, formerly part of Ingenix (a UnitedHealthGroup Company), overseeing the clinical research, pharmaceutical data, analytics, outcomes, EPI/safety, CME, health education and strategic consulting business units.
Prior to joining UnitedHealth Group, Tramuto was one of the founders of Protocare, Inc., a large provider of drug development and disease management services, where he served as chief executive and president of the protocare sciences division and corporate officer of Protocare from 1998 to its successful sale in 2003. Prior to co-founding Protocare, Tramuto was general manager/president of the Home Health Care Business and corporate vice president of marketing at Caremark, where he championed the development of the company’s national disease management program for HIV/AIDS. He started his healthcare career at Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals.
Tramuto is also the chairman and founder of the Tramuto Foundation, a non-profit organization that he created in 2001 to help young individuals achieve their educational goals and has also supported more than 40 organizations worldwide in helping the disadvantaged of our land. In 2011 and following the devastating effects from the earthquake in Haiti, he founded Health eVillages, a program now residing at the not-for-profit Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights and funded through Physicians Interactive, which provides state-of-the-art mobile health technology, including medical reference and clinical decision support resources to medical professionals in the most challenging clinical environments around the world. Through his leadership efforts, infant mortality in the village of Lwala (East Africa) has declined from 100 to 35 deaths per one thousand births.He serves on several executive leadership boards: The Boston University School of Public Health Dean’s advisory board, chairman of the Physicians Interactive board of directors, the Robert F. Kennedy US Leadership Council, chairman of the board of Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights Europe, chairman of the HealthWays board of directors, and the Maine Economic Council, a four-year appointment by former Governor John Baldacci. He previously served on the Duke University Fuqua Health Care advisory board, as well as on the Regis College board of trustees.
In 2005, 2009 and 2012, Tramuto was selected by PharmaVOICE as one of the Top 100 most inspirational healthcare leaders in the life sciences industry. In May 2012, he was recognized by The Boston Globe as one of the Top 12 Innovators in Massachusetts for his work on Health eVillages. In 2013, he received the Healthcare IT News H.I.T. Men & Woman Award in the Innovators category. In August of 2014, he was honored with the PharmaVOICE Red Jacket Award presented to individuals who throughout their career have demonstrated a commitment to furthering the life sciences industry through leadership, innovation, motivation, mentorship and philanthropy.
Tramuto was recently selected as one of four distinguished recipients of the 2014 Ripple of Hope Award from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights alongside former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro and Grammy Award winner Tony Bennett. The award lauds leaders of the international entertainment and activist communities who demonstrate commitment to social change.
