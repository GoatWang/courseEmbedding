About Us
Data Collective (DCVC) is a venture capital fund that backs entrepreneurs applying deep tech to transform giant industries. DCVC and its principals have supported brilliant people changing global-scale businesses for over twenty years, helping create tens of billions of dollars of wealth while also making the world a markedly better place.
                           
DCVC brings to bear a unique model that unites a team of experienced venture capitalists with more than 50 technology executives and experts (CTOs, CIOs, Chief Scientists, Principal Engineers, Professors at Stanford, Berkeley, and major technical universities) with significant tenures at top 100 technology companies and research institutions worldwide.
                            
DCVC focuses on Seed and Series A companies, and growth stage opportunities within its own portfolio.
                            
DCVC’s strong network, operational experience and technical background delivers unique value to entrepreneurs. We still read code. We understand chip architecture and when to run BLAST versus Bowtie. We've built supercompute racks ourselves, and we know that degrees of freedom doesn’t mean how often a robot escapes. We know that PyTorch isn’t something you use to make crème brulee. And we will be there at 3 am to cheer the new build or at 7 am to help land that new customer.

Chris Boshuizen
Entrepreneur in Residence
Chris was co-founder of Planet Labs, a DCVC company providing unprecedented daily, global mapping of our changing planet from space. As the company’s CTO for 5 years, he took the company from the drawing board to having launched more satellites into space than any other company in history, completely transforming the space industry along the way.
Chris was previously a Space Mission Architect at NASA Ames Research Center.  After working on a number of traditional spacecraft programs at NASA, Chris co-created Phonesat, a spacecraft built solely out of a regular smart phone. The cost was so low, and the concept so simple, that space exploration is now within grasp of the everyday person, and many other groups around the world are pursuing their own low-cost space programs as a consequence.
While at NASA, Chris also established Singularity University, a school for studying the consequences of accelerating technological development.  Initially fulfilling the role of Interim Director, Chris helped raise over $2.5 million to establish the university, assembled the faculty, and served as co-chair for the University’s Department of Space and Sciences.
Chris received his Ph.D. in Physics (with honors) and BSc. in Physics and Mathematics, both from the University of Sydney.

					Algorithm that uses fine-grained sub-analysis to determine whether to go long or short on the E-Mini SPX future.
				



Hypothetical









SPXTrends Futures

						How SPXTrend future works?.  In a sense, there are two kinds of decisions being made — the first is a more macro analysis of the regime and the market. Once that has been determined, the algorithm uses fine-grained sub-analysis to determine whether to go long or short on the E-Mini SPX future. The system will trade 1 or 2 units on at a time, it´s a strategy that has been consistent over the years, and across several types of markets — bullish, bearish, meandering. I regard stop-losses as essential.

About the results you see on this Web site

	Past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.


	These results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations. 
	Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. 
	Also, because these trades have not actually been executed, these results may have 
    under-or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. 
    Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are 
    also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being
    made that any account will or is likely to achieve
    profits or losses similar to these being shown.


	In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely
	account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere
	to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect 
	actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation
	of any specific trading program, which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance
	results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.


	You may be interested to learn more technical details about 
	how Collective2 calculates the hypothetical results you see on this web site.

Substantial risk of loss. There is a substantial risk of loss in futures and forex trading. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. You should read, understand, and consider the Risk Disclosure Statement that is provided by your broker before you consider trading.
Online trading is risky. The risk of loss in online trading of stocks, options, and foreign equities is substantial.
