Aaron Hernandez meets with Casey Anthony's lawyer




WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Casey Anthony knows that much of the world believes she killed her 2-year-old daughter, despite her acquittal. But nearly nine years later, she insists she doesn’t know how the last hours of Caylee’s life unfolded.
“Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass,” she told the Associated Press in one of a series of exclusive interviews.
But discussing Caylee’s last moments, the 30-year-old Anthony spoke in halting, sober tones: “I’m still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened,” she said.
“Based off what was in the media” — the story of a woman who could not account for a month in which her child was missing, whose defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony — “I understand the reasons people feel about me. I understand why people have the opinions that they do.”
This was the first time Anthony spoke to a news media outlet about her daughter’s death or her years since the trial. Her responses were at turns revealing, bizarre and often contradictory, and they ultimately raised more questions than answers about the case that has captivated the nation.
It’s been almost nine years since Caylee went missing, and six since the circus-like Orlando trial that ended in her mother’s acquittal. The trial was carried live on cable networks and was the focus of daily commentaries by HLN’s Nancy Grace, who called her “the most hated mom in America,” and, derisively, “Tot Mom.”
The child was supposedly last seen on June 16, 2008; she was first reported missing, by Casey Anthony’s mother, on July 15. A day later, Casey Anthony was arrested on charges of child neglect. She told police that Caylee had disappeared with a baby sitter.
A utility worker working in a wooded area near the Anthony home on Dec. 11 found skeletal remains that were later determined to be Caylee’s. Experts would testify that air samples indicated that decaying human remains had been present in Casey Anthony’s trunk.

In the end, prosecutors proved Casey Anthony was a liar, but convinced the jury of little else. The government failed to establish how Caylee died, and they couldn’t find her mother’s DNA on the duct tape they said was used to suffocate her. After a trial of a month-and-a-half, the jury took less than 11 hours to find Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter and aggravated child abuse.
She was convicted of four counts of lying to police (though two counts were later dropped), and served about three years in prison while awaiting trial.
She admits that she lied to police: about being employed at Universal Studios; about leaving Caylee with a baby sitter; about telling two people, both of them imaginary, that Caylee was missing; about receiving a phone call from Caylee the day before she was reported missing.
“Even if I would’ve told them everything that I told to the psychologist, I hate to say this but I firmly believe I would have been in the same place. Because cops believe other cops. Cops tend to victimize the victims. I understand now … I see why I was treated the way I was even had I been completely truthful.”
At the trial, lead defense attorney Jose Baez suggested that the little girl drowned and that Casey’s father, George Anthony, helped cover that up — and sexually abused his daughter. Her father has vehemently denied the accusations.
Asked about the drowning defense, Casey hesitated: “Everyone has their theories, I don’t know. As I stand here today, I can’t tell you one way or another. The last time I saw my daughter, I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that’s what was told to me. ”
AP
Anthony lives in the South Florida home of Patrick McKenna, a private detective who was the lead investigator on her defense team.
She also works for him, doing online social media searches and other investigative work. McKenna was also the lead investigator for OJ Simpson, when he was accused of killing his wife and acquitted; Anthony said she’s become fascinated with the case, and there are “a lot of parallels” to her own circumstances.
An Associated Press reporter met Anthony as she protested against President Donald Trump at a Palm Beach rally.
It’s unclear why Anthony agreed to speak to the AP. She later texted the reporter, asking that the AP not run the story. Among other things, she cited the bankruptcy case in which she has been embroiled since 2013: “During the course of my bankruptcy, the rights to my story were purchased by a third party company for $25k to protect my interests. Without written authorization from the controlling members of this company, I am prohibited from speaking publicly about my case at any time.”
In addition, she said she had violated a confidentiality agreement with her employer, and remains under subpoena and subject to deposition in her bankruptcy case.

Yet she had participated in five on-the-record interviews over a one-week period, many of them audiotaped.
She still dreads the supermarket checkout line for fear she’ll see photos of her daughter on the cover of tabloid papers. Her bedroom walls are decorated with photos of Caylee and she weeps when she shows off her daughter’s colorful, fingerpainted artwork.
Occasionally she goes out with friends to area bars. But news that she is there spreads quickly; people whisper and snap photos, and she retreats to her newly purchased SUV so she can return home, alone.
Anthony speaks defiantly of her pariah status.
“I don’t give a s— about what anyone thinks about me, I never will,” she said. “I’m OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night.”

 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Casey Anthony knows that much of the world believes she killed her 2-year-old daughter, despite her acquittal. But nearly nine years later, she insists she doesn't know how the last hours of Caylee's life unfolded.

 "Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass," she told The Associated Press in one of a series of exclusive interviews. "I'd like to think she'd be listening to classic rock, playing sports" and putting up with no nonsense. 
 But discussing Caylee's last moments, the 30-year-old Anthony spoke in halting, sober tones: "I'm still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened," she said. 
 "Based off what was in the media" — the story of a woman who could not account for a month in which her child was missing, whose defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony — "I understand the reasons people feel about me. I understand why people have the opinions that they do." 

“I don't give a s*** about what anyone thinks about me, I never will”

 This was the first time Anthony spoke to a news media outlet about her daughter's death or her years since the trial. Her responses were at turns revealing, bizarre and often contradictory, and they ultimately raised more questions than answers about the case that has captivated the nation. 
 It's been almost nine years since Caylee went missing, and six since the circus-like Orlando trial that ended in her mother's acquittal. The trial was carried live on cable networks and was the focus of daily commentaries by HLN's Nancy Grace, who called her "the most hated mom in America," and, derisively, "tot mom." 
 "People found me guilty long before I had my day in court," Anthony said.

 The child was supposedly last seen on June 16, 2008; she was first reported missing, by Casey Anthony's mother, on July 15. A day later, Casey Anthony was arrested on charges of child neglect. She told police that Caylee had disappeared with a baby sitter.

 Still, the Florida Department of Children and Families concluded that Anthony was responsible for her daughter's death because her "actions or the lack of actions ... ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child." And just this month, former Circuit Judge Belvin Perry Jr., who presided at the trial, theorized that Anthony may have killed Caylee accidentally when she was using chloroform to calm her.

 She was convicted of four counts of lying to police (though two counts were later dropped), and served about three years in prison while awaiting trial. A thousand people were there to see her released. 
 She admits that she lied to police: about being employed at Universal Studios; about leaving Caylee with a baby-sitter; about telling two people, both of them imaginary, that Caylee was missing; about receiving a phone call from Caylee the day before she was reported missing. 
 "Even if I would've told them everything that I told to the psychologist, I hate to say this but I firmly believe I would have been in the same place. Because cops believe other cops. Cops tend to victimize the victims. I understand now ... I see why I was treated the way I was even had I been completely truthful." 
 She added: "Cops lie to people every day. I'm just one of the unfortunate idiots who admitted they lied." 
 She paused. 
 "My dad was a cop, you can read into that what you want to." 
 At the trial, lead defense attorney Jose Baez suggested that the little girl drowned and that Casey Anthony's father, George, helped cover that up — and sexually abused his daughter. Her father has vehemently denied the accusations.

 Anthony doesn't talk about her parents much, other than to say she was disappointed when they took money from television's Dr. Phil and appeared on his show. The host donated $600,000 to Caylee's Fund, a nonprofit started by Anthony's parents. At the time, he said George and Cindy Anthony would derive no income from the money. The nonprofit was later dissolved. 
 Asked about the drowning defense, Casey Anthony hesitated: "Everyone has their theories, I don't know. As I stand here today I can't tell you one way or another. The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that's what was told to me. "

 "I can empathize with his situation," she said. 
 She still dreads the supermarket checkout line for fear she'll see photos of her daughter on the cover of tabloid papers. Her bedroom walls are decorated with photos of Caylee and she weeps when she shows off her daughter's colorful, finger-painted artwork. 
 Still, she asserts she is happy. For her 31st birthday she plans to go skydiving. She enjoys taking photos, mostly of squirrels and other wildlife. And she loves her investigative work. 
 Anthony speaks defiantly of her pariah status. 
 "I don't give a s*** about what anyone thinks about me, I never will," she said. "I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night."

    Casey Anthony knows that much of the world believes she killed her 2-year-old daughter, despite her acquittal. Nearly nine years later, Anthony insists in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press she doesn’t know what happened to Caylee. (March 7)

            COMMENTEMAILMORECasey Anthony, the Florida woman at the center of a 2011 murder case involving her daughter, spoke about the case and her daughter’s death for the first time in an interview with the Associated Press. “I’m still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened,” Anthony told the AP.Anthony was accused of killing her daughter Caylee Anthony in June 2008. Caylee's body was found months later in the woods near the Anthony home, but authorities were unable to determine a cause of death. The prosecution team said Anthony dumped Caylee's body there and tried to resume her normal life.The AP reported that the interview with Anthony was “revealing, bizarre and often contradictory, and … ultimately raised more questions than answers about the case.”In the interview, Anthony acknowledged the frenzy surrounding her case led many to view her negatively.“Based off of what was in the media, I understand the reasons people feel about me,” Anthony said. “I understand why people have the opinions that they do.”More coverage:Where is Casey Anthony now?Casey Anthony probably killed her daughter, but by accident, judge saysIn 2011, a jury acquitted Anthony of murdering her two-year-old child. Instead, the jury convicted her of four misdemeanor counts of lying to police.Anthony admitted to the AP that she lied to police about a slew of things, including her employment, leaving her child with a babysitter, and about receiving a call from Caylee before she went missing.“Even if I would’ve told them everything that I told to the psychologist, I hate to say this, but I firmly believe I would have been in the same place,” she told AP. “Because cops believe other cops. Cops tend to victimize the victims. I understand now … I see why I was treated the way I was even had I been completely truthful.”FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInCasey Anthony through the years FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The photo shows Caylee Anthony and her mother Casey. An expert witness used this photo to superimpose an image of Caylee's skull to mark where duct tape found on the remains would have been positioned on the child when she was alive.

As I stand here today I can’t tell you one way or another,” she said. “The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that’s what was told to me.”And there are no shortage of theories surrounding Caylee’s death. Last week, the retired Florida judge who presided over the Anthony trial told WFTV that he believes Anthony accidentally killed her daughter with chloroform. During the trial, evidence was presented that showed Anthony researched using chloroform, which was once used as an inhaled anesthetic during surgery.“The most logical thing that occurred, in my eyesight, based on everything I know about the case, was that (Anthony) did not intentionally kill her daughter,” Perry told WFTV. “I think based upon the evidence, the most logical thing that happened was that she tried to knock her daughter out by the use of chloroform and gave her too much chloroform, which caused her daughter to die.”Anthony, who currently lives at the house of a private investigator who worked on her case, told AP she is currently helping him with some investigative work.And despite the fact she can hardly go anywhere without news of her presence spreading, she told the AP she's happy.“I don’t give a sh** about what anyone thinks about me, I never will,” she told AP. “I’m OK with myself; I sleep pretty good at night.”The interview with Anthony was based on a series of interviews with an AP reporter.

                                        (Newser)
                                    –
                                        Almost nine years after her 2-year-old daughter Caylee's death—and six years after she was controversially acquitted of murder and child abuse—Casey Anthony has broken her silence about the girl's death in an interview with the AP. "I'm still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened," the 30-year-old says in an interview that the AP says contained "revealing, bizarre, and often contradictory answers" that raised more questions than answers about Caylee's death. Some highlights:   "Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass," Anthony says. "I'd like to think she'd be listening to classic rock, playing sports," and taking no nonsense, she says. 

  Anthony, once labeled the "most hated mom in America," says she knows many people still think she killed Caylee. "Based off what was in the media"—the story of a woman who could not account for a month in which her child was missing, and whose defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony—"I understand the reasons people feel about me. I understand why people have the opinions that they do," Anthony says.  Anthony sees herself as Alice in Wonderland, with the public as the Red Queen. "The queen is proclaiming: 'No, no, sentence first, verdict afterward,'" she says. "I sense and feel to this day that is a direct parallel to what I lived. My sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict. Sentence first, verdict afterward. People found me guilty long before I had my day in court."  On her drowning defense, Anthony says: "Everyone has their theories, I don't know. As I stand here today I can't tell you one way or another. The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that's what was told to me."  Anthony admits lying to police about details, including leaving Caylee with a babysitter and telling two people the girl was missing, but she believes she would have ended up on trial even if she told the truth. "Because cops believe other cops. Cops tend to victimize the victims," she says, adding: "Cops lie to people every day. I'm just one of the unfortunate idiots who admitted they lied."  Anthony lives in the home of a private investigator who worked on her case and employs her to do investigative work. She says she plans to go skydiving for her 31st birthday—and is happy, despite her pariah status. "I don't give a s--- about what anyone thinks about me, I never will," she says. "I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night."  The interview was one of a series that Anthony granted to an AP reporter she encountered at an anti-President Trump rally in Palm Beach, Fla. She later asked the reporter not to run the story, citing, among other things, the fact that the rights to her story had been sold to a third party during bankruptcy proceedings in 2013, prohibiting her from speaking publicly about the case. (The judge who presided over Anthony's murder trial thinks he knows what really happened.)

                    Karma always solves these things.  Sometimes it takes longer to brew but it always steeps its justice in its own way on its own terms.  From what I read between the lines, this lady is tormented with the horrors she committed.  If you put on a fake public face that makes it look like you are enjoying your life and don't care, then most likely you are privately serving a life sentence in the depths of hell within your own mind.

                    I think her grandad raped her and then drowned her. Casey is covering for her abusive father, IMO.
