 We seek to own shares of companies that are trading at substantial discounts to their intrinsic value. Purchasing securities at discounts to intrinsic value should create a margin of safety and allow for uncommon return generation. We believe that the greater the discount, the greater the potential for investment return.







 While attractive valuation is the most important thing, it is not the only thing we require in an investment.  We will only invest in quality companies.  We seek businesses that we believe will generate attractive returns on their invested capital. We seek resilient businesses, those with reasonable debt levels, positive growth, attractive margins, competent management, and the flexibility to react to all phases of the business cycle.  Our quality discipline leads us to avoid deeply cyclical companies, basic materials and commodities, and regulated utilities.





 We will only invest in companies we can thoroughly analyze and understand.  Certain businesses do not lend themselves to fundamental analysis, either because of complexity or opacity. Examples include banks, pharmaceuticals, biotech and high tech.  We avoid such businesses by design. We believe that the better one can analyze a company, the more likely one is to be right.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Lyrical Asset Management's U.S. Value Equity Strategy Attains Three-Year Track Record

Jan 06, 2012, 09:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Lyrical Asset Management, LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Jan. 6, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Lyrical Asset Management, LP (LAM), a registered investment advisor, announced today that its U.S. Value Equity strategy attained a three-year performance track record as of December 31, 2011.  The U.S. Value Equity portfolio management team is led by LAM's Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Wellington, and includes Associate Portfolio Manager and 14-year industry veteran, Caroline Ritter.
"Since inception, LAM has employed a deep value, high quality discipline that is demonstrably unique within the traditional equity arena," said Andrew Wellington.  "As an emerging, boutique firm, LAM is committed to maximizing long-term investment results and to staying style pure yet benchmark agnostic.  Our clients are finding this to be a refreshing alternative to the mass of benchmark-hugging funds that dominate the industry."
Since January 1, 2009, LAM's U.S. Value Equity strategy returned 102%, net of fees, outperforming the Russell 1000 Value benchmark by 14.9% per annum and placing the strategy in the top ranks of its category.  U.S. Value Equity invests in 30-40 large- and mid-cap companies, diversified by industry but concentrated enough to drive differentiated performance.  For 2009, Pensions & Investments recognized LAM as one of the "Top 10 Managers" in the US Value category.
About Lyrical Partners, LP
Lyrical Partners was founded in 2004 by Jeff Keswin, co-founder and former co-President of Greenlight Capital.  Lyrical is a New York-based boutique value-driven investment firm that along with its affiliates manages funds of hedge funds, multi-family housing real estate funds, and public equity portfolios.  The firm's strategies have received numerous awards from major industry publications.
THIS IS NOT AN OFFERING OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO INVEST IN THE STRATEGY PRESENTED. ANY SUCH OFFERING CAN ONLY BE MADE FOLLOWING A ONE-ON-ONE PRESENTATION, AND ONLY TO QUALIFIED INVESTORS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW.
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE STRATEGY WILL BE ACHIEVED. RISKS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THIS STRATEGY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY, AND IN A VALUE INVESTING APPROACH, MORE SPECIFICALLY. MOREOVER, PAST PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.
THE U.S. VALUE EQUITY TRACK RECORD REFERRED TO HEREIN COMMENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING LAM'S ACCEPTANCE OF ITS INITIAL FEE PAYING INVESTOR.  
THE RUSSELL 1000 VALUE INDEX MEASURES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LARGE-CAP VALUE SEGMENT OF THE U.S. EQUITY UNIVERSE. IT INCLUDES THOSE RUSSELL 1000 COMPANIES WITH LOWER PRICE-TO-BOOK RATIOS AND LOWER EXPECTED GROWTH VALUES. THE RUSSELL 1000 VALUE INDEX IS CONSTRUCTED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE AND UNBIASED BAROMETER FOR THE LARGE-CAP VALUE SEGMENT. THE INDEX IS COMPLETELY RECONSTITUTED ANNUALLY TO ENSURE NEW AND GROWING EQUITIES ARE INCLUDED AND THAT THE REPRESENTED COMPANIES CONTINUE TO REFLECT VALUE CHARACTERISTICS.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
