 LINEAR
TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION

ROBERT H. SWANSON, JR.
FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT
 

This Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Fourth
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the
“Agreement”) is entered into
as of April 16, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) by
and between Linear Technology Corporation (the
“Company”) and Robert H. Swanson, Jr.
(“Executive”).

WHEREAS, Executive and the Company
executed the Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Employment Agreement in January
2002 (the “Initial Employment Agreement”);

WHEREAS, Executive has since
resigned from his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, but at the request of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the “Board”) pursuant to Section 3(f) of the
Initial Employment Agreement, has agreed to remain Executive
Chairman of the Board;

WHEREAS, Executive and the Company
executed the Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Amended and Restated Employment
Agreement on October 18, 2005 (the “Amended Employment
Agreement”);

WHEREAS, Executive and the Company
executed the Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Second Amended and Restated
Employment Agreement on November 5, 2008 (the “Second Amended
Employment Agreement”);

WHEREAS, Executive and the Company
executed the Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Third Amended and Restated
Employment Agreement on December 18, 2012 (the “Third Amended
Employment Agreement”); and

WHEREAS, Executive and the Company
desire to revise the Third Amended Employment Agreement to redress
certain unintended negative incentives in such agreement for the
Executive to resign from the Company by providing him with certain
severance benefits in the event of a termination of his service due
to his death or Disability (as defined below).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises and
intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as
follows:






1. Duties and Scope of Employment
.









(a) Positions; Agreement Commencement Date;
Duties .  Following the
Effective Date, Executive shall continue to serve as Executive
Chairman of the Board, reporting to the Board.  The
period of Executive’s employment hereunder is referred to
herein as the “Employment Term.”  Subject to
the provisions of Section 2, Executive and the Company anticipate
that the Employment Term shall run for an indefinite time, but at
least through the foreseeable future.  For purposes of
clarification, however, regardless of when the Employment Term ends
after the date of this Fourth Amended and Restated Employment
Agreement, Executive shall be eligible to receive the severance
benefits contained herein, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.  During the Employment Term, Executive
shall render such business and professional services in the
performance of his duties, consistent with Executive’s
position within the Company, as shall reasonably be assigned to him
by the Board.




 





(b)
Obligations .  During the Employment Term, Executive
shall devote his business efforts and time to the Company two to
three days per week.  Executive agrees, during the
Employment Term, not to actively engage in any other employment,
occupation or consulting activity for any direct or indirect
remuneration without the approval of the Board that would result in
a conflict of interest with the Company’s
business.









2. At-Will Employment .  Executive and the Company understand and
acknowledge that Executive’s employment with the Company
constitutes “at-will” employment.  Subject to
the Company’s obligation to provide severance benefits as
specified herein, Executive and the Company acknowledge that this
employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written
notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or
no cause, at the option either of the Company or
Executive.




 





3.
Compensation .









(a) Base Salary .  While employed by the Company, the
Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for his services
$506,000 (the “Base Salary”), prorated for the number
of full days of service he performs as Executive Chairman of the
Board.  Such salary shall be paid periodically in
accordance with normal Company payroll practices and subject to the
usual, required withholding.  Executive’s Base
Salary shall be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of
the Board (the “Committee”) for possible adjustments in
light of Executive’s performance and competitive
data.




 





(b)
Bonuses .  Executive shall be eligible to earn a
bonus under the Company’s 1996 Senior Executive Bonus Plan as
specified by the Committee and will also be eligible to participate
in the Key Employee Incentive Bonus Plan or any successor bonus
plans to such plans (collectively, the “Bonus
Plans”). 






 



 


 







(i) Executive’s target bonus (the “Target
Bonus”) for any six-month period will be his target bonus for
the previous six-month period increased or decreased by the same
percentage the total bonus pool for the Bonus Plans for the
six-month period in question increased or decreased compared to the
previous six-month period.  By way of example only, if
Executive’s Target Bonus for the first six-month period of a
particular year is $1,000,000 and the total bonus pool for the
Bonus Plans for the second six-month period of such year increases
by 10% over the total bonus pool for the Bonus Plans for the first
six-month period of such year, then Executive’s Target Bonus
for second six-month period would be
$1,100,000. 









(ii)
Executive’s actual bonus for any particular
period will equal the actual bonus to which he would have otherwise
been entitled for such period based upon the Target Bonus prorated
for the number of full days of service he performs for the Company
as Executive Chairman of the Board during such period, or
alternatively in such lesser amount as the Committee deems
appropriate, but in no event more than 50% of the Target Bonus for
any relevant period.  By way of example only, if the
actual bonus Executive would have been entitled to for a period if
he had worked full time was the Target Bonus of $1,000,000, then
(A) if the number of full days of service Executive performed
during the period was 30% of full time, his actual bonus would be
$300,000, and (B) if the number of full days of service Executive
performed during the period was 60% of full time, then his actual
bonus would be $500,000.




 





(iii)
Any such
bonus will be paid promptly following the determination of whether
and to what extent that it has been earned, but in no event after
the later of (i) March 15 of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which such determination is made and no longer
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or (ii) two and
one-half months following the end of the fiscal year of the Company
in which such determination is made and no longer subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture.









(c) Benefits . 
During the Employment Term, Executive shall be eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by the Company
that are applicable to other senior management to the full extent
provided for under those plans, including health and other welfare
plan participation, use of the Company airplane and pilot(s) as set
forth in Section 3(d) hereof, office space and secretary, but
excluding participation in any Company employee stock purchase plan
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as it has been and
may be amended from time to time), and any Company 401(k) plan and
any benefits and perquisites where continuing Executive’s
participation would be either (i) contrary to statute or
regulation, or (ii) highly impractical.




 





(d)
Use of
Company Airplane .  During the Employment Term, Executive
shall be permitted to use, for personal purposes, the Company
airplane and pilot(s), for up to 35% of the available flight time
in any year; provided, however, that such use shall be subject to
the Company’s reasonable policies and airplane usage
requirements.  Executive shall be fully grossed-up for
any imputed taxable income recognized by virtue of such use so that
the net effect to Executive is the same as if there was no imputed
income.  Executive will receive such payments no later
than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which Executive remits the applicable taxes to the relevant tax
authorities.









(e)
Severance Prior to a Change of Control
.




 





(i) Voluntary Termination for Good Reason; Involuntary
Termination Other Than for Cause .  If, prior to a Change of Control (as
defined herein), Executive’s tenure as Executive Chairman of
the Board, terminates due to (i) a voluntary termination for
“Good Reason” (as defined herein) where the grounds for
the Good Reason are not cured by the Company within 30 days
following receipt of written notice specifying the grounds from
Executive, or (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company
other than for “Cause” (as defined herein), then,
subject to Section 5, and subject to Executive executing and not
revoking a standard form of mutual release of claims with the
Company, which the Company shall provide to Executive no later than
five (5) business days after the termination date  (the
“Release”), and provided that the Release becomes
effective and irrevocable no later than sixty (60) days following
the termination date (such deadline, the “Release
Deadline”), and subject to Executive not breaching the terms
of Section 12 hereof:









(1) all of
Executive’s Company   stock options (together with other rights to
purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock
(including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall
immediately accelerate vesting as to 100% of the then unvested
amount of such award;




 





(2)
Executive
shall receive continued payments of severance pay for 12 months
following the date of such termination at a rate equal
to:









a) Executive’s annual Base Salary at the rate in
effect on the date of such termination, plus




 





b)
two times
the average of his Target Bonus (without respect to any proration
for actual days of service performed or the 50% limitation, each as
referred in Section 3(b)(ii) above) for the four six-month
bonus


 






 


 





periods prior to the
date of such termination, which amount will be payable in equal
installments over such 12-month period (for purposes of clarity, it
is the intention of this paragraph that Executive receive under
this paragraph an amount equal to a full year of (i.e., twice) the
full amount of his average six-month Target Bonuses as if he were
performing his duties as Executive Chairman  full time at
the time of termination; by way of example only, if
Executive’s Target Bonuses (without regard to his actual
bonuses paid) were $1,000,000, $1,200,000, $800,000 and $1,000,000,
respectively, in the four six-month periods prior to the date of
termination, then the average six-month Target Bonus would be
$1,000,000, and the annual bonus payable under this paragraph would
be $2,000,000);





in each case, as if
Executive had been performing services as Executive Chairman of the
Board on a full-time basis up to the date of termination, with no
proration or limitation on the amount of his actual compensation
(e.g., Executive’s bonus would not be prorated or limited to
50% of his Target Bonus for any particular period based upon time
actually worked), less applicable withholding and payable in
accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices (the
“Severance Payment”);






(3) the
Company shall reimburse Executive for premiums paid for continued
health and dental benefits for Executive and his covered dependents
for the lesser of:









a) 18
months from the date of Executive’s termination of
employment, payable when such premiums are due (provided Executive
validly elects to continue coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”),
or




 





b)
the date
upon which Executive and his covered dependents are covered by
similar plans of Executive’s new employer (the “COBRA
Coverage”).





For purposes of this
Agreement, “Cause” shall mean (i) an act of
personal dishonesty taken by Executive in connection with his
responsibilities hereunder and intended to result in substantial
personal enrichment of Executive; (ii) Executive being
convicted of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony;
(iii) a willful act by Executive which constitutes gross
misconduct and which is injurious to the Company; and
(iv) following delivery to Executive of a written demand for
performance from the Company which describes the basis for the
Company’s reasonable belief that Executive has not
substantially performed his duties, continued violations by
Executive of Executive’s obligations to the Company which are
demonstrably willful and deliberate on Executive’s
part.

For purposes of this
Agreement, “Good Reason” means, without
Executive’s express consent, (i) a material reduction of
Executive’s duties, title, authority or responsibilities,
relative to Executive’s duties, title, authority or
responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such reduction,
or the assignment to Executive of such reduced duties, title,
authority or responsibilities; (ii) a material reduction, of
the facilities and perquisites (including office space and
location) available to Executive immediately prior to such
reduction, other than a reduction generally applicable to all
senior management of the Company; (iii) a reduction by the
Company in the Base Salary of Executive as in effect immediately
prior to such reduction; (iv) a material reduction by the
Company in the aggregate level of employee benefits, including
Target Bonuses, to which Executive was entitled immediately prior
to such reduction with the result that Executive’s aggregate
benefits package is materially reduced (other than a reduction that
generally applies to Company employees); (v) the relocation of
Executive to a facility or a location more than 35 miles from
Executive’s then present location); or (vi) any act or
set of facts or circumstances which would, under California case
law or statute constitute a constructive termination of Executive;
provided, however, that Executive agrees that Executive’s
transition from Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
to Chairman pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Initial Employment
Agreement and the related reductions in pay, responsibilities and
the like did not constitute Good Reason.

Executive shall not be
required to mitigate the value of any severance benefits
contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such benefits be
reduced by any earnings or benefits that the Executive may receive
from any other source; provided, however, that if Executive
receives severance benefits hereunder, he expressly waives the
right to receive severance benefits under any other severance plan
or policy of the Company.






(ii) Voluntary Termination Other than for Good Reason;
Involuntary Termination for Cause .  Except as provided otherwise in
Sections 3(g) hereof, in the event Executive terminates his
employment voluntarily other than for Good Reason or is
involuntarily terminated by the Company for Cause, then all vesting
of Executive’s stock options (together with other rights to
purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock
(including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall
terminate immediately and all payments of compensation by the
Company to Executive hereunder shall immediately terminate (except
as to amounts already earned).









(iii)
Timing
of Payments .  Any
severance payments under this Agreement subject to the signing of a
Release shall be paid on (or, in the case of any such payments made
in installments, shall not commence until) the Release Deadline,
or, if later, such time as i

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
