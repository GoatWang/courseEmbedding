Cloudera Inc. is a United States-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.
Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[2]

History[edit]
Three engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook (Christophe Bisciglia, Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) joined with a former Oracle executive (Mike Olson) to form Cloudera in 2008.[3] Olson was the CEO of Sleepycat Software, the creator of the open-source embedded database engine Berkeley DB (acquired by Oracle in 2006). Awadallah was from Yahoo, where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.[4] At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.[5]
Architect Doug Cutting, also a former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, authored the open-source Lucene and Nutch search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009. Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.[6]
In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop in conjunction with a $5 million investment led by Accel Partners.[7] In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from Ignition Partners, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm with open connections to the CIA.[8]
In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at ArcSight when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010.[9] In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for which Intel received 18% share in Cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on Cloudera projects. With additional funds coming from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and an affiliate of MSD Capital, L.P., the private investment firm for Michael S. Dell. and others.[10]
In January 2012 Oracle Corporation announced a partnership with Cloudera for its Oracle Big Data Appliance.[11] In January 2013 Dell announced a partnership with Cloudera.[12] In March 2013 Intel invested $740 million in Cloudera for an 18% investment.[13] In May 2013 SAS Institute announced a partnership.[14] In June 2014 Accenture announced a service offering based on Cloudera.[15] In June 2014 Cloudera acquired Gazzang, which developed encryption and key management software.[16] In October 2014 Cloudera announces the first Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) Hadoop distribution with MasterCard.[17] In February 2015 Deloitte announced an alliance with Cloudera.[18] In May 2015 Capgemini announced a marketing program for SAP HANA and Cloudera.[19] In July 9, 2015 Cloudera announced a partnership with Teradata.[20] In September 2015 Cloudera announced the Kudu file format.[21] In September 2015 Microsoft Azure announced full support of Cloudera Enterprise.[22]
In January 2016 Tata Consultancy Services announced an Internet of things framework based on Cloudera for sensor data analytics.[23] In February 2016 EMC announces evolution in advanced storage with DSSD support for Cloudera[24]
In 2016, Cloudera was ranked #5 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[25]
Cloudera filed for an initial public offering in March 2017,[26] and on April 28, 2017, its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLDR.[27]
Products and services[edit]
Cloudera offers software, services and support in three bundles:

Cloudera Enterprise includes CDH and an annual subscription license (per node) to Cloudera Manager and technical support. It comes in three editions: Basic, Flex, and Data Hub.
Cloudera Express includes CDH and a version of Cloudera Manager lacking enterprise features such as rolling upgrades and backup/disaster recovery, LDAP and SNMP integration.
CDH may be downloaded from Cloudera's website at no charge, but with no technical support nor Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Navigator - provides data governance for Hadoop, offering capabilities such as data discovery, continuous optimization, audit, lineage, metadata management, and policy enforcement. As part of Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera Navigator helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.[28]
Cloudera Navigator Optimizer (beta) - A software as a service tool to provide insights into workloads and recommend optimization strategies.[29]

CDH contains the main, core elements of Hadoop that provide reliable, scalable distributed data processing of large data sets (chiefly MapReduce and HDFS), as well as other enterprise-oriented components that provide security, high availability, and integration with hardware and other software.[30]
In October 2012, Cloudera announced the Cloudera Impala project, an open-source distributed query engine for Apache Hadoop.[31]
Awards[edit]

In April 2010, Chief Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher was named a "Best Young Tech Entrepreneur" by Bloomberg BusinessWeek.[32]
In June 2012, received Morgan Stanley's "CTO Award for Innovation".[33]
In August 2012, CRN named Cloudera among the "The 25 Coolest Emerging Vendors For 2012".[34]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Cloudera Inc. is a United States-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.
Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[2]

History[edit]
Three engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook (Christophe Bisciglia, Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) joined with a former Oracle executive (Mike Olson) to form Cloudera in 2008.[3] Olson was the CEO of Sleepycat Software, the creator of the open-source embedded database engine Berkeley DB (acquired by Oracle in 2006). Awadallah was from Yahoo, where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.[4] At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.[5]
Architect Doug Cutting, also a former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, authored the open-source Lucene and Nutch search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009. Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.[6]
In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop in conjunction with a $5 million investment led by Accel Partners.[7] In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from Ignition Partners, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm with open connections to the CIA.[8]
In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at ArcSight when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010.[9] In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for which Intel received 18% share in Cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on Cloudera projects. With additional funds coming from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and an affiliate of MSD Capital, L.P., the private investment firm for Michael S. Dell. and others.[10]
In January 2012 Oracle Corporation announced a partnership with Cloudera for its Oracle Big Data Appliance.[11] In January 2013 Dell announced a partnership with Cloudera.[12] In March 2013 Intel invested $740 million in Cloudera for an 18% investment.[13] In May 2013 SAS Institute announced a partnership.[14] In June 2014 Accenture announced a service offering based on Cloudera.[15] In June 2014 Cloudera acquired Gazzang, which developed encryption and key management software.[16] In October 2014 Cloudera announces the first Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) Hadoop distribution with MasterCard.[17] In February 2015 Deloitte announced an alliance with Cloudera.[18] In May 2015 Capgemini announced a marketing program for SAP HANA and Cloudera.[19] In July 9, 2015 Cloudera announced a partnership with Teradata.[20] In September 2015 Cloudera announced the Kudu file format.[21] In September 2015 Microsoft Azure announced full support of Cloudera Enterprise.[22]
In January 2016 Tata Consultancy Services announced an Internet of things framework based on Cloudera for sensor data analytics.[23] In February 2016 EMC announces evolution in advanced storage with DSSD support for Cloudera[24]
In 2016, Cloudera was ranked #5 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[25]
Cloudera filed for an initial public offering in March 2017,[26] and on April 28, 2017, its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLDR.[27]
Products and services[edit]
Cloudera offers software, services and support in three bundles:

Cloudera Enterprise includes CDH and an annual subscription license (per node) to Cloudera Manager and technical support. It comes in three editions: Basic, Flex, and Data Hub.
Cloudera Express includes CDH and a version of Cloudera Manager lacking enterprise features such as rolling upgrades and backup/disaster recovery, LDAP and SNMP integration.
CDH may be downloaded from Cloudera's website at no charge, but with no technical support nor Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Navigator - provides data governance for Hadoop, offering capabilities such as data discovery, continuous optimization, audit, lineage, metadata management, and policy enforcement. As part of Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera Navigator helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.[28]
Cloudera Navigator Optimizer (beta) - A software as a service tool to provide insights into workloads and recommend optimization strategies.[29]

CDH contains the main, core elements of Hadoop that provide reliable, scalable distributed data processing of large data sets (chiefly MapReduce and HDFS), as well as other enterprise-oriented components that provide security, high availability, and integration with hardware and other software.[30]
In October 2012, Cloudera announced the Cloudera Impala project, an open-source distributed query engine for Apache Hadoop.[31]
Awards[edit]

In April 2010, Chief Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher was named a "Best Young Tech Entrepreneur" by Bloomberg BusinessWeek.[32]
In June 2012, received Morgan Stanley's "CTO Award for Innovation".[33]
In August 2012, CRN named Cloudera among the "The 25 Coolest Emerging Vendors For 2012".[34]

Cloudera Inc. is a United States-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.
Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[2]

History[edit]
Three engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook (Christophe Bisciglia, Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) joined with a former Oracle executive (Mike Olson) to form Cloudera in 2008.[3] Olson was the CEO of Sleepycat Software, the creator of the open-source embedded database engine Berkeley DB (acquired by Oracle in 2006). Awadallah was from Yahoo, where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.[4] At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.[5]
Architect Doug Cutting, also a former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, authored the open-source Lucene and Nutch search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009. Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.[6]
In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop in conjunction with a $5 million investment led by Accel Partners.[7] In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from Ignition Partners, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm with open connections to the CIA.[8]
In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at ArcSight when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010.[9] In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for which Intel received 18% share in Cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on Cloudera projects.

Cloudera Inc. is a United States-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.
Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[2]

History[edit]
Three engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook (Christophe Bisciglia, Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) joined with a former Oracle executive (Mike Olson) to form Cloudera in 2008.[3] Olson was the CEO of Sleepycat Software, the creator of the open-source embedded database engine Berkeley DB (acquired by Oracle in 2006). Awadallah was from Yahoo, where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.[4] At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.[5]
Architect Doug Cutting, also a former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, authored the open-source Lucene and Nutch search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009. Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.[6]
In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop in conjunction with a $5 million investment led by Accel Partners.[7] In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from Ignition Partners, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm with open connections to the CIA.[8]
In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at ArcSight when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010.[9] In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for which Intel received 18% share in Cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on Cloudera projects. With additional funds coming from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and an affiliate of MSD Capital, L.P., the private investment firm for Michael S. Dell. and others.[10]
In January 2012 Oracle Corporation announced a partnership with Cloudera for its Oracle Big Data Appliance.[11] In January 2013 Dell announced a partnership with Cloudera.[12] In March 2013 Intel invested $740 million in Cloudera for an 18% investment.[13] In May 2013 SAS Institute announced a partnership.[14] In June 2014 Accenture announced a service offering based on Cloudera.[15] In June 2014 Cloudera acquired Gazzang, which developed encryption and key management software.[16] In October 2014 Cloudera announces the first Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) Hadoop distribution with MasterCard.[17] In February 2015 Deloitte announced an alliance with Cloudera.[18] In May 2015 Capgemini announced a marketing program for SAP HANA and Cloudera.[19] In July 9, 2015 Cloudera announced a partnership with Teradata.[20] In September 2015 Cloudera announced the Kudu file format.[21] In September 2015 Microsoft Azure announced full support of Cloudera Enterprise.[22]
In January 2016 Tata Consultancy Services announced an Internet of things framework based on Cloudera for sensor data analytics.[23] In February 2016 EMC announces evolution in advanced storage with DSSD support for Cloudera[24]
In 2016, Cloudera was ranked #5 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[25]
Cloudera filed for an initial public offering in March 2017,[26] and on April 28, 2017, its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLDR.[27]
Products and services[edit]
Cloudera offers software, services and support in three bundles:

Cloudera Enterprise includes CDH and an annual subscription license (per node) to Cloudera Manager and technical support. It comes in three editions: Basic, Flex, and Data Hub.
Cloudera Express includes CDH and a version of Cloudera Manager lacking enterprise features such as rolling upgrades and backup/disaster recovery, LDAP and SNMP integration.
CDH may be downloaded from Cloudera's website at no charge, but with no technical support nor Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Navigator - provides data governance for Hadoop, offering capabilities such as data discovery, continuous optimization, audit, lineage, metadata management, and policy enforcement. As part of Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera Navigator helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.[28]
Cloudera Navigator Optimizer (beta) - A software as a service tool to provide insights into workloads and recommend optimization strategies.[29]

CDH contains the main, core elements of Hadoop that provide reliable, scalable distributed data processing of large data sets (chiefly MapReduce and HDFS), as well as other enterprise-oriented components that provide security, high availability, and integration with hardware and other software.[30]
In October 2012, Cloudera announced the Cloudera Impala project, an open-source distributed query engine for Apache Hadoop.[31]
Awards[edit]

In April 2010, Chief Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher was named a "Best Young Tech Entrepreneur" by Bloomberg BusinessWeek.[32]
In June 2012, received Morgan Stanley's "CTO Award for Innovation".[33]
In August 2012, CRN named Cloudera among the "The 25 Coolest Emerging Vendors For 2012".[34]
