As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) filed on June 22, 2017, the Company entered into agreements with affiliates of BioMed Realty, L.P. to purchase the real property located at 2855 Gazelle Court, Carlsbad, California (the “Gazelle Property”) for a purchase price of $79.4 million and the real property located at 2282 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California (the “Faraday Property”) for a purchase price of $14.0 million (each, a “Purchase”).
On July 18, 2017, the Company, through two separate wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Ionis Subsidiaries”), completedeach Purchaseand entered into two separate loan agreements (the “Loan Agreements”) with UBS AG (“UBS”) to partially finance each Purchase. The remainder of the aggregate purchase price was paid with cash on hand.
One loan is secured by a mortgage on the Gazelle Property (the “Gazelle Loan”), is in the amount of $51,350,000 and bears annual interest at a rate equal to 3.881%. The other loan is secured by a mortgage on the Faraday Property (the “Faraday Loan”, and together with the Gazelle Loan, collectively, the “Loans”), is in the amount of $9,100,000 and bears annual interest at a rate equal to 4.211%. Each Loan requires monthly interest-only payments for the initial sixty months of the term, and thereafter requires monthly principal amortization payments on the basis of a thirty year amortization schedule, with the applicable principal balance due on the maturity date of August 6, 2027. Each Loan contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants.

Severe & Rare Our severe and rare disease franchise is the largest franchise in our pipeline. We believe that our antisense technology could offer effective therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases and neurological disorders that are life-threatening or fatal and for which there are limited treatment options. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there are approximately 5,000 to 8,000 rare diseases, many life-threatening or fatal. Unfortunately, patients with many of these severe and rare diseases have few effective therapies available. Since most severe and rare diseases are genetic or have a genetic component, parents often pass the disease to their children, creating a legacy of the disease and resulting in profound effects on the family. IONIS-SMNRx, the most advanced neurological drug in our pipeline, is now in two Phase 3 studies for the treatment of infants and children with SMA.
We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat severe and rare and neurological diseases for which there is a need for new treatment options. We have established strategic alliances in drug development areas that are high risk or in which our partners have significant expertise and resources to allow us to expand our drug discovery and development efforts beyond what we would choose to do internally. For example, our strategic partnerships with Biogen Idec and Roche have supported advancing five drugs for the treatment of neuromuscular or neurological diseases in our pipeline.
Due to the severe nature of these diseases and the lack of available treatments, there is an opportunity for more flexible and efficient development paths to the market. This means that, in some cases, the studies necessary for us to demonstrate proof-of-concept with a particular drug may also be the studies that complete our marketing registration package, thereby providing us with a relatively rapid path to market for potential new treatments for devastating and often fatal diseases.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

SPINRAZA® (nusinersen)SMN2BiogenSpinal Muscular Atrophy in Pediatric and Adult PatientsGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Description/Summary
SPINRAZA is a Generation 2+ antisense drug approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a disease caused by mutations in the chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. SPINRAZA is designed to selectively bind to and alter the splicing of a single RNA from the SMN2 gene, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of full-length SMN protein.

SPINRAZA is administered via intrathecal injection, which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spinal cord, where motor neurons degenerate in patients with SMA due to insufficient levels of SMN protein.

The most common adverse reactions reported for SPINRAZA were upper respiratory infection, lower respiratory infection and constipation. Serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in SPINRAZA-treated patients. Coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides.

Current Status
SPINRAZA is approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of SMA. 

In December 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved SPINRAZA under Priority Review for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. In June 2017, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for SPINRAZA for the treatment of 5q SMA, the most common form of the disease, representing approximately 95% of all SMA cases. SPINRAZA is the first and only approved treatment for SMA in the U.S. and EU.

Biogen licensed the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in August 2016 and is now responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for SPINRAZA. Biogen has submitted regulatory filings in Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Switzerland and plans to initiate additional filings in other countries in 2017. 

For more information on the FDA and EC approvals of SPINRAZA, please see our press releases here and here.

For more information about SPINRAZA and U.S. prescribing information, visit www.SPINRAZA.com.

For SPINRAZA prescribing information in the EU, please visit http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/.
Clinical Data
The safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA has been evaluated from multiple clinical studies in more than 270 patients, including two Phase 3 studies:  ENDEAR, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with later-onset SMA; as well as open-label studies in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients with, or likely to develop, Types 1, 2 and 3 SMA.

Both the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile of SPINRAZA. In the ENDEAR end of study analysis, a statistically significant greater percentage of children with infant-onset SMA achieved improvement in motor milestones compared to untreated patients, with some infants in the SPINRAZA group achieving full head control, the ability to roll, sitting, and standing. Additionally, infants treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in event-free survival compared to untreated patients. For more details see our press release here. In the CHERISH pre-specified interim analysis, there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in children with later-onset SMA treated with SPINRAZA compared to untreated children. The end of study data were consistent with the interim analysis and presented at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Boston, Mass., April 2017. For more details see our press release here.  


About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. 

Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA. 

SPINRAZA is the first and only approved treatment for SMA in the U.S. and EU. 

To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.
Partner
In August 2016, Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA and is responsible for future development, manufacturing, and commercialization.

In conjunction with approval in the U.S., Ionis earned a $60 million milestone payment from Biogen. In conjunction with the approval in the EU, Ionis earned a $50 million milestone payment. As of June 2017, Ionis has earned more than $375 million from Biogen related to SPINRAZA. Ionis is eligible to receive a $40 million milestone payment from Biogen following the approval of SPINRAZA in Japan, which is expected to occur in 2017. Ionis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on global sales of SPINRAZA. 

Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals acknowledge support from the following organizations for SPINRAZA: Cure SMA, Muscular Dystrophy Association, SMA Foundation, the SMA Trust, and for intellectual property licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

In August 2015, we reported that the FOCUS FH study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a statistically significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol after 60 weeks of treatment of once weekly injections of 200 mg of KYNAMRO compared to placebo.  LDL-cholesterol reduction was similar to that observed in previous Phase 3 studies.  In addition, based on the data available for review, the safety profile of KYNAMRO observed in the FOCUS FH trial was similar to the safety profile reported in previous Phase 3 studies.  
About Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
HoFH is a rare genetic disease characterized by extreme cholesterol levels. People with HoFH have inherited mutations that limit the body's ability to clear cholesterol. HoFH is extremely rare: it is believed to occur in only one out of every one million persons. Today, it is estimated that HoFH affects about 6,000 people globally.  HoFH may be diagnosed by clinical or genetic parameters, and may be considered in cases of unusually high LDL-C, such as greater than 500 mg/dL without treatment, or 300 mg/dL after taking cholesterol-lowering medication. Because HoFH is genetic, it is important that all family members of people with HoFH know their cholesterol levels, regardless of their age.

AlicaforsenICAM-1AtlanticPouchitisAntisense drug
Indication*: Pouchitis

Description/Summary:
Alicaforsen is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1. Ulcerative colitis, or UC, is an inflammatory bowel disease of the colon, a part of the large intestine, and pouchitis is an inflammation of the surgically constructed internal pouch created in UC patients who have had their diseased colons removed. In 2007, we licensed alicaforsen to Atlantic Pharmaceuticals for pouchitis, UC and other inflammatory diseases. Atlantic Pharmaceuticals is developing alicaforsen for the treatment of UC and currently supplies alicaforsen in response to physicians' requests under international Named Patient Supply regulations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In January 2017, Atlantic announced that it received agreement from the FDA to initiate a rolling submission of its NDA for alicaforsen to treat pouchitis ahead of data from an ongoing Phase 3 study, which is expected in the second half of 2017.

VolanesorsenApoCIIIAkceaFamilial Chylomicronemia SyndromeGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) 

Description/Summary
Volanesorsen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce apoC-III protein production and reduce triglycerides for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL). ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood and is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Humans who do not produce apoC-III or have mutations that result in decreased apoC-III levels have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, people with elevated triglycerides are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and for type 2 diabetes, and people with severely elevated triglycerides are at high risk for acute pancreatitis and other serious conditions. 
The US and European regulatory agencies have granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS. The European regulatory agency has also granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of FPL. 

Clinical Data
In March of 2017, we announced that the pivotal Phase 3 APPROACH study of volanesorsen met its primary endpoint of reducing triglyceride levels in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). APPROACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week Phase 3 study in 66 patients with FCS. Volanesorsen-treated patients (n=33) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 77% from baseline after 3 months of treatment, compared to a mean increase of 18% in placebo-treated patients (n=33).  This represented a mean absolute reduction of 1,712 mg/dL in treated patients.  The treatment effect observed was sustained over the 52-week treatment period.  Volanesorsen-treated patients with the highest documented frequency of pancreatitis attacks suffered no attacks during the 52-week treatment period.  A reduction in abdominal pain was observed in volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients.

In the study, there were no treatment-related liver adverse events, including no increases in liver fat.  There were no treatment-related renal adverse events.  The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions (ISRs), which were mostly mild.  Declines in platelet counts associated with decreases in triglycerides were observed in many patients. These were generally well managed with dose adjustment.  In the volanesorsen Phase 3 program, there were infrequent serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) in three volanesorsen-treated patients, which resolved without incident following cessation of dosing.  In the entire volanesorsen clinical program 232 individuals have been treated with volanesorsen, including 66 FCS patients, some for more than two years.

For more information on the results of the APPROACH study, please see our press release here. 

In December of 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 COMPASS study met its primary endpoint.  COMPASS is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week Phase 3 study evaluating volanesorsen in 113 patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.  Of the 113 patients enrolled, there was a subset of seven patients with FCS enrolled in the study. 

In the COMPASS study, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=75) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 71.2% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean reduction of 0.9% in placebo-treated patients (n=38). In a subset of seven patients with FCS, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=5) achieved a mean reduction in triglycerides of 73% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean increase of 70% in placebo-treated patients (n=2). The mean absolute reduction in triglycerides in all volanesorsen-treated patients was 869 mg/dl; in the subset of patients with FCS, the mean absolute reduction in triglycerides was 1,511 mg/dl.  The treatment effect observed was sustained through the end of the 26 week treatment period.  The majority of patients treated with volanesorsen achieved triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dL, which is below the risk level for acute pancreatitis.  Additionally, there was a lower incidence of pancreatitis in the volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo.

The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild.  There was one potentially related SAE on the drug-treated arm that occurred two weeks after the last study dose and resolved without treatment. In addition, there were no serious platelet events in the study.

For more information on the results of the COMPASS study, please see our press release here. 

We completed a broad Phase 2 program evaluating volanesorsen in patients with high, very high, and severely high triglycerides, in patients with high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes and in patients with FCS. We also evaluated volanesorsen both as a single agent and in combination with fibrates. In our Phase 2 program, in all patient groups studied, irrespective of their incoming triglyceride levels, we observed reductions in apoC-III, triglycerides and apoC-III-associated VLDL complexes, and an increase in HDL-C, with a positive effect on non-HDL in patients treated with volanesorsen . In addition, we observed in volanesorsen-treated patients with type 2 diabetes significant improvements in glucose control with trends toward enhanced insulin sensitivity.  The safety and tolerability profile of volanesorsen across the four Phase 2 studies supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of the study in patients with very high to severely high triglycerides, please see our press release here.

About Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome
FCS is a severe, rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides and the risk of recurrent, potentially fatal pancreatitis.  People with FCS are unable to effectively clear large, triglyceride-rich lipid particles called chylomicrons due to a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that helps to break down triglycerides.  FCS is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 patients worldwide. There is no effective therapy available.  Additional information on FCS is available at www.fcsfocus.com and through the FCS Foundation at www.livingwithfcs.org and the LPLD Alliance at www.lpldalliance.org.

Inotersen (IONIS-TTRRx)TTRGSKFamilial Amyloid PolyneuropathyGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
 Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy

Description/Summary
Inotersen is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of transthyretin, or TTR, to treat TTR amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal disease. In patients with TTR amyloidosis both the mutant and wild type (wt) TTR build up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues.  As the TTR protein fibrils enlarge more tissue damage occurs and the disease worsens, resulting in poor quality of life and eventually death. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Status to inotersen for the treatment of patients with FAP. The European Medicines Agency has granted Orphan Drug Designation to inotersen for the treatment of patients with TTR amyloidosis. 

Clinical Data
In May 2017, we reported that the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study of inotersen in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) met both its primary endpoints. The NEURO-TTR study was a Phase 3 randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-month, international study in 172 patients with FAP. Over the 15-month period of the study, inotersen-treated patients achieved statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) and the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) (p<0.0001 and p=0.0006, respectively). Statistically significant differences were also observed for both endpoints at eight months.

Patients treated with inotersen experienced more adverse events than those who were treated with placebo.  Two key safety findings related to thrombocytopenia and renal effects were observed during the study that required changes to the monitoring schedule.  Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues.  A detailed review of safety data from the study is ongoing.   

For more information on the results of these studies, please see our press release here.

In July 2016, we reported positive data from an ongoing Phase 2 study that showed evidence of cardiac disease stabilization in patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy treated with inotersen for 12 months. The Phase 2, open-label, investigator-initiated study is being conducted by Dr. Benson of Indiana University in patients with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) and wild-type TTR amyloidosis (wt-TTR amyloidosis) with baseline intraventricular septum (IVS) thickness >= 1.3cm.  The first eight patients treated with inotersen had a mean decrease of 4 percent in left ventricular mass from baseline as measured by MRI at 12 months.  This compares favorably to Dr. Benson's published natural history study in similar patients with an IVS >=1.3cm at study entry who had a mean increase of 14 percent in left ventricular mass as measured by MRI at 12 months. Improvements in multiple additional endpoints, including imaging, functional and biomarker endpoints also support disease stabilization. 

In July 2016, we also reported new data from the ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study of inotersen in patients with FAP who have completed the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study.  An analysis conducted on patients with 12 different mutations who reached up to 12 months of treatment in the NEURO-TTR OLE study showed approximately equal reduction of both wild-type and mutant TTR levels as measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  We also reported positive data from an analysis conducted in June 2016 on the subset of patients who have reached three months or more of treatment in the OLE study (n=74). The analysis showed a reduction in TTR protein levels up to 95 percent with a mean maximum (nadir) reduction of 77 percent compared to patients' baseline TTR levels at entry into the Phase 3 study. 

For more information on the results of these studies, please see our press release here.


Current Status
In May 2017, we completed a Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study. We and GSK continue to review the full data package from the NEURO-TTR study and plan to present detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting and submit results for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.  

The preparation of regulatory marketing applications for inotersen is underway. GSK has the option to license inotersen following review of additional data and prior to the submission of regulatory applications.

An open-label extension study, or OLE, is ongoing for patients who have completed the NEURO-TTR study, in which all patients are treated with inotersen. More than 95 percent of patients who have completed the NEURO-TTR study elected to participate in the OLE.  

About TTR Amyloidosis
TTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive and fatal disease with multiple overlapping clinical manifestations. There are three forms of TTR amyloidosis, FAP, FAC and wt-TTR amyloidosis, and all are caused by the inappropriate formation and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow.  The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to organ failure and eventually death.  Although TTR amyloidosis is fatal, therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with TTR amyloidosis are very limited and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs available.

FAP, now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. Patients with hATTR-PN experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions, such as walking. These patients also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromise their function and eventually leading to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset. There are an estimated 10,000 hATTR-PN patients worldwide. 

TTR-related cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle. Patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within 3 to 5 years from disease onset. TTR-related cardiomyopathy includes both the genetic form of the disease, FAC, now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM), and the wild-type form of the disease, wt-TTR amyloidosis, now referred to as ATTRwt. There are an estimated 40,000 hATTR-CM patients worldwide. Patients with hATTR-CM begin to experience symptom onset between 50 and 60 years of age, whereas patients with ATTRwt usually begin to experience symptom onset ten or more years later, generally over 70 years of age. There are an estimated 200,000 ATTRwt amyloidosis patients worldwide. 

Often patients with the polyneuropathy form of TTR amyloidosis will also have TTR build up in the heart and also experience cardiomyopathy symptoms. Similarly, patients with the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis may often have TTR build up in their peripheral nerves and can experience nerve damage and progressive difficulty with motor functions. 

Partner
In March 2010, we and GSK entered into a preferred partner alliance that provides GSK an option to develop and commercialize inotersen.

IONIS-HTTRxHTTRocheHuntington's DiseaseGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Huntington's Disease

Description/SummaryIONIS-HTTRx  is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin (HTT) protein, which is the genetic cause of Huntington's disease (HD).  HD is caused by expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the HTT gene, which produces a toxic protein that progressively destroys neurons in the brain.  As a result, HD patients experience progressive loss of mental faculties and physical control as their disease progresses.  

The European Medicines Agency has granted orphan drug designation to IONIS-HTTRx for the treatment of patients with HD.

Clinical Data We are evaluating IONIS-HTTRx  in a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with HD.

Current StatusWe are collaborating with Roche to develop IONIS-HTTRx  to treat patients with HD.  We initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with HD in July 2015.  The Phase 1/2a study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-HTTRx  in patients with early stage HD.  

For more information about the clinical study, please see our press release here. 

About Huntington's DiseaseHD is an inherited genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive loss of both mental faculties and physical control. It is caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the HTT gene. The resulting mutant HTT protein is toxic and gradually destroys neurons. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50, and worsen over a 10 to 25 year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there is no effective treatment or cure for the disease, and current available medicines only mask the patient's symptoms but do not slow down the underlying loss of neurons. 
PartnerIn April 2013, we and Roche entered into an alliance to develop treatments for HD based on our antisense technology and utilizing Roche's scientific expertise in developing neurodegenerative therapeutics. Under the agreement, Roche has the option to license IONIS-HTTRx from us through the completion of the Phase 1/2a study.  Prior to option exercise, we are responsible for the discovery and development of IONIS-HTTRx.  If Roche exercises its option, it will assume responsibility for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for the drug.  We will receive milestone payments from Roche as IONIS-HTTRx progresses in development, as well as royalties on sales of IONIS-HTTRx if it is commercialized.

IONIS-SOD1RxSOD1BiogenAmyotrophic Lateral SclerosisGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Description/Summary
IONIS-SOD1Rx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is the best understood genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Patients with ALS suffer progressive degeneration of the motor neurons, which results in a declining quality of life and ultimately death. A mutation in the SOD-1 gene results in an inherited form of ALS, referred to as SOD1-ALS.  There is substantial evidence that mutations in the SOD1 gene are responsible for a toxic gain of function that can lead to rapid progressive loss of motor neurons in patients with SOD1-ALS.  As a result, patients with SOD1-ALS experience muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty in breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to their disease.  Currently, treatment options for patients with ALS are extremely limited with no drugs that significantly slow disease progression.

Clinical Data
Biogen is evaluating IONIS-SOD1Rx in a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with ALS, primarily including patients with SOD1-ALS. 

Current Status
We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-SOD1Rx to treat patients with SOD1-ALS. We initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical study evaluating IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with ALS, including patients with SOD1-ALS, in December 2015. The Phase 1/2a study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with all forms of ALS and multiple ascending doses of IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with SOD1-ALS.

SOD1-ALS is the second most common familial form of ALS, accounting for up to 20 percent of familial ALS.  Familial ALS represents approximately 10 percent of all cases of ALS. Currently, treatment options for patients with ALS are extremely limited with no drugs that significantly slow disease progression.

Partner
In September 2013, Ionis and Biogen entered into a broad, strategic collaboration to leverage antisense technology to advance the treatment of neurological diseases, including IONIS-SOD1Rx. The collaboration combines Biogen's expertise in neurology with Ionis' leadership in antisense technology to develop novel therapies to treat neurological disorders. Biogen and Ionis work closely together to select and validate neurological disease targets and conduct drug discovery activities with the goal of identifying clinical development candidates. Ionis is primarily responsible for drug discovery and early development of antisense therapies. Biogen will be responsible for later stage development and commercialization of all drugs arising from the collaboration. Current development-stage programs include antisense drugs to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), nusinersen; myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), IONIS-DMPK-2.5Rx; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), IONIS-SOD1Rx, and an undisclosed neurodegenerative disease, IONIS-BIIB4Rx.  In addition to these four drugs, Ionis and Biogen have numerous opportunities to evaluate additional targets for the development of drugs to treat neurological disorders.

AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxANGPTL3AkceaRare Hyperlipidemias Generation 2+ LICA antisense drug

Indication*:Rare Hyperlipidemias 

Description/Summary:AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Studies have shown that elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein are associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels and thus lower risk of heart attacks and multiple metabolic disorders. 

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders including rare hyperlipidemias and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic complications as well as rare diseases such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). 

Clinical Data
In November 2016, at the American Heart Association Meeting, we and Akcea reported results from the initial cohort from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx has displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study.
For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of multiple lipid disorders. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2 study and then conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxin patients with hyperlipidemia with metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver, including patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Akcea also plans to conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. 

Current Status
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 study for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. 

Study Description
The Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. 

About Rare Hyperlipidemias
Rare hyperlipidemias are genetic diseases characterized by high levels of lipids or lipoproteins in the blood. Function or levels of various lipid clearing enzymes, like LPL and hepatic lipase, are decreased in patients with rare hyperlipidemias. These patients may also have a reduced ability to clear other lipids, including LDL, leading to very high lipid levels. Examples of diseases in this category include FCS and familial hypercholesterolemia. Despite existing and emerging therapies, there remains an unmet need to reduce multiple lipid parameters in these patients, including LDL and triglycerides. 

Partner
Akcea Therapeutics is responsible for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx as part of its lipid franchise.

IONIS-PKKRxPKK-Hereditary AngioedemaGeneration 2+ antisense drug 
Indication*:
Hereditary Angioedema

Description/Summary:
IONIS-PKKRx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat patients with hereditary angioedema, or HAE.  PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE.  HAE is a rare genetic disease characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea.  HAE can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent and reduce the severity of HAE attacks. However, current prophylactic treatment approaches are very limited and have major tolerability issues due to challenging administration requirements leaving patients with few therapeutic options. 

Clinical Data
We completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers. In this study, subjects treated with IONIS-PKKRx achieved dose-dependent reductions of up to 95 percent in PKK.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-PKKRx supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this Phase 1 study, please see our press release here.

Current Status 
We are developing IONIS-PKKRx as a prophylactic treatment for patients with HAE. We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers that evaluated multiple doses of IONIS-PKKRx.

About Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea. HAE affects approximately 20,000 patients in the United States and Europe and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent and reduce the severity of HAE attacks. However, current prophylactic treatment approaches are very limited and have major tolerability issues due to challenging administration requirements leaving patients with few therapeutic options.

RG-012miR-21RegulusAlport SyndromeAnti-miR oligonucleotide
Indication*: Alport Syndrome

Description/Summary:
RG-012 is an anti-miR, or an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of microRNA, targeting microRNA-21, or miR-21, to treat patients with Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a life-threatening genetic kidney disease with no approved therapy. While there is little known information on the progression of this disease, scientists believe that miR-21 plays a critical role because they have observed increased miR-21 levels in animal models of Alport syndrome and in patients with chronic kidney disease. Regulus is developing RG-012 in a strategic alliance with Genzyme, a Sanofi company, to treat Alport syndrome. In June 2015, Regulus initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of RG-012.

IONIS-GHR-LRxGHr-AcromegalyGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*:
Acromegaly
Description/Summary
IONIS-GHR-LRx is a LICA Generation 2.0+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the growth hormone receptor (GHr) to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a hormone primarily produced in the liver that plays an important role in childhood growth and has anabolic effects in adults. Several different diseases result from abnormally low or high levels of IGF-1, or an inappropriate response to this hormone. When produced in excess, IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, slowly progressing and life-threatening disease.

Current Status
IONIS-GHR-LRx is being evaluated in a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. 

About GHr and Acromegaly
Acromegaly is a chronic, slowly progressing and life-threatening disease most often caused by oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) by benign pituitary tumors. Elevated levels of GH can overstimulate growth hormone receptors (GHr) and induce excess production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). High levels of circulating GH and IGF-1 lead to this multisystem disease characterized by organ overgrowth and physical disfigurement, such as enlarged hands, feet, and facial features. Patients with acromegaly also experience multiple comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory complications, as well as premature mortality. Because IGF-1 mediates the majority of the growth-promoting action of GH, reducing GHr production could in turn decrease levels of IGF-1 and provide a potential treatment to patients with acromegaly. Current treatments to block IGF-1 include surgical removal of the pituitary gland, which is often unsuccessful. Drug treatments to normalize IGF-1 levels are also available but are associated with potentially serious side effects.

IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRxTMPRSS6-β-ThalassemiaGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*:Beta-thalassemia and Iron Toxicity 

Description/Summary:IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand-conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce the production of transmembrane protease, serine 6, or TMPRSS6, to treat anemia and iron toxicity in patients with beta-thalassemia; a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene. TMPRSS6 is a protein produced in the liver that plays an important role in the regulation of the body's iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin. Inhibition of TMPRSS6 leads to increased production of hepcidin, which results in more effective red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability.  Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of TMPRSS6 may be an effective strategy to control iron availability, improve liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of beta-thalassemia.    

Current Status
The ongoing Phase 1 study, initiated in June, 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers evaluating single and multiple doses of IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx.  Plans are in progress to evaluate IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx in patients with various forms of beta-thalassemia in the future, including, beta-thalassemia intermedia.

About Beta-thalassemia
Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the beta globin gene resulting in defective red blood cell production. Patients with beta-thalassemia can experience severe anemia, splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, as well as iron toxicity. While the severity of anemia varies between patients, iron toxicity is a common complication leading to high rates of mortality as a result of iron accumulation in major organs, such as the heart and liver. Currently there are no effective therapies for patients with beta-thalassemia. The current standard of care is managing patients' symptoms with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, iron chelation and splenectomy.  

Beta-thalassemia can be further subdivided into patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT), such as beta-thalassemia intermedia.  Although transfusions are not needed to support life in patients with NTDT, the associated complications of the disease are severe and often fatal.

 Cardiovascular Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. A common cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, or premature plaque buildup, which occurs when cholesterol and inflammatory cells accumulate in blood vessels. Researchers have shown a strong correlation between high cholesterol levels and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. As such, lowering cholesterol is a key component in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease.
Cardiovascular disease is an area of focus for us. We have created a cardiovascular disease franchise comprised of drugs that target all the key components of cardiovascular disease, including various atherogenic lipids, inflammation and thrombosis, an aberrant blood clot formation responsible for most heart attacks and strokes. We have designed the majority of the drugs in our cardiovascular franchise to target cardiovascular risk factors. These drugs make up our lipid franchise and include IONIS-APO(a)Rx and IONIS-ANGPTL3Rx. Recent additions to our lipid franchise are our drugs that lower Lp(a) and angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Lp(a) is another independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. ANGPTL3 is a genetically validated target shown to play a significant role in regulating lipid levels. Humans who do not produce a functional ANGPTL3 protein due to a genetic mutation have extremely low levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, and very low levels of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. Currently available lipid-lowering therapies do not significantly lower apoC-III, triglycerides, Lp(a), or ANGPTL3. We believe that reducing levels of apoC-III, Lp(a) and ANGPTL3 could provide a complimentary approach to lipid-lowering therapies, including KYNAMRO(R). We are also developing follow-on LICA antisense drugs for the three drugs in our lipid franchise.
In order to maximize the value of our lipid franchise, while also maintaining control over the development and commercialization of these assets, we have created a wholly owned subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics. Akcea is focused on the development and commercialization of our lipid franchise drugs and their follow on compounds.
In addition to our lipid franchise drugs, we have a promising anticoagulant agent, IONIS-FXIRx, in development in our cardiovascular disease franchise. We recently reported Phase 2 data on IONIS-FXIRx showing that IONIS-FXIRx-treated patients experienced a seven-fold lower incidence of venous thromboembolism and numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin, a commonly used anticoagulant. These data demonstrate that for the first time, an anticoagulant, IONIS-FXIRx, can prevent clotting without increasing bleeding, two biological events that were previously inseparable. Our latest drug to enter the franchise, IONIS-AGT-LRx, offers a novel approach to treating patients with high blood pressure.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

IONIS-FXIRx (BAY 2306001)Factor XIBayer Clotting DisordersGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Antithrombosis

Description/Summary:
IONIS-FXIRx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of Factor XI, a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component of the coagulation pathway.  High levels of Factor XI increase the risk of blood clot formation inside blood vessels (thrombosis), which can cause heart attacks and strokes.  Alternatively, individuals deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thrombosis-related events and little to no increase in bleeding risk. This makes Factor XI an attractive target for an antithrombotic drug because of the potential to separate antithrombotic activity from bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, these anticoagulants are associated with increased bleeding risk at therapeutic doses, which can lead to major, sometimes fatal bleeding events. In clinical studies, IONIS-FXIRx has demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of Factor XI activity, which was associated with significant reductions in clotting events and no increase in major bleeding events. These data coupled with data in humans with little to no Factor XI activity provide evidence that IONIS-FXIRx has the potential to be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic drugs are needed, especially in patient populations that are at high risk for thrombosis and are also at high risk for bleeding. 

Clinical Data 
In November 2016, we announced positive data from a Phase 2 placebo-controlled study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. In this Phase 2 study patients treated with IONIS-FXIRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in Factor XI activity. In patients treated with 200 mg and 300 mg of IONIS-FXIRx, a mean percent reduction in FXI activity of 56% (p=<0.001) and 71% (p=<0.001), respectively, was achieved at week 13, compared to a mean percent reduction of 4% for placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, a decrease in severe clots in the dialysis circuit after six weeks compared to baseline was observed.  IONIS-FXIRx displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study. There were no clinically meaningful reductions in platelet levels and no treatment-related major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

In December 2014, we presented positive data from a Phase 2 comparator-controlled study evaluating the incidence of venous thrombolic events (VTE) in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery, or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  In this study, patients treated with 300 mg/week of IONIS-FXIRx experienced a seven-fold (p<0.0001) lower incidence of VTEs compared to patients treated with enoxaparin, a commonly used anti-coagulant.  In addition, IONIS-FXIRx-treated patients experienced numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-FXIRx supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

Current Status 
We are currently preparing to conduct a Phase 2b study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in approximately 200 patients with ESRD on hemodialysis to finalize dose selection. At the conclusion of this study, our partner, Bayer, will be responsible for all subsequent global clinical development activities as well as worldwide regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-FXIRx.

About Thrombosis
Thrombosis is the aberrant formation of blood clots inside blood vessels. Blood clots can obstruct blood flow to prevent sufficient oxygen flow to tissues and organs.  In addition, clot fragments can break off from the blood clot and travel downstream to occlude other parts of the circulation.  Thrombosis is responsible for many heart attacks and strokes and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
 
Current antithrombotic treatments include anticoagulants such as warfarin, Factor Xa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors.  Although these drugs are effective at lowering the risk of thrombosis, these drugs place patients at significant risk of serious bleeding because they target factors required for normal coagulation.  

Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation process.  Factor XI's role in blood coagulation is in clot stabilization and expansion and not in clot initiation.  People with high levels of Factor XI have increased risk of thrombosis while those with deficient Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and minimal risk of bleeding.
Partner
In February 2017, we announced the advancement of IONIS-FXIRx in clinical development under an existing exclusive agreement with Bayer. Under this agreement, Ionis will also initiate development of the LICA drug, IONIS-FXI-LRx. In conjunction with Bayer's decision to advance these programs, Ionis received a $75 million payment from Bayer.

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRxApo(a)Akcea/NovartisCVDGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:CVD

Description/Summary:AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce apolipoprotein(a) in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), a very atherogenic and thrombogenic form of LDL. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease.  Currently, there is no effective drug therapy to specifically and robustly lower elevated levels of Lp(a).  Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels.  Even patients who can control their LDL-C remain at high-risk of cardiovascular events if they have high levels of Lp(a).  

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated Lp(a). We believe AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is the first and currently only drug in clinical development designed to selectively and robustly inhibit the production of Lp(a).

Clinical DataIn November 2015, we reported results from a Phase 1/2a study evaluating AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in subjects with high Lp(a). In this clinical study, we observed significant and sustained reductions in Lp(a) of up to 97 percent with a mean reduction of 79 percent after a single, small volume dose of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. With multiple doses of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we observed even greater reductions of Lp(a) of up to 99 percent with a mean reduction of 92 percent.  AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was equally effective regardless of starting Lp(a) levels. The safety and tolerability profile of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx supports continued development. 
In November 2015, we also reported positive results on IONIS-APO(a)Rx, our non-LICA Lp(a)-lowering drug, from a Phase 2 study in patients with high (50-175 mg/dL) and very high (>175 mg/dL) Lp(a) levels. In this study, subjects treated with IONIS-APO(a)Rx achieved up to 94 percent in Lp(a), with a mean reduction of 71 percent in Lp(a). 

For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2a and Phase 2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Akcea is conducting a Phase 2 dose-ranging study with ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx to choose the optimal dose and dose schedule for the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study.  At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug and continue to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.  If Novartis exercises its option and pays Akcea $150 million license fee, Novartis plans to conduct a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in a high-risk patient population and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.  Akcea retains the right to co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx through its specialty sales force focused on lipid specialists on terms and conditions to be agreed with Novartis.

Current Status We and Akcea completed a Phase 1/2a study for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in subjects with high Lp(a). In March 2017, Akcea initiated a Phase 2 dose-ranging study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hypolipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD to determine the dose level and frequency for use in a future cardiovascular outcome study.   

Study Description The Phase 2 dose-ranging study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hypolipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD. The goal of the study is to determine the dose level and frequency for use in a future cardiovascular outcome study

About Lp(a)Lp(a) is a lipoprotein particle assembled in the liver that consists of an LDL-C-like particle and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) is considered a key driver for cardiovascular disease due to its association with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.  There is evidence that elevated Lp(a) levels may contribute directly to heart attacks. Lp(a) levels in blood can vary greatly between individuals primarily due to genetic variations. Because elevated Lp(a) is a genetically determined condition that is not responsive to lifestyle changes, patients are unable to adequately control their Lp(a) levels through improved diet or increased physical activity. Moreover, current therapies are not able to reduce Lp(a) to recommended levels in patients who have high Lp(a). Although Lp(a) can be measured by a routine lipid blood panel, the lack of drugs to effectively lower Lp(a) has made treating patients with Lp(a)-driven cardiovascular disease difficult. 

PartnerAKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is part of our lipid franchise and, as such, our subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics, is responsible for developing and commercializing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. In January 2017, we and Akcea entered into a strategic collaboration with Novartis to co-develop and co-commercialize globally AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.

AKCEA-APOCIII-LRxApoCIIIAkcea/NovartisCVDGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:CVD
Description/Summary:AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by volanesorsen, for the broad population of patients who are at risk for cardiometabolic disease due to elevated triglyceride levels.  ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood.  ApoC-III levels and elevated triglycerides have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of CVD.  In contrast, people with elevated levels of apoC-III have high triglycerides associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.  In addition, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in patients with elevated triglycerides.   
Clinical DataIn January 2017, we reported single dose data from a Phase 1/2a study evaluating AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in healthy volunteers.  Treatment with single doses of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx resulted in robust, dose-dependent reductions in apoC-III. The safety and tolerability profile of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the Phase 1/2a study supports continued development. 
Development Plan AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2a study and then conduct a Phase 2 dose-ranging study to choose the optimal dose and dose schedule for the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study.  At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug and continue to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.  If Novartis exercises its option and pays Akcea $150 million license fee, Novartis plans to conduct a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in a high-risk patient population and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.  Akcea retains the right to co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx through its specialty sales force focused on lipid specialists on terms and conditions to be agreed with Novartis.
Current StatusAkcea initiated a Phase 1/2a study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the second half of 2016 in people with elevated triglycerides.
About ApoC-III and TriglyceridesApoC-III is an important emerging target linking hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular disease (CVD).  In several studies, apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD.  Further, its presence on lipoproteins may increase their atherogenicity.  A study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that out of a sample of over 100,000 people, individuals with an apoC-III loss-of-function mutation had a reduced risk of clinical coronary heart disease.  Each decrease of 1mg/dL in plasma levels of apoC-III was associated with a 4% decrease in the risk of incident coronary heart disease.  Triglycerides may also play a role in cardiovascular risk.  In two separate studies encompassing nearly 20,000 patients, as triglyceride levels increased, so did the risk of a cardiovascular event.  In summary, apoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes.  This combination of effects makes apoC-III a valuable target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, or for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled.

IONIS-AGT-LRXAGT-Treatment Resistant HypertensionGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:Treatment Resistant Hypertension
Description/Summary:
IONIS-AGT-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension (TRH).  Despite availability of generic antihypertensive agents, TRH is a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease.

Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a well-established method of treating hypertension and complications of hypertension. While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used, many patients with high blood pressure are not well controlled by these treatment options.  Angiotensinogen, the target of IONIS-AGT-LRx, is upstream of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the RAAS pathway.  Therefore, reducing angiotensinogen levels has the potential to decrease blood pressure in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by currently available treatment options.  Furthermore, inhibiting angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver, may maintain renal compensatory mechanisms, which could lead to fewer side effects compared to current standard of care.
Current Status
In March 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 study of IONIS-AGT-LRx in healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients with blood pressure controlled on ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
About Treatment Resistant Hypertension (TRH)
Approximately 70 million adults in the United States have hypertension, half of which have uncontrolled hypertension. About 12-15 percent of patients with uncontrolled hypertension have resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve a blood pressure goal of 140/90 (systolic/diastolic) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications. Current estimates approximate that there are up to three million patients with TRH in the U.S. Patients with TRH have been found to have 3-fold increased odds of having fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events relative to those with controlled hypertension.

 Cancer We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat cancers both internally and through our partnerships with AstraZeneca and OncoGenex Technologies Inc. Cancer is an area of significant unmet medical need and an area in which our antisense technology provides us with unique advantages in discovering new drugs. Cancer is an extremely complex disease that involves a large number of targets. With our technology we can evaluate a very broad and diverse range of targets and identify their involvement in different types of cancers. Using the information we gain early in research on each of these targets, we can quickly identify promising targets for an anti-cancer drug. We select anti-cancer targets that provide a multi-faceted approach to treating cancer.
Our cancer pipeline consists of anti-cancer antisense drugs that act upon biological targets associated with cancer progression and/or treatment resistance. In 2012, we formed an anti-cancer alliance with AstraZeneca that expands our anti-cancer efforts and supports an aggressive and broad clinical development plan for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx and IONIS-AR-2.5Rx. AstraZeneca brings significant experience that enables the identification of novel genetic and epigenetic targets for cancer.

expertise with our drug discovery technology, we plan to expand our cancer franchise with a number of promising new anti-cancer targets.
We believe the favorable tolerability and early evidence of clinical benefit of the anti-cancer drugs in our pipeline demonstrate how uniquely suited our technology is to create novel cancer therapeutics. In addition, we believe our generation 2.5 chemistry enhances the potency and effectiveness of our antisense drugs, and extends the applicability of our technology to cancers that are difficult to treat. For instance, data from a Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx showed evidence of antitumor activity in patients with cancer, including advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

Apatorsen (OGX-427)Hsp27OncoGenexCancerGeneration 2.0 antisense drug
Indication*:
Cancer 

Description/Summary
Apatorsen is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of heat shock protein 27, or Hsp27, to treat patients with cancer. In January 2005, we entered into an agreement with OncoGenex to develop apatorsen. Under the terms of the agreement, OncoGenex is responsible for all development costs and activities. OncoGenex and collaborators are evaluating apatorsen in multiple Phase 2 studies in patients with cancer.

IONIS-AR-2.5Rx (AZD5312)AR-Prostate CancerGeneration 2.5 antisense drug
Indication*:
Cancer 

Description/Summary
IONIS-AR-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD5312, is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene, to treat patients with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent, and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens.   

Clinical Data
In January 2016, we announced that results from the Phase 1/2 study with IONIS-AR-2.5Rx in heavily pretreated, late-stage prostate cancer patients demonstrated encouraging data, including several durable reductions in PSA levels.  The drug also exhibited a good safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.  

Current Status
AstraZeneca completed an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx in patients with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. We plan to continue developing IONIS-AR-2.5Rx, independent of AstraZeneca.

About Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men, with approximately 30,000 deaths each year in the United States.  For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens. Although androgen deprivation therapy approaches are initially effective in delaying disease progression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, over time the course of the disease will progress in many of these patients. Resistance to current therapies is frequent and can occur through a variety of mechanisms including the activation of AR signaling in tumor cells through the amplification, overexpression and mutation of the AR gene.

IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD9150, is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, for the treatment of patients with cancer.  STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival.  STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver and multiple myeloma.  Overactivity in STAT3 is believed to prevent cell death and promote tumor cell growth.

Clinical Data
In November 2014, at the European Cancer Symposium, AstraZeneca presented results from a Phase 1/2 study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in patients with advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, a type of liver cancer.  Results from this study showed that treatment with IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx provided evidence of antitumor activity in patients with HCC.  In this late-stage population, several patients experienced stable disease and one patient experienced a durable, partial response while on IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx treatment.    

For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, please see our press release here. 

Current Status
AstraZeneca is evaluating IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx  in combination with MEDI4736, AstraZeneca's investigational anti-PD-L1 drug, in two studies, in patients with head and neck cancer and in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

About STAT3 and Cancer
STAT3, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, is an important mediator of signaling in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Mutations in STAT3 and other regulatory genes could result in constitutively active STAT3.  Numerous studies have demonstrated constitutive STAT3 activation promotes tumor cell growth and survival.  Indeed, activated STAT3 are present in a wide variety of human tumors, including hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) as well as diverse solid tumors (head and neck, breast, lung, gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal and prostate cancer).  

Partner
In 2012, we licensed IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx to AstraZeneca for the treatment of cancer.  We are conducting a clinical study evaluating IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in patients with advanced lymphomas, including patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.  We are responsible for completing our clinical study in patients with advanced lymphomas and AstraZeneca is responsible for all other global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx. We received an upfront payment from AstraZeneca when we initiated the broad strategic collaboration, and a milestone payment related to the ongoing IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx study.  We are eligible to receive additional milestone payments and royalties from AstraZeneca.

About KRAS and Cancer
KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of up to 30% of human tumors. The KRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division and tumor cell survival. Developing therapeutics using traditional drug modalities to block KRAS activity has proven difficult. Antisense technology may provide a novel solution for such difficult targets because antisense drugs can be designed to selectively inhibit the RNA sequence for a target with high specificity. 

Partner
IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx is a development candidate identified under a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to discover and develop antisense drugs for cancer. In December 2016, we received $28 million from AstraZeneca when we advanced IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx into development and AstraZeneca licensed IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx.  AstraZeneca is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $137 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments and up to low double-digit royalties from sales of the drug.

IONIS-FB-LRxCFBGSKDry Age-related Macular DegenerationGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*: Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Description/Summary
IONIS-FB-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce the production of complement factor B (FB) for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Genetic association studies have shown that overactivation of an innate immunogenic cascade has been associated with the development of dry AMD.  Complement Factor B, which plays a pivotal role in this cascade, is produced predominately in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system, including in capillaries in the eye.1-5  

AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries. It is estimated that more than three million people in the United States will be affected by the disease by 2020. Dry AMD accounts for 85% of all cases of AMD.6
Clinical Data
In May 2017, we presented results from a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers.  Healthy volunteers treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to a 50%.  Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-FB-LRx supports further clinical development.  

Current Status We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in healthy volunteers.  We are currently preparing to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with dry AMD.  

About Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries.  It is estimated that more than three million people in the United States will be affected by the disease by 2020.6 AMD is believed to be a systemic disease with local disease manifestation at the aging retinal macula.  AMD gradually destroys vision in the center of the visual field due to progressive damage of the retina.7
PartnerIn March 2010, we and GSK entered into a preferred partner alliance that provides GSK an option to develop and commercialize IONIS-FB-LRx. We are responsible for development of this program up to Phase 2 proof-of-concept, at which time GSK has the exclusive option to license the drug.  We are also eligible to receive double-digit royalties on sales of IONIS-FB-LRx.

 Metabolic Metabolic disorders are chronic diseases that affect millions of people. There is still a significant need for new therapies for these patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes affects more than 29 million people in the United States, or nine percent of the population, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 to 95 percent of those cases.
Metabolic disease is a very large area of medical need and is another area in which we focus our drug discovery and development efforts. Our approach is to develop antisense drugs that doctors can add to existing therapies to treat diabetes. One hurdle for traditional drug development is that most traditional drugs cannot selectively target a disease-causing protein without also affecting closely related proteins, which often results in unwanted side effects. We design our antisense drugs to target the gene responsible for producing the disease-causing protein while avoiding unwanted effects on closely related proteins, thereby reducing the risk of side effects.
We have reported positive Phase 2 data from IONIS-GCGRRx and IONIS-PTP1BRx, the most advanced drugs in our metabolic franchise. These two drugs and our third drug, IONIS-GCCRRx, are designed to act upon targets in the liver or fat tissue through a distinct mechanism to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce glucose production, or affect other metabolic aspects of this complex disease.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

IONIS-GCGRRxGCGR-DiabetesGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Type 2 Diabetes

Description/Summary:
IONIS-GCGRRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of glucagon receptors, or GCGR, to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.  GCGR is a receptor for the hormone glucagon.  Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, particularly in type 2 diabetes. In patients with advanced diabetes, uncontrolled glucagon action can lead to significant increase in blood glucose level.  In addition, reducing GCGR produces more active glucagon-like peptide, or GLP-1, a hormone that preserves pancreatic function and enhances insulin secretion.

Clinical Data 
In January 2017, we reported results from the Phase 2 dose optimization study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in 79 patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on stable, maximal metformin therapy. In this study, patients treated with IONIS-GCGRRx achieved robust and sustained, statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other measures of glucose control after 26 weeks of treatment.  Patients treated with 50 mg and 75 mg weekly doses achieved mean reductions in HbA1c of 0.7 percentage points (p < 0.05) and 1.4 percentage points (p < 0.001) from baseline, respectively, compared to a reduction of 0.1 percentage points for placebo-treated patients, in an intent to treat (ITT) analysis. IONIS-GCGRRx-treated patients experienced a mean increase in total GLP-1 from baseline compared to a decline in placebo-treated patients.  IONIS-GCGRRx was generally safe and well tolerated in the study.

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

In May 2014, we reported data from a Phase 2 study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on stable metformin therapy at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions. In this study, patients treated with 100mg and 200mg weekly doses of IONIS-GCGRRx achieved significant reductions in measures of glucose control after only 13 weeks of treatment. In addition, IONIS-GCGRRx-treated patients experienced increased plasma GLP-1 levels.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-GCGRRx in the Phase 2 study supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

Current Status 
We have completed two Phase 2 studies with IONIS-GCGRRx: 1) a 13-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on stable metformin therapy and 2) a 26-week study to identify the optimal dose and schedule to achieve glucose control with manageable glucagon receptor-related liver enzyme elevations. 

We are now evaluating partnership opportunities for IONIS-GCGRRx.
 
About Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the blood glucose levels are too high. Although glucose is an important source of energy for your body and is vital to your health, uncontrolled increases in glucose can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes. Diabetes is separated in type 1 and type 2.  In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin.  In type 2 diabetes, the more common type, the body does not make or use insulin well and therefore, blood glucose levels are not regulated properly.   

Diabetes is an epidemic that continues to grow at an alarming rate.  According to the latest Center for Disease Control statistics released, there are currently 29 million people in the U.S. that have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 to 95 percent of those cases.  Moreover, an additional 86 million American adults, or one out of every three adults, are prediabetic.  It is estimated that 15 to 30 percent of prediabetic people will develop full-fledged metabolic disorder within five years.

AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxANGPTL3AkceaNAFLD/Metabolic ComplicationsGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug

Indication*:Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Metabolic Complications

Description/Summary:AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Studies have shown that elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein are associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels and thus lower risk of heart attacks and multiple metabolic disorders. 

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders including rare hyperlipidemias and NAFLD and metabolic complications as well as rare diseases such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). 

Clinical Data
In November 2016, at the American Heart Association Meeting, we and Akcea reported results from the initial cohort from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx has displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study.
For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of multiple lipid disorders. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2 study and then conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with hyperlipidemia with metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver, including patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Akcea also plans to conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. 

Current Status
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 study for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. 

Study Description
The Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. 

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
While some fat in the liver is normal, a significant percentage of individuals have elevated levels of liver fat. Individuals with excessive fat accumulation in the liver also have elevated risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These risks are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia, especially those with elevated triglyceride levels. The most common form of fatty liver disease is NAFLD, which is associated with obesity-related disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver, or steatosis. One of the key causes of this condition is the Western diet, which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content. In the early stages of NAFLD, patients typically experience steatosis that is slow-progressing. Over time, a subset of these patients progress to steatohepatitis, a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD characterized by chronic inflammation and liver-cell damage, called NASH. Over time, the chronic inflammation caused by NASH can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver, known as fibrosis. As scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue, blood flow is restricted, which can lead to the loss of normal liver function, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer and ultimately liver failure. Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically for NAFLD or NASH. If the disease ultimately progresses beyond NASH, the only alternative is a liver transplant.

RG-125miR-103/107RegulusNASH in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes/Pre-DiabetesGalNAc-conjugated anti-miR oligonucleotide 
Indication*:
NASH in patients with Type 2 Diabetes/Pre-Diabetes

Description/Summary:
RG-125, also referred to as AZD4076, is a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-103/107, or miR-103/107, for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes.  The role of miR-103/107 in insulin sensitivity and resistance was first recognized by the laboratory of Dr. Markus Stoffel, Professor of the Institute of Molecular Health Sciences at ETH Zurich.  Regulus reported that inhibition of miR-103/107 with anti-miRs led to a sustained reduction in fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels in mouse models.

In December 2015, Regulus completed a technology transfer to AstraZeneca and has no further obligations to AstraZeneca for future development of RG-125.  That same month, AstraZeneca commenced clinical development of RG-125 by initiating a Phase 1 study evaluating RG-125 (AZD4076) in healthy volunteers.

In the third quarter of 2016, AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 1/2a, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in subjects with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

IONIS-DGAT2RxDGAT2-NASHGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: NASH (Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis)

Description/Summary:IONIS-DGAT2Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of DGAT2, or diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, to treat patients with NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  NASH is a common liver disease characterized by excessive triglycerides in the liver with concurrent inflammation and cellular damage. DGAT2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis in the liver.  Reducing the production of DGAT2 should therefore decrease triglyceride synthesis in the liver.  In animal studies, antisense inhibition of DGAT2 significantly improved liver steatosis, lowered blood lipid levels and reversed diet-induced insulin resistance in animal models of obesity and fatty liver disease. [3,5]

NASH is sometimes considered a "silent" liver disease because people with early-stage NASH feel well, even though they are starting to accumulate fat in their livers, and may not be aware that they have the disease.  However, NASH can develop into more severe diseases such as liver cirrhosis and liver failure.  Currently, liver transplant is the only therapeutic option for patients with liver cirrhosis.  In addition, NASH has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer. 

Current StatusIn November 2016, we announced the completion of a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of IONIS-DGAT2Rx in healthy overweight volunteers (body mass index between 29 and 38 kg/m2).  NASH is most commonly found in persons who are overweight or obese.  This study in overweight subjects was designed to give us valuable insights on the effects of IONIS-DGAT2Rx in a patient population who are closely matched to patients with NASH. In this study, volunteers received doses of up to 300 mg/week, administered for 6 weeks. The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-DGAT2Rx as demonstrated in this study supports continued development.

About NASHNASH is a liver disease characterized by the presence of excessive liver fat (steatosis) that is accompanied by inflammation and cellular damage.  NASH is considered a "silent" liver disease because in the early stages of the disease, patients generally feel well and are unaware they have the disease.  However, as NASH progresses, scarring, or fibrosis, begins to accumulate in the liver.  Ultimately, cirrhosis of the liver develops and the liver can no longer function normally.  About 20 percent of NASH patients are reported to develop cirrhosis, and 30 to 40 percent of patients with NASH cirrhosis experience liver-related death. [4] Currently, liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Because of the high prevalence of NASH, it has recently become the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the US. [2] The exact cause of NASH is not well understood but the development of fatty liver diseases has been linked to obesity.  As the number of people with obesity continues to rise globally, a parallel increase in the incidence of NASH has also been observed. Currently, it is estimated that 2 to 3 percent of the general population have NASH. [1]  However, with the growing obesity epidemic, it is likely that the number of patients with NASH will also continue to rise.

Severe & Rare Our severe and rare disease franchise is the largest franchise in our pipeline. We believe that our antisense technology could offer effective therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases and neurological disorders that are life-threatening or fatal and for which there are limited treatment options. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there are approximately 5,000 to 8,000 rare diseases, many life-threatening or fatal. Unfortunately, patients with many of these severe and rare diseases have few effective therapies available. Since most severe and rare diseases are genetic or have a genetic component, parents often pass the disease to their children, creating a legacy of the disease and resulting in profound effects on the family. IONIS-SMNRx, the most advanced neurological drug in our pipeline, is now in two Phase 3 studies for the treatment of infants and children with SMA.
We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat severe and rare and neurological diseases for which there is a need for new treatment options. We have established strategic alliances in drug development areas that are high risk or in which our partners have significant expertise and resources to allow us to expand our drug discovery and development efforts beyond what we would choose to do internally. For example, our strategic partnerships with Biogen Idec and Roche have supported advancing five drugs for the treatment of neuromuscular or neurological diseases in our pipeline.
Due to the severe nature of these diseases and the lack of available treatments, there is an opportunity for more flexible and efficient development paths to the market. This means that, in some cases, the studies necessary for us to demonstrate proof-of-concept with a particular drug may also be the studies that complete our marketing registration package, thereby providing us with a relatively rapid path to market for potential new treatments for devastating and often fatal diseases.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

SPINRAZA® (nusinersen)SMN2BiogenSpinal Muscular Atrophy in Pediatric and Adult PatientsGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Description/Summary
SPINRAZA is a Generation 2+ antisense drug approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a disease caused by mutations in the chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. SPINRAZA is designed to selectively bind to and alter the splicing of a single RNA from the SMN2 gene, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of full-length SMN protein.

SPINRAZA is administered via intrathecal injection, which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spinal cord, where motor neurons degenerate in patients with SMA due to insufficient levels of SMN protein.

The most common adverse reactions reported for SPINRAZA were upper respiratory infection, lower respiratory infection and constipation. Serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in SPINRAZA-treated patients. Coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides.

Current Status
SPINRAZA is approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of SMA. 

In December 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved SPINRAZA under Priority Review for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. In June 2017, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for SPINRAZA for the treatment of 5q SMA, the most common form of the disease, representing approximately 95% of all SMA cases. SPINRAZA is the first and only approved treatment for SMA in the U.S. and EU.

Biogen licensed the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in August 2016 and is now responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for SPINRAZA. Biogen has submitted regulatory filings in Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Switzerland and plans to initiate additional filings in other countries in 2017. 

For more information on the FDA and EC approvals of SPINRAZA, please see our press releases here and here.

For more information about SPINRAZA and U.S. prescribing information, visit www.SPINRAZA.com.

For SPINRAZA prescribing information in the EU, please visit http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/.
Clinical Data
The safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA has been evaluated from multiple clinical studies in more than 270 patients, including two Phase 3 studies:  ENDEAR, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with later-onset SMA; as well as open-label studies in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients with, or likely to develop, Types 1, 2 and 3 SMA.

Both the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile of SPINRAZA. In the ENDEAR end of study analysis, a statistically significant greater percentage of children with infant-onset SMA achieved improvement in motor milestones compared to untreated patients, with some infants in the SPINRAZA group achieving full head control, the ability to roll, sitting, and standing. Additionally, infants treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in event-free survival compared to untreated patients. For more details see our press release here. In the CHERISH pre-specified interim analysis, there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in children with later-onset SMA treated with SPINRAZA compared to untreated children. The end of study data were consistent with the interim analysis and presented at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Boston, Mass., April 2017. For more details see our press release here.  


About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. 

Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA. 

SPINRAZA is the first and only approved treatment for SMA in the U.S. and EU. 

To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.
Partner
In August 2016, Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA and is responsible for future development, manufacturing, and commercialization.

In conjunction with approval in the U.S., Ionis earned a $60 million milestone payment from Biogen. In conjunction with the approval in the EU, Ionis earned a $50 million milestone payment. As of June 2017, Ionis has earned more than $375 million from Biogen related to SPINRAZA. Ionis is eligible to receive a $40 million milestone payment from Biogen following the approval of SPINRAZA in Japan, which is expected to occur in 2017. Ionis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on global sales of SPINRAZA. 

Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals acknowledge support from the following organizations for SPINRAZA: Cure SMA, Muscular Dystrophy Association, SMA Foundation, the SMA Trust, and for intellectual property licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

KYNAMRO®ApoB-100Kastle Homozygous FHGeneration 2.0 antisense drug
Indication: Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Description/Summary:
KYNAMRO(R) (mipomersen sodium) injection is an oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis indicated as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications and diet, to reduce low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in patients with HoFH. KYNAMRO(R) is approved for use in patients with HoFH in the United States and certain other countries. 

Click here to download full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide. 
Current Status 
KYNAMRO is approved for use in patients with HoFH in the United States and certain other countries.
 Clinical Data
In August 2015, we reported that the FOCUS FH study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a statistically significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol after 60 weeks of treatment of once weekly injections of 200 mg of KYNAMRO compared to placebo.  LDL-cholesterol reduction was similar to that observed in previous Phase 3 studies.  In addition, based on the data available for review, the safety profile of KYNAMRO observed in the FOCUS FH trial was similar to the safety profile reported in previous Phase 3 studies.  
About Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
HoFH is a rare genetic disease characterized by extreme cholesterol levels. People with HoFH have inherited mutations that limit the body's ability to clear cholesterol. HoFH is extremely rare: it is believed to occur in only one out of every one million persons. Today, it is estimated that HoFH affects about 6,000 people globally.  HoFH may be diagnosed by clinical or genetic parameters, and may be considered in cases of unusually high LDL-C, such as greater than 500 mg/dL without treatment, or 300 mg/dL after taking cholesterol-lowering medication. Because HoFH is genetic, it is important that all family members of people with HoFH know their cholesterol levels, regardless of their age.

AlicaforsenICAM-1AtlanticPouchitisAntisense drug
Indication*: Pouchitis

Description/Summary:
Alicaforsen is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1. Ulcerative colitis, or UC, is an inflammatory bowel disease of the colon, a part of the large intestine, and pouchitis is an inflammation of the surgically constructed internal pouch created in UC patients who have had their diseased colons removed. In 2007, we licensed alicaforsen to Atlantic Pharmaceuticals for pouchitis, UC and other inflammatory diseases. Atlantic Pharmaceuticals is developing alicaforsen for the treatment of UC and currently supplies alicaforsen in response to physicians' requests under international Named Patient Supply regulations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In January 2017, Atlantic announced that it received agreement from the FDA to initiate a rolling submission of its NDA for alicaforsen to treat pouchitis ahead of data from an ongoing Phase 3 study, which is expected in the second half of 2017.

VolanesorsenApoCIIIAkceaFamilial Chylomicronemia SyndromeGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) 

Description/Summary
Volanesorsen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce apoC-III protein production and reduce triglycerides for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL). ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood and is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Humans who do not produce apoC-III or have mutations that result in decreased apoC-III levels have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, people with elevated triglycerides are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and for type 2 diabetes, and people with severely elevated triglycerides are at high risk for acute pancreatitis and other serious conditions. 
The US and European regulatory agencies have granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS. The European regulatory agency has also granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of FPL. 

Clinical Data
In March of 2017, we announced that the pivotal Phase 3 APPROACH study of volanesorsen met its primary endpoint of reducing triglyceride levels in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). APPROACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week Phase 3 study in 66 patients with FCS. Volanesorsen-treated patients (n=33) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 77% from baseline after 3 months of treatment, compared to a mean increase of 18% in placebo-treated patients (n=33).  This represented a mean absolute reduction of 1,712 mg/dL in treated patients.  The treatment effect observed was sustained over the 52-week treatment period.  Volanesorsen-treated patients with the highest documented frequency of pancreatitis attacks suffered no attacks during the 52-week treatment period.  A reduction in abdominal pain was observed in volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients.

In the study, there were no treatment-related liver adverse events, including no increases in liver fat.  There were no treatment-related renal adverse events.  The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions (ISRs), which were mostly mild.  Declines in platelet counts associated with decreases in triglycerides were observed in many patients. These were generally well managed with dose adjustment.  In the volanesorsen Phase 3 program, there were infrequent serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) in three volanesorsen-treated patients, which resolved without incident following cessation of dosing.  In the entire volanesorsen clinical program 232 individuals have been treated with volanesorsen, including 66 FCS patients, some for more than two years.

For more information on the results of the APPROACH study, please see our press release here. 

In December of 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 COMPASS study met its primary endpoint.  COMPASS is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week Phase 3 study evaluating volanesorsen in 113 patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.  Of the 113 patients enrolled, there was a subset of seven patients with FCS enrolled in the study. 

In the COMPASS study, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=75) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 71.2% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean reduction of 0.9% in placebo-treated patients (n=38). In a subset of seven patients with FCS, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=5) achieved a mean reduction in triglycerides of 73% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean increase of 70% in placebo-treated patients (n=2). The mean absolute reduction in triglycerides in all volanesorsen-treated patients was 869 mg/dl; in the subset of patients with FCS, the mean absolute reduction in triglycerides was 1,511 mg/dl.  The treatment effect observed was sustained through the end of the 26 week treatment period.  The majority of patients treated with volanesorsen achieved triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dL, which is below the risk level for acute pancreatitis.  Additionally, there was a lower incidence of pancreatitis in the volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo.

The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild.  There was one potentially related SAE on the drug-treated arm that occurred two weeks after the last study dose and resolved without treatment. In addition, there were no serious platelet events in the study.

For more information on the results of the COMPASS study, please see our press release here. 

We completed a broad Phase 2 program evaluating volanesorsen in patients with high, very high, and severely high triglycerides, in patients with high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes and in patients with FCS. We also evaluated volanesorsen both as a single agent and in combination with fibrates. In our Phase 2 program, in all patient groups studied, irrespective of their incoming triglyceride levels, we observed reductions in apoC-III, triglycerides and apoC-III-associated VLDL complexes, and an increase in HDL-C, with a positive effect on non-HDL in patients treated with volanesorsen . In addition, we observed in volanesorsen-treated patients with type 2 diabetes significant improvements in glucose control with trends toward enhanced insulin sensitivity.  The safety and tolerability profile of volanesorsen across the four Phase 2 studies supports continued development.

About Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome
FCS is a severe, rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides and the risk of recurrent, potentially fatal pancreatitis.  People with FCS are unable to effectively clear large, triglyceride-rich lipid particles called chylomicrons due to a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that helps to break down triglycerides.  FCS is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 patients worldwide. There is no effective therapy available.  Additional information on FCS is available at www.fcsfocus.com and through the FCS Foundation at www.livingwithfcs.org and the LPLD Alliance at www.lpldalliance.org.

VolanesorsenApoCIIIAkceaFamilial Partial LipodystrophyGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) 

Description/Summary
Volanesorsen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce apoC-III protein production and reduce triglycerides for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL). ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood and is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Humans who do not produce apoC-III or have mutations that result in decreased apoC-III levels have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, people with elevated triglycerides are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and for type 2 diabetes, and people with severely elevated triglycerides are at high risk for acute pancreatitis and other serious conditions. 
The US and European regulatory agencies have granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS. The European regulatory agency has also granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of FPL. 
Clinical Data
In March of 2017, we announced that the pivotal Phase 3 APPROACH study of volanesorsen met its primary endpoint of reducing triglyceride levels in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). APPROACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week Phase 3 study in 66 patients with FCS. Volanesorsen-treated patients (n=33) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 77% from baseline after 3 months of treatment, compared to a mean increase of 18% in placebo-treated patients (n=33).  This represented a mean absolute reduction of 1,712 mg/dL in treated patients.  The treatment effect observed was sustained over the 52-week treatment period.  Volanesorsen-treated patients with the highest documented frequency of pancreatitis attacks suffered no attacks during the 52-week treatment period.  A reduction in abdominal pain was observed in volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients.

In the study, there were no treatment-related liver adverse events, including no increases in liver fat.  There were no treatment-related renal adverse events.  The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions (ISRs), which were mostly mild.  Declines in platelet counts associated with decreases in triglycerides were observed in many patients. These were generally well managed with dose adjustment.  In the volanesorsen Phase 3 program, there were infrequent serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) in three volanesorsen-treated patients, which resolved without incident following cessation of dosing.  In the entire volanesorsen clinical program 232 individuals have been treated with volanesorsen, including 66 FCS patients, some for more than two years.

For more information on the results of the APPROACH study, please see our press release here. 

In December of 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 COMPASS study met its primary endpoint.  COMPASS is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week Phase 3 study evaluating volanesorsen in 113 patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.  Of the 113 patients enrolled, there was a subset of seven patients with FCS enrolled in the study. 

In the COMPASS study, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=75) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 71.2% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean reduction of 0.9% in placebo-treated patients (n=38). In a subset of seven patients with FCS, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=5) achieved a mean reduction in triglycerides of 73% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean increase of 70% in placebo-treated patients (n=2). The mean absolute reduction in triglycerides in all volanesorsen-treated patients was 869 mg/dl; in the subset of patients with FCS, the mean absolute reduction in triglycerides was 1,511 mg/dl.  The treatment effect observed was sustained through the end of the 26 week treatment period.  The majority of patients treated with volanesorsen achieved triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dL, which is below the risk level for acute pancreatitis.  Additionally, there was a lower incidence of pancreatitis in the volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo.

The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild.  There was one potentially related SAE on the drug-treated arm that occurred two weeks after the last study dose and resolved without treatment. In addition, there were no serious platelet events in the study.

For more information on the results of the COMPASS study, please see our press release here. 

We completed a broad Phase 2 program evaluating volanesorsen in patients with high, very high, and severely high triglycerides, in patients with high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes and in patients with FCS. We also evaluated volanesorsen both as a single agent and in combination with fibrates.

In addition, we observed in volanesorsen-treated patients with type 2 diabetes significant improvements in glucose control with trends toward enhanced insulin sensitivity.  The safety and tolerability profile of volanesorsen across the four Phase 2 studies supports continued development.

Inotersen (IONIS-TTRRx)TTRGSKFamilial Amyloid PolyneuropathyGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
 Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy

Description/Summary
Inotersen is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of transthyretin, or TTR, to treat TTR amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal disease. In patients with TTR amyloidosis both the mutant and wild type (wt) TTR build up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues.  As the TTR protein fibrils enlarge more tissue damage occurs and the disease worsens, resulting in poor quality of life and eventually death. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Status to inotersen for the treatment of patients with FAP. The European Medicines Agency has granted Orphan Drug Designation to inotersen for the treatment of patients with TTR amyloidosis. 

Clinical Data
In May 2017, we reported that the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study of inotersen in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) met both its primary endpoints. The NEURO-TTR study was a Phase 3 randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-month, international study in 172 patients with FAP. Over the 15-month period of the study, inotersen-treated patients achieved statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) and the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) (p<0.0001 and p=0.0006, respectively). Statistically significant differences were also observed for both endpoints at eight months.

Patients treated with inotersen experienced more adverse events than those who were treated with placebo.  Two key safety findings related to thrombocytopenia and renal effects were observed during the study that required changes to the monitoring schedule.  Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues.  A detailed review of safety data from the study is ongoing.   

For more information on the results of these studies, please see our press release here.

In July 2016, we reported positive data from an ongoing Phase 2 study that showed evidence of cardiac disease stabilization in patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy treated with inotersen for 12 months. The Phase 2, open-label, investigator-initiated study is being conducted by Dr. Benson of Indiana University in patients with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) and wild-type TTR amyloidosis (wt-TTR amyloidosis) with baseline intraventricular septum (IVS) thickness >= 1.3cm.  The first eight patients treated with inotersen had a mean decrease of 4 percent in left ventricular mass from baseline as measured by MRI at 12 months.  This compares favorably to Dr. Benson's published natural history study in similar patients with an IVS >=1.3cm at study entry who had a mean increase of 14 percent in left ventricular mass as measured by MRI at 12 months. Improvements in multiple additional endpoints, including imaging, functional and biomarker endpoints also support disease stabilization. 

In July 2016, we also reported new data from the ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study of inotersen in patients with FAP who have completed the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study.  An analysis conducted on patients with 12 different mutations who reached up to 12 months of treatment in the NEURO-TTR OLE study showed approximately equal reduction of both wild-type and mutant TTR levels as measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  We also reported positive data from an analysis conducted in June 2016 on the subset of patients who have reached three months or more of treatment in the OLE study (n=74). The analysis showed a reduction in TTR protein levels up to 95 percent with a mean maximum (nadir) reduction of 77 percent compared to patients' baseline TTR levels at entry into the Phase 3 study. 

For more information on the results of these studies, please see our press release here.


Current Status
In May 2017, we completed a Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study. We and GSK continue to review the full data package from the NEURO-TTR study and plan to present detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting and submit results for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.  

The preparation of regulatory marketing applications for inotersen is underway. GSK has the option to license inotersen following review of additional data and prior to the submission of regulatory applications.

An open-label extension study, or OLE, is ongoing for patients who have completed the NEURO-TTR study, in which all patients are treated with inotersen. More than 95 percent of patients who have completed the NEURO-TTR study elected to participate in the OLE.  

About TTR Amyloidosis
TTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive and fatal disease with multiple overlapping clinical manifestations. There are three forms of TTR amyloidosis, FAP, FAC and wt-TTR amyloidosis, and all are caused by the inappropriate formation and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow.  The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to organ failure and eventually death.  Although TTR amyloidosis is fatal, therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with TTR amyloidosis are very limited and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs available.

FAP, now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. Patients with hATTR-PN experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions, such as walking. These patients also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromise their function and eventually leading to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset. There are an estimated 10,000 hATTR-PN patients worldwide. 

TTR-related cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle. Patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within 3 to 5 years from disease onset. TTR-related cardiomyopathy includes both the genetic form of the disease, FAC, now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM), and the wild-type form of the disease, wt-TTR amyloidosis, now referred to as ATTRwt. There are an estimated 40,000 hATTR-CM patients worldwide. Patients with hATTR-CM begin to experience symptom onset between 50 and 60 years of age, whereas patients with ATTRwt usually begin to experience symptom onset ten or more years later, generally over 70 years of age. There are an estimated 200,000 ATTRwt amyloidosis patients worldwide. 

Often patients with the polyneuropathy form of TTR amyloidosis will also have TTR build up in the heart and also experience cardiomyopathy symptoms. Similarly, patients with the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis may often have TTR build up in their peripheral nerves and can experience nerve damage and progressive difficulty with motor functions. 

Partner
In March 2010, we and GSK entered into a preferred partner alliance that provides GSK an option to develop and commercialize inotersen.  We are responsible for completing the Phase 3 trials we are currently conducting. If GSK exercises its option, it will pay us a license fee and will assume all other global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities. We received an upfront payment from GSK when we initiated the broad strategic collaboration, and milestone payments related to inotersen.  We are eligible to receive additional milestone payments as the program progresses and a license fee if GSK exercises its option to license inotersen.  We are also eligible to receive royalties from GSK.

IONIS-HTTRxHTTRocheHuntington's DiseaseGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Huntington's Disease

Description/SummaryIONIS-HTTRx  is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin (HTT) protein, which is the genetic cause of Huntington's disease (HD).  HD is caused by expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the HTT gene, which produces a toxic protein that progressively destroys neurons in the brain.  As a result, HD patients experience progressive loss of mental faculties and physical control as their disease progresses.  

The European Medicines Agency has granted orphan drug designation to IONIS-HTTRx for the treatment of patients with HD.

Clinical Data We are evaluating IONIS-HTTRx  in a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with HD.

Current StatusWe are collaborating with Roche to develop IONIS-HTTRx  to treat patients with HD.  We initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with HD in July 2015.  The Phase 1/2a study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-HTTRx  in patients with early stage HD.  

For more information about the clinical study, please see our press release here. 

About Huntington's DiseaseHD is an inherited genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive loss of both mental faculties and physical control. It is caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the HTT gene. The resulting mutant HTT protein is toxic and gradually destroys neurons. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50, and worsen over a 10 to 25 year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there is no effective treatment or cure for the disease, and current available medicines only mask the patient's symptoms but do not slow down the underlying loss of neurons. 
PartnerIn April 2013, we and Roche entered into an alliance to develop treatments for HD based on our antisense technology and utilizing Roche's scientific expertise in developing neurodegenerative therapeutics. Under the agreement, Roche has the option to license IONIS-HTTRx from us through the completion of the Phase 1/2a study.  Prior to option exercise, we are responsible for the discovery and development of IONIS-HTTRx.  If Roche exercises its option, it will assume responsibility for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for the drug.  We will receive milestone payments from Roche as IONIS-HTTRx progresses in development, as well as royalties on sales of IONIS-HTTRx if it is commercialized.

IONIS-SOD1RxSOD1BiogenAmyotrophic Lateral SclerosisGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Description/Summary
IONIS-SOD1Rx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is the best understood genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Patients with ALS suffer progressive degeneration of the motor neurons, which results in a declining quality of life and ultimately death. A mutation in the SOD-1 gene results in an inherited form of ALS, referred to as SOD1-ALS.  There is substantial evidence that mutations in the SOD1 gene are responsible for a toxic gain of function that can lead to rapid progressive loss of motor neurons in patients with SOD1-ALS.  As a result, patients with SOD1-ALS experience muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty in breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to their disease.  Currently, treatment options for patients with ALS are extremely limited with no drugs that significantly slow disease progression.

Clinical Data
Biogen is evaluating IONIS-SOD1Rx in a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with ALS, primarily including patients with SOD1-ALS. 

Current Status
We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-SOD1Rx to treat patients with SOD1-ALS. We initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical study evaluating IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with ALS, including patients with SOD1-ALS, in December 2015. The Phase 1/2a study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with all forms of ALS and multiple ascending doses of IONIS-SOD1Rx in patients with SOD1-ALS.

SOD1-ALS is the second most common familial form of ALS, accounting for up to 20 percent of familial ALS.  Familial ALS represents approximately 10 percent of all cases of ALS. Currently, treatment options for patients with ALS are extremely limited with no drugs that significantly slow disease progression.

Partner
In September 2013, Ionis and Biogen entered into a broad, strategic collaboration to leverage antisense technology to advance the treatment of neurological diseases, including IONIS-SOD1Rx. The collaboration combines Biogen's expertise in neurology with Ionis' leadership in antisense technology to develop novel therapies to treat neurological disorders. Biogen and Ionis work closely together to select and validate neurological disease targets and conduct drug discovery activities with the goal of identifying clinical development candidates. Ionis is primarily responsible for drug discovery and early development of antisense therapies. Biogen will be responsible for later stage development and commercialization of all drugs arising from the collaboration. Current development-stage programs include antisense drugs to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), nusinersen; myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), IONIS-DMPK-2.5Rx; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), IONIS-SOD1Rx, and an undisclosed neurodegenerative disease, IONIS-BIIB4Rx.  In addition to these four drugs, Ionis and Biogen have numerous opportunities to evaluate additional targets for the development of drugs to treat neurological disorders.

AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxANGPTL3AkceaRare Hyperlipidemias Generation 2+ LICA antisense drug

Indication*:Rare Hyperlipidemias 

Description/Summary:AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Studies have shown that elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein are associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels and thus lower risk of heart attacks and multiple metabolic disorders. 

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders including rare hyperlipidemias and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic complications as well as rare diseases such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). 

Clinical Data
In November 2016, at the American Heart Association Meeting, we and Akcea reported results from the initial cohort from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx has displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study.
For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of multiple lipid disorders. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2 study and then conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxin patients with hyperlipidemia with metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver, including patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Akcea also plans to conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. 

Current Status
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 study for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. 

Study Description
The Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. 

About Rare Hyperlipidemias
Rare hyperlipidemias are genetic diseases characterized by high levels of lipids or lipoproteins in the blood. Function or levels of various lipid clearing enzymes, like LPL and hepatic lipase, are decreased in patients with rare hyperlipidemias. These patients may also have a reduced ability to clear other lipids, including LDL, leading to very high lipid levels. Examples of diseases in this category include FCS and familial hypercholesterolemia. Despite existing and emerging therapies, there remains an unmet need to reduce multiple lipid parameters in these patients, including LDL and triglycerides. 

Partner
Akcea Therapeutics is responsible for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx as part of its lipid franchise.

IONIS-PKKRxPKK-Hereditary AngioedemaGeneration 2+ antisense drug 
Indication*:
Hereditary Angioedema

Description/Summary:
IONIS-PKKRx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat patients with hereditary angioedema, or HAE.  PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE.  HAE is a rare genetic disease characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea.  HAE can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent and reduce the severity of HAE attacks. However, current prophylactic treatment approaches are very limited and have major tolerability issues due to challenging administration requirements leaving patients with few therapeutic options. 

Clinical Data
We completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers. In this study, subjects treated with IONIS-PKKRx achieved dose-dependent reductions of up to 95 percent in PKK.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-PKKRx supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this Phase 1 study, please see our press release here.

Current Status 
We are developing IONIS-PKKRx as a prophylactic treatment for patients with HAE. We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers that evaluated multiple doses of IONIS-PKKRx.

About Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea. HAE affects approximately 20,000 patients in the United States and Europe and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent and reduce the severity of HAE attacks. However, current prophylactic treatment approaches are very limited and have major tolerability issues due to challenging administration requirements leaving patients with few therapeutic options.

RG-012miR-21RegulusAlport SyndromeAnti-miR oligonucleotide
Indication*: Alport Syndrome

Description/Summary:
RG-012 is an anti-miR, or an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of microRNA, targeting microRNA-21, or miR-21, to treat patients with Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a life-threatening genetic kidney disease with no approved therapy. While there is little known information on the progression of this disease, scientists believe that miR-21 plays a critical role because they have observed increased miR-21 levels in animal models of Alport syndrome and in patients with chronic kidney disease. Regulus is developing RG-012 in a strategic alliance with Genzyme, a Sanofi company, to treat Alport syndrome. In June 2015, Regulus initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of RG-012.

IONIS-GHR-LRxGHr-AcromegalyGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*:
Acromegaly
Description/Summary
IONIS-GHR-LRx is a LICA Generation 2.0+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the growth hormone receptor (GHr) to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a hormone primarily produced in the liver that plays an important role in childhood growth and has anabolic effects in adults. Several different diseases result from abnormally low or high levels of IGF-1, or an inappropriate response to this hormone. When produced in excess, IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, slowly progressing and life-threatening disease.

Current Status
IONIS-GHR-LRx is being evaluated in a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. 

About GHr and Acromegaly
Acromegaly is a chronic, slowly progressing and life-threatening disease most often caused by oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) by benign pituitary tumors. Elevated levels of GH can overstimulate growth hormone receptors (GHr) and induce excess production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). High levels of circulating GH and IGF-1 lead to this multisystem disease characterized by organ overgrowth and physical disfigurement, such as enlarged hands, feet, and facial features. Patients with acromegaly also experience multiple comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory complications, as well as premature mortality. Because IGF-1 mediates the majority of the growth-promoting action of GH, reducing GHr production could in turn decrease levels of IGF-1 and provide a potential treatment to patients with acromegaly. Current treatments to block IGF-1 include surgical removal of the pituitary gland, which is often unsuccessful. Drug treatments to normalize IGF-1 levels are also available but are associated with potentially serious side effects.

IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRxTMPRSS6-β-ThalassemiaGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*:Beta-thalassemia and Iron Toxicity 

Description/Summary:IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand-conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce the production of transmembrane protease, serine 6, or TMPRSS6, to treat anemia and iron toxicity in patients with beta-thalassemia; a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene. TMPRSS6 is a protein produced in the liver that plays an important role in the regulation of the body's iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin. Inhibition of TMPRSS6 leads to increased production of hepcidin, which results in more effective red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability.  Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of TMPRSS6 may be an effective strategy to control iron availability, improve liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of beta-thalassemia.    

Current Status
The ongoing Phase 1 study, initiated in June, 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers evaluating single and multiple doses of IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx.  Plans are in progress to evaluate IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx in patients with various forms of beta-thalassemia in the future, including, beta-thalassemia intermedia.

About Beta-thalassemia
Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the beta globin gene resulting in defective red blood cell production. Patients with beta-thalassemia can experience severe anemia, splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, as well as iron toxicity. While the severity of anemia varies between patients, iron toxicity is a common complication leading to high rates of mortality as a result of iron accumulation in major organs, such as the heart and liver. Currently there are no effective therapies for patients with beta-thalassemia. The current standard of care is managing patients' symptoms with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, iron chelation and splenectomy.  

Beta-thalassemia can be further subdivided into patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT), such as beta-thalassemia intermedia.  Although transfusions are not needed to support life in patients with NTDT, the associated complications of the disease are severe and often fatal.

 Cardiovascular Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. A common cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, or premature plaque buildup, which occurs when cholesterol and inflammatory cells accumulate in blood vessels. Researchers have shown a strong correlation between high cholesterol levels and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. As such, lowering cholesterol is a key component in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease.
Cardiovascular disease is an area of focus for us. We have created a cardiovascular disease franchise comprised of drugs that target all the key components of cardiovascular disease, including various atherogenic lipids, inflammation and thrombosis, an aberrant blood clot formation responsible for most heart attacks and strokes. We have designed the majority of the drugs in our cardiovascular franchise to target cardiovascular risk factors. These drugs make up our lipid franchise and include IONIS-APO(a)Rx and IONIS-ANGPTL3Rx. Recent additions to our lipid franchise are our drugs that lower Lp(a) and angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Lp(a) is another independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. ANGPTL3 is a genetically validated target shown to play a significant role in regulating lipid levels. Humans who do not produce a functional ANGPTL3 protein due to a genetic mutation have extremely low levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, and very low levels of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. Currently available lipid-lowering therapies do not significantly lower apoC-III, triglycerides, Lp(a), or ANGPTL3. We believe that reducing levels of apoC-III, Lp(a) and ANGPTL3 could provide a complimentary approach to lipid-lowering therapies, including KYNAMRO(R). We are also developing follow-on LICA antisense drugs for the three drugs in our lipid franchise.
In order to maximize the value of our lipid franchise, while also maintaining control over the development and commercialization of these assets, we have created a wholly owned subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics. Akcea is focused on the development and commercialization of our lipid franchise drugs and their follow on compounds.
In addition to our lipid franchise drugs, we have a promising anticoagulant agent, IONIS-FXIRx, in development in our cardiovascular disease franchise. We recently reported Phase 2 data on IONIS-FXIRx showing that IONIS-FXIRx-treated patients experienced a seven-fold lower incidence of venous thromboembolism and numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin, a commonly used anticoagulant. These data demonstrate that for the first time, an anticoagulant, IONIS-FXIRx, can prevent clotting without increasing bleeding, two biological events that were previously inseparable. Our latest drug to enter the franchise, IONIS-AGT-LRx, offers a novel approach to treating patients with high blood pressure.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

IONIS-FXIRx (BAY 2306001)Factor XIBayer Clotting DisordersGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Antithrombosis

Description/Summary:
IONIS-FXIRx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of Factor XI, a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component of the coagulation pathway.  High levels of Factor XI increase the risk of blood clot formation inside blood vessels (thrombosis), which can cause heart attacks and strokes.  Alternatively, individuals deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thrombosis-related events and little to no increase in bleeding risk. This makes Factor XI an attractive target for an antithrombotic drug because of the potential to separate antithrombotic activity from bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, these anticoagulants are associated with increased bleeding risk at therapeutic doses, which can lead to major, sometimes fatal bleeding events. In clinical studies, IONIS-FXIRx has demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of Factor XI activity, which was associated with significant reductions in clotting events and no increase in major bleeding events. These data coupled with data in humans with little to no Factor XI activity provide evidence that IONIS-FXIRx has the potential to be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic drugs are needed, especially in patient populations that are at high risk for thrombosis and are also at high risk for bleeding. 

Clinical Data 
In November 2016, we announced positive data from a Phase 2 placebo-controlled study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. In this Phase 2 study patients treated with IONIS-FXIRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in Factor XI activity. In patients treated with 200 mg and 300 mg of IONIS-FXIRx, a mean percent reduction in FXI activity of 56% (p=<0.001) and 71% (p=<0.001), respectively, was achieved at week 13, compared to a mean percent reduction of 4% for placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, a decrease in severe clots in the dialysis circuit after six weeks compared to baseline was observed.  IONIS-FXIRx displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study. There were no clinically meaningful reductions in platelet levels and no treatment-related major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

In December 2014, we presented positive data from a Phase 2 comparator-controlled study evaluating the incidence of venous thrombolic events (VTE) in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery, or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  In this study, patients treated with 300 mg/week of IONIS-FXIRx experienced a seven-fold (p<0.0001) lower incidence of VTEs compared to patients treated with enoxaparin, a commonly used anti-coagulant.  In addition, IONIS-FXIRx-treated patients experienced numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-FXIRx supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

Current Status 
We are currently preparing to conduct a Phase 2b study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in approximately 200 patients with ESRD on hemodialysis to finalize dose selection. At the conclusion of this study, our partner, Bayer, will be responsible for all subsequent global clinical development activities as well as worldwide regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-FXIRx.

About Thrombosis
Thrombosis is the aberrant formation of blood clots inside blood vessels. Blood clots can obstruct blood flow to prevent sufficient oxygen flow to tissues and organs.  In addition, clot fragments can break off from the blood clot and travel downstream to occlude other parts of the circulation.  Thrombosis is responsible for many heart attacks and strokes and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
 
Current antithrombotic treatments include anticoagulants such as warfarin, Factor Xa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors.  Although these drugs are effective at lowering the risk of thrombosis, these drugs place patients at significant risk of serious bleeding because they target factors required for normal coagulation.  

Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation process.  Factor XI's role in blood coagulation is in clot stabilization and expansion and not in clot initiation.  People with high levels of Factor XI have increased risk of thrombosis while those with deficient Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and minimal risk of bleeding.
Partner
In February 2017, we announced the advancement of IONIS-FXIRx in clinical development under an existing exclusive agreement with Bayer. Under this agreement, Ionis will also initiate development of the LICA drug, IONIS-FXI-LRx. In conjunction with Bayer's decision to advance these programs, Ionis received a $75 million payment from Bayer.

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRxApo(a)Akcea/NovartisCVDGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:CVD

Description/Summary:AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce apolipoprotein(a) in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), a very atherogenic and thrombogenic form of LDL. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease.  Currently, there is no effective drug therapy to specifically and robustly lower elevated levels of Lp(a).  Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels.  Even patients who can control their LDL-C remain at high-risk of cardiovascular events if they have high levels of Lp(a).  

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated Lp(a). We believe AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is the first and currently only drug in clinical development designed to selectively and robustly inhibit the production of Lp(a).

Clinical DataIn November 2015, we reported results from a Phase 1/2a study evaluating AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in subjects with high Lp(a). In this clinical study, we observed significant and sustained reductions in Lp(a) of up to 97 percent with a mean reduction of 79 percent after a single, small volume dose of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. With multiple doses of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we observed even greater reductions of Lp(a) of up to 99 percent with a mean reduction of 92 percent.  AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was equally effective regardless of starting Lp(a) levels. The safety and tolerability profile of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx supports continued development. 
In November 2015, we also reported positive results on IONIS-APO(a)Rx, our non-LICA Lp(a)-lowering drug, from a Phase 2 study in patients with high (50-175 mg/dL) and very high (>175 mg/dL) Lp(a) levels. In this study, subjects treated with IONIS-APO(a)Rx achieved up to 94 percent in Lp(a), with a mean reduction of 71 percent in Lp(a). 

For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2a and Phase 2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Akcea is conducting a Phase 2 dose-ranging study with ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx to choose the optimal dose and dose schedule for the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study.  At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug and continue to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.  If Novartis exercises its option and pays Akcea $150 million license fee, Novartis plans to conduct a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in a high-risk patient population and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.  Akcea retains the right to co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx through its specialty sales force focused on lipid specialists on terms and conditions to be agreed with Novartis.

Current Status We and Akcea completed a Phase 1/2a study for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in subjects with high Lp(a). In March 2017, Akcea initiated a Phase 2 dose-ranging study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hypolipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD to determine the dose level and frequency for use in a future cardiovascular outcome study.   

Study Description The Phase 2 dose-ranging study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hypolipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD. The goal of the study is to determine the dose level and frequency for use in a future cardiovascular outcome study

About Lp(a)Lp(a) is a lipoprotein particle assembled in the liver that consists of an LDL-C-like particle and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) is considered a key driver for cardiovascular disease due to its association with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.  There is evidence that elevated Lp(a) levels may contribute directly to heart attacks. Lp(a) levels in blood can vary greatly between individuals primarily due to genetic variations. Because elevated Lp(a) is a genetically determined condition that is not responsive to lifestyle changes, patients are unable to adequately control their Lp(a) levels through improved diet or increased physical activity. Moreover, current therapies are not able to reduce Lp(a) to recommended levels in patients who have high Lp(a). Although Lp(a) can be measured by a routine lipid blood panel, the lack of drugs to effectively lower Lp(a) has made treating patients with Lp(a)-driven cardiovascular disease difficult. 

PartnerAKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is part of our lipid franchise and, as such, our subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics, is responsible for developing and commercializing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. In January 2017, we and Akcea entered into a strategic collaboration with Novartis to co-develop and co-commercialize globally AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.

AKCEA-APOCIII-LRxApoCIIIAkcea/NovartisCVDGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:CVD
Description/Summary:AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by volanesorsen, for the broad population of patients who are at risk for cardiometabolic disease due to elevated triglyceride levels.  ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood.  ApoC-III levels and elevated triglycerides have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of CVD.  In contrast, people with elevated levels of apoC-III have high triglycerides associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.  In addition, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in patients with elevated triglycerides.   
Clinical DataIn January 2017, we reported single dose data from a Phase 1/2a study evaluating AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in healthy volunteers.  Treatment with single doses of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx resulted in robust, dose-dependent reductions in apoC-III. The safety and tolerability profile of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the Phase 1/2a study supports continued development. 
Development Plan AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2a study and then conduct a Phase 2 dose-ranging study to choose the optimal dose and dose schedule for the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study.  At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug and continue to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.  If Novartis exercises its option and pays Akcea $150 million license fee, Novartis plans to conduct a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in a high-risk patient population and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.  Akcea retains the right to co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx through its specialty sales force focused on lipid specialists on terms and conditions to be agreed with Novartis.
Current StatusAkcea initiated a Phase 1/2a study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the second half of 2016 in people with elevated triglycerides.
About ApoC-III and TriglyceridesApoC-III is an important emerging target linking hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular disease (CVD).  In several studies, apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD.  Further, its presence on lipoproteins may increase their atherogenicity.  A study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that out of a sample of over 100,000 people, individuals with an apoC-III loss-of-function mutation had a reduced risk of clinical coronary heart disease.  Each decrease of 1mg/dL in plasma levels of apoC-III was associated with a 4% decrease in the risk of incident coronary heart disease.  Triglycerides may also play a role in cardiovascular risk.  In two separate studies encompassing nearly 20,000 patients, as triglyceride levels increased, so did the risk of a cardiovascular event.  In summary, apoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes.  This combination of effects makes apoC-III a valuable target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, or for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled.
PartnerAKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is part of our lipid franchise and, as such, our subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics, is responsible for developing and commercializing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In January 2017, we and Akcea entered into a strategic collaboration with Novartis to co-develop and co-commercialize globally AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.

IONIS-AGT-LRXAGT-Treatment Resistant HypertensionGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug
Indication*:Treatment Resistant Hypertension
Description/Summary:
IONIS-AGT-LRx is a LICA Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension (TRH).  Despite availability of generic antihypertensive agents, TRH is a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease.

Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a well-established method of treating hypertension and complications of hypertension. While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used, many patients with high blood pressure are not well controlled by these treatment options.  Angiotensinogen, the target of IONIS-AGT-LRx, is upstream of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the RAAS pathway.  Therefore, reducing angiotensinogen levels has the potential to decrease blood pressure in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by currently available treatment options.  Furthermore, inhibiting angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver, may maintain renal compensatory mechanisms, which could lead to fewer side effects compared to current standard of care.
Current Status
In March 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 study of IONIS-AGT-LRx in healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients with blood pressure controlled on ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
About Treatment Resistant Hypertension (TRH)
Approximately 70 million adults in the United States have hypertension, half of which have uncontrolled hypertension. About 12-15 percent of patients with uncontrolled hypertension have resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve a blood pressure goal of 140/90 (systolic/diastolic) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications. Current estimates approximate that there are up to three million patients with TRH in the U.S. Patients with TRH have been found to have 3-fold increased odds of having fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events relative to those with controlled hypertension.

 Cancer We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat cancers both internally and through our partnerships with AstraZeneca and OncoGenex Technologies Inc. Cancer is an area of significant unmet medical need and an area in which our antisense technology provides us with unique advantages in discovering new drugs. Cancer is an extremely complex disease that involves a large number of targets. With our technology we can evaluate a very broad and diverse range of targets and identify their involvement in different types of cancers. Using the information we gain early in research on each of these targets, we can quickly identify promising targets for an anti-cancer drug. We select anti-cancer targets that provide a multi-faceted approach to treating cancer.
Our cancer pipeline consists of anti-cancer antisense drugs that act upon biological targets associated with cancer progression and/or treatment resistance. In 2012, we formed an anti-cancer alliance with AstraZeneca that expands our anti-cancer efforts and supports an aggressive and broad clinical development plan for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx and IONIS-AR-2.5Rx. AstraZeneca brings significant experience that enables the identification of novel genetic and epigenetic targets for cancer.

expertise with our drug discovery technology, we plan to expand our cancer franchise with a number of promising new anti-cancer targets.
We believe the favorable tolerability and early evidence of clinical benefit of the anti-cancer drugs in our pipeline demonstrate how uniquely suited our technology is to create novel cancer therapeutics. In addition, we believe our generation 2.5 chemistry enhances the potency and effectiveness of our antisense drugs, and extends the applicability of our technology to cancers that are difficult to treat. For instance, data from a Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx showed evidence of antitumor activity in patients with cancer, including advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

IONIS-AR-2.5Rx (AZD5312)AR-Prostate CancerGeneration 2.5 antisense drug
Indication*:
Cancer 

Description/Summary
IONIS-AR-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD5312, is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene, to treat patients with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent, and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens.   

Clinical Data
In January 2016, we announced that results from the Phase 1/2 study with IONIS-AR-2.5Rx in heavily pretreated, late-stage prostate cancer patients demonstrated encouraging data, including several durable reductions in PSA levels.  The drug also exhibited a good safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.  

Current Status
AstraZeneca completed an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx in patients with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. We plan to continue developing IONIS-AR-2.5Rx, independent of AstraZeneca.

About Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men, with approximately 30,000 deaths each year in the United States.  For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens. Although androgen deprivation therapy approaches are initially effective in delaying disease progression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, over time the course of the disease will progress in many of these patients. Resistance to current therapies is frequent and can occur through a variety of mechanisms including the activation of AR signaling in tumor cells through the amplification, overexpression and mutation of the AR gene.

IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx (AZD9150)STAT3AstraZenecaCancerGeneration 2.5 antisense drug
Indication*:
Cancer 

Description/Summary
IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD9150, is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, for the treatment of patients with cancer.  STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival.  STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver and multiple myeloma.  Overactivity in STAT3 is believed to prevent cell death and promote tumor cell growth.

Clinical Data
In November 2014, at the European Cancer Symposium, AstraZeneca presented results from a Phase 1/2 study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in patients with advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, a type of liver cancer.  Results from this study showed that treatment with IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx provided evidence of antitumor activity in patients with HCC.  In this late-stage population, several patients experienced stable disease and one patient experienced a durable, partial response while on IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx treatment.    

For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, please see our press release here. 

Current Status
AstraZeneca is evaluating IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx  in combination with MEDI4736, AstraZeneca's investigational anti-PD-L1 drug, in two studies, in patients with head and neck cancer and in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

About STAT3 and Cancer
STAT3, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, is an important mediator of signaling in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Mutations in STAT3 and other regulatory genes could result in constitutively active STAT3.  Numerous studies have demonstrated constitutive STAT3 activation promotes tumor cell growth and survival.  Indeed, activated STAT3 are present in a wide variety of human tumors, including hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) as well as diverse solid tumors (head and neck, breast, lung, gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal and prostate cancer).  

Partner
In 2012, we licensed IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx to AstraZeneca for the treatment of cancer.  We are conducting a clinical study evaluating IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in patients with advanced lymphomas, including patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.  We are responsible for completing our clinical study in patients with advanced lymphomas and AstraZeneca is responsible for all other global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx. We received an upfront payment from AstraZeneca when we initiated the broad strategic collaboration, and a milestone payment related to the ongoing IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx study.  We are eligible to receive additional milestone payments and royalties from AstraZeneca.

IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx (AZD4785)KRASAstraZenecaCancerGeneration 2.5 antisense drug
Indication*:
Cancer 

Description/Summary
IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD4785, is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug designed to selectively inhibit KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. KRAS mutations are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of up to 30% of human tumors. The KRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division and tumor cell survival. 

Current Status
AstraZeneca is evaluating IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom KRAS may be an important driver of tumor survival.

About KRAS and Cancer
KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of up to 30% of human tumors. The KRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division and tumor cell survival. Developing therapeutics using traditional drug modalities to block KRAS activity has proven difficult. Antisense technology may provide a novel solution for such difficult targets because antisense drugs can be designed to selectively inhibit the RNA sequence for a target with high specificity. 

Partner
IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx is a development candidate identified under a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to discover and develop antisense drugs for cancer. In December 2016, we received $28 million from AstraZeneca when we advanced IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx into development and AstraZeneca licensed IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx.  AstraZeneca is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $137 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments and up to low double-digit royalties from sales of the drug.

 Other The broad applicability of our antisense technology allows us to create promising drugs and we have successfully developed novel drugs designed to treat many different diseases. In therapeutic areas that are outside of our core areas of development, we have licensed our drugs to highly focused satellite companies that have the specific expertise and resources to continue developing the drugs. Together with our partners we continue to advance drugs in clinical development that are outside of our core therapeutic areas, such as the ocular and antiviral drugs we and GSK are developing under our preferred partner collaboration.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

PlazomicinAminoglycosideAchaogenSevere Bacterial InfectionAminoglycoside 
Indication*:
Multi-drug resistant infection due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)  

Description/Summary:
Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside drug that Achaogen, Inc. is developing for the treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis that physicians can use to treat serious bacterial infections. In 2006, we licensed our proprietary aminoglycoside program to Achaogen. Achaogen discovered plazomicin based on technology licensed from us. In December 2016, Achaogen announced that it completed two Phase 3 studies of plazomicin. The EPIC trial met its primary endpoint in patients with complicated urinary tract infections. The CARE trial demonstrated reduction in mortality in patients with serious multi-drug resistant infection due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE compared with colistin therapy. Plazomicin was well tolerated in both Phase 3 studies. Achaogen plans to submit an NDA to the FDA for plazomicin in the second half of 2017 and a MAA to the EMA in 2018. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted plazomicin Breakthrough Therapy designation. Plazomicin has also received Fast Track designation and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QDIP) designation from the FDA.

IONIS-HBVRxHBVGSKHepatitis B Virus InfectionGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*:
Hepatitis B virus infection

Description/Summary
IONIS-HBVRx is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and replication, including hepatitis B surface antigen, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic HBV infection.  HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. 

Current Status
In March 2017, our partner GSK initiated a Phase 2 study of IONIS-HBVRx in treatment-naive patients with chronic HBV infection. We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of IONIS-HBVRx in healthy volunteers. The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-HBVRx demonstrated in this study supports continued development.  
About Hepatitis B virus infection
Hepatitis B virus infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not efficiently inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer.

Partner
In March 2010, we and GSK entered into a collaboration that provides GSK an option to develop and commercialize IONIS-HBVRx.  If GSK exercises its option, it will pay us a license fee and will assume all further global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities. We received an upfront payment from GSK when we initiated the broad strategic collaboration and milestone payments related to IONIS-HBVRx.  We are eligible to receive additional milestone payments as the program progresses and a license fee if GSK exercises its option to license IONIS-HBVRx.  We are also eligible to receive royalties from GSK.

IONIS-FB-LRxCFBGSKDry Age-related Macular DegenerationGeneration 2+ LICA antisense drug
Indication*: Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Description/Summary
IONIS-FB-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce the production of complement factor B (FB) for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Genetic association studies have shown that overactivation of an innate immunogenic cascade has been associated with the development of dry AMD.  Complement Factor B, which plays a pivotal role in this cascade, is produced predominately in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system, including in capillaries in the eye.1-5  

AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries. It is estimated that more than three million people in the United States will be affected by the disease by 2020. Dry AMD accounts for 85% of all cases of AMD.6
Clinical Data
In May 2017, we presented results from a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers.  Healthy volunteers treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to a 50%.  Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-FB-LRx supports further clinical development.  

Current Status We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in healthy volunteers.  We are currently preparing to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with dry AMD.  

About Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries.  It is estimated that more than three million people in the United States will be affected by the disease by 2020.6 AMD is believed to be a systemic disease with local disease manifestation at the aging retinal macula.  AMD gradually destroys vision in the center of the visual field due to progressive damage of the retina.7
PartnerIn March 2010, we and GSK entered into a preferred partner alliance that provides GSK an option to develop and commercialize IONIS-FB-LRx. We are responsible for development of this program up to Phase 2 proof-of-concept, at which time GSK has the exclusive option to license the drug.  We are also eligible to receive double-digit royalties on sales of IONIS-FB-LRx.

 Metabolic Metabolic disorders are chronic diseases that affect millions of people. There is still a significant need for new therapies for these patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes affects more than 29 million people in the United States, or nine percent of the population, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 to 95 percent of those cases.
Metabolic disease is a very large area of medical need and is another area in which we focus our drug discovery and development efforts. Our approach is to develop antisense drugs that doctors can add to existing therapies to treat diabetes. One hurdle for traditional drug development is that most traditional drugs cannot selectively target a disease-causing protein without also affecting closely related proteins, which often results in unwanted side effects. We design our antisense drugs to target the gene responsible for producing the disease-causing protein while avoiding unwanted effects on closely related proteins, thereby reducing the risk of side effects.
We have reported positive Phase 2 data from IONIS-GCGRRx and IONIS-PTP1BRx, the most advanced drugs in our metabolic franchise. These two drugs and our third drug, IONIS-GCCRRx, are designed to act upon targets in the liver or fat tissue through a distinct mechanism to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce glucose production, or affect other metabolic aspects of this complex disease.DrugTargetPartnerIndicationP1P2P3C

IONIS-GCGRRxGCGR-DiabetesGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: Type 2 Diabetes

Description/Summary:
IONIS-GCGRRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of glucagon receptors, or GCGR, to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.  GCGR is a receptor for the hormone glucagon.  Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, particularly in type 2 diabetes. In patients with advanced diabetes, uncontrolled glucagon action can lead to significant increase in blood glucose level.  In addition, reducing GCGR produces more active glucagon-like peptide, or GLP-1, a hormone that preserves pancreatic function and enhances insulin secretion.

Clinical Data 
In January 2017, we reported results from the Phase 2 dose optimization study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in 79 patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on stable, maximal metformin therapy. In this study, patients treated with IONIS-GCGRRx achieved robust and sustained, statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other measures of glucose control after 26 weeks of treatment.  Patients treated with 50 mg and 75 mg weekly doses achieved mean reductions in HbA1c of 0.7 percentage points (p < 0.05) and 1.4 percentage points (p < 0.001) from baseline, respectively, compared to a reduction of 0.1 percentage points for placebo-treated patients, in an intent to treat (ITT) analysis. IONIS-GCGRRx-treated patients experienced a mean increase in total GLP-1 from baseline compared to a decline in placebo-treated patients.  IONIS-GCGRRx was generally safe and well tolerated in the study.

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

In May 2014, we reported data from a Phase 2 study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on stable metformin therapy at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions. In this study, patients treated with 100mg and 200mg weekly doses of IONIS-GCGRRx achieved significant reductions in measures of glucose control after only 13 weeks of treatment. In addition, IONIS-GCGRRx-treated patients experienced increased plasma GLP-1 levels.  The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-GCGRRx in the Phase 2 study supports continued development.  

For more information on the results of this study, please see our press release here. 

Current Status 
We have completed two Phase 2 studies with IONIS-GCGRRx: 1) a 13-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on stable metformin therapy and 2) a 26-week study to identify the optimal dose and schedule to achieve glucose control with manageable glucagon receptor-related liver enzyme elevations. 

We are now evaluating partnership opportunities for IONIS-GCGRRx.
 
About Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the blood glucose levels are too high. Although glucose is an important source of energy for your body and is vital to your health, uncontrolled increases in glucose can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes. Diabetes is separated in type 1 and type 2.  In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin.  In type 2 diabetes, the more common type, the body does not make or use insulin well and therefore, blood glucose levels are not regulated properly.   

Diabetes is an epidemic that continues to grow at an alarming rate.  According to the latest Center for Disease Control statistics released, there are currently 29 million people in the U.S. that have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 to 95 percent of those cases.  Moreover, an additional 86 million American adults, or one out of every three adults, are prediabetic.  It is estimated that 15 to 30 percent of prediabetic people will develop full-fledged metabolic disorder within five years.

AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRxANGPTL3AkceaNAFLD/Metabolic ComplicationsGen. 2.0+ LICA-conjugated antisense drug

Indication*:Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Metabolic Complications

Description/Summary:AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a Generation 2+ ligand conjugated antisense (LICA) drug designed to reduce angiopoietin-like 3 protein, or ANGPTL3. Studies have shown that elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein are associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels and thus lower risk of heart attacks and multiple metabolic disorders. 

We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders including rare hyperlipidemias and NAFLD and metabolic complications as well as rare diseases such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). 

Clinical Data
In November 2016, at the American Heart Association Meeting, we and Akcea reported results from the initial cohort from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx has displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study.
For more information on the results of this Phase 1/2 study, please see our press release here.
Development Plan
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is in Akcea's pipeline of novel drugs for the treatment of multiple lipid disorders. Akcea plans to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2 study and then conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with hyperlipidemia with metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver, including patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Akcea also plans to conduct a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. 

Current Status
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 study for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. 

Study Description
The Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. 

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
While some fat in the liver is normal, a significant percentage of individuals have elevated levels of liver fat. Individuals with excessive fat accumulation in the liver also have elevated risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These risks are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia, especially those with elevated triglyceride levels. The most common form of fatty liver disease is NAFLD, which is associated with obesity-related disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver, or steatosis. One of the key causes of this condition is the Western diet, which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content. In the early stages of NAFLD, patients typically experience steatosis that is slow-progressing. Over time, a subset of these patients progress to steatohepatitis, a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD characterized by chronic inflammation and liver-cell damage, called NASH. Over time, the chronic inflammation caused by NASH can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver, known as fibrosis. As scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue, blood flow is restricted, which can lead to the loss of normal liver function, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer and ultimately liver failure. Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically for NAFLD or NASH. If the disease ultimately progresses beyond NASH, the only alternative is a liver transplant.

RG-125miR-103/107RegulusNASH in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes/Pre-DiabetesGalNAc-conjugated anti-miR oligonucleotide 
Indication*:
NASH in patients with Type 2 Diabetes/Pre-Diabetes

Description/Summary:
RG-125, also referred to as AZD4076, is a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-103/107, or miR-103/107, for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes.  The role of miR-103/107 in insulin sensitivity and resistance was first recognized by the laboratory of Dr. Markus Stoffel, Professor of the Institute of Molecular Health Sciences at ETH Zurich.  Regulus reported that inhibition of miR-103/107 with anti-miRs led to a sustained reduction in fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels in mouse models.

In December 2015, Regulus completed a technology transfer to AstraZeneca and has no further obligations to AstraZeneca for future development of RG-125.  That same month, AstraZeneca commenced clinical development of RG-125 by initiating a Phase 1 study evaluating RG-125 (AZD4076) in healthy volunteers.

In the third quarter of 2016, AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 1/2a, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in subjects with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

AstraZeneca is responsible for all future development for RG-125.

IONIS-DGAT2RxDGAT2-NASHGeneration 2+ antisense drug
Indication*: NASH (Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis)

Description/Summary:IONIS-DGAT2Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to reduce the production of DGAT2, or diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, to treat patients with NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  NASH is a common liver disease characterized by excessive triglycerides in the liver with concurrent inflammation and cellular damage. DGAT2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis in the liver.  Reducing the production of DGAT2 should therefore decrease triglyceride synthesis in the liver.  In animal studies, antisense inhibition of DGAT2 significantly improved liver steatosis, lowered blood lipid levels and reversed diet-induced insulin resistance in animal models of obesity and fatty liver disease. [3,5]

NASH is sometimes considered a "silent" liver disease because people with early-stage NASH feel well, even though they are starting to accumulate fat in their livers, and may not be aware that they have the disease.  However, NASH can develop into more severe diseases such as liver cirrhosis and liver failure.  Currently, liver transplant is the only therapeutic option for patients with liver cirrhosis.  In addition, NASH has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer. 

Current StatusIn November 2016, we announced the completion of a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of IONIS-DGAT2Rx in healthy overweight volunteers (body mass index between 29 and 38 kg/m2).  NASH is most commonly found in persons who are overweight or obese.  This study in overweight subjects was designed to give us valuable insights on the effects of IONIS-DGAT2Rx in a patient population who are closely matched to patients with NASH. In this study, volunteers received doses of up to 300 mg/week, administered for 6 weeks. The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-DGAT2Rx as demonstrated in this study supports continued development.

About NASHNASH is a liver disease characterized by the presence of excessive liver fat (steatosis) that is accompanied by inflammation and cellular damage.  NASH is considered a "silent" liver disease because in the early stages of the disease, patients generally feel well and are unaware they have the disease.  However, as NASH progresses, scarring, or fibrosis, begins to accumulate in the liver.  Ultimately, cirrhosis of the liver develops and the liver can no longer function normally.  About 20 percent of NASH patients are reported to develop cirrhosis, and 30 to 40 percent of patients with NASH cirrhosis experience liver-related death. [4] Currently, liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Because of the high prevalence of NASH, it has recently become the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the US. [2] The exact cause of NASH is not well understood but the development of fatty liver diseases has been linked to obesity.  As the number of people with obesity continues to rise globally, a parallel increase in the incidence of NASH has also been observed. Currently, it is estimated that 2 to 3 percent of the general population have NASH. [1]  However, with the growing obesity epidemic, it is likely that the number of patients with NASH will also continue to rise.

Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IONS) (known as Isis Pharmeceuticals until December 2015)[1] is a publicly traded pharmaceutical company based in Carlsbad, California, United States. The company was founded in 1989 by Stanley Crooke, a former GlaxoSmithKline head of research, with a goal to commercialize antisense therapy.[2]
The company received its first FDA approval for an investigational new drug application in 1992, marking the first time any antisense drug was approved to be tested in humans; the IND was for Isis' genital warts drug candidate.[3]
The company and others founded to bring antisense drugs to market faced early failures; Isis' lead compound for genital warts failed in clinical trials and Isis terminated development in 1995; by that time two other companies working on antisense, Gilead Sciences and Genta had left the field, leaving Isis, Hybridon, and Lynx Therapeutics working in the field.[4] Gilead sold the patents it had developed around antisense to Isis.[5]
In December 2015 Isis changed its name to Ionis, driven in part by the negative image of "Isis" generated by the terrorist group, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, commonly known as ISIL or ISIS.[1][6]
Drug pipeline[edit]
The company's first marketed drug was fomivirsen (Vitravene) which was used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV) in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS.[7] It was discovered at the NIH and was licensed and initially developed by Isis, which subsequently licensed it to Novartis.[8] It was approved by the FDA for CMV in Aug 1998, and was the first antisense drug that was approved.[9] Novartis withdrew the marketing authorization in the EU in 2002[10] and in the US in 2006.[11] The drug was withdrawn because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with AIDS, the development of HAART dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV.[8]
The antisense field anticipated that the approval of fomivirsen marked the beginning of a new age of antisense drug treatments, that would be similar to the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapy, but the next FDA approval of an antisense drug came in 2013.[9] Part of what held up Isis and other companies in the field, was the way that the oligomers were chemically treated to make them into drugs which prevented some hydrolysis but also reduced affinity to the antisense molecules' targets; around 2004 the field was shifting to second generation modifications.[12] Clinical trials of antisense therapeutics by Isis and others in the early 2000s were also plagued by lack of efficacy and immune reactions to drug candidates.[13] Isis had to cut its workforce by 40% in 2005 due to weak sales of fomivirsen and lack of confidence by the market in antisense technology.[14]
In 2007 Isis and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on RNA interference, partnered to form a 50/50 joint venture, Regulus Therapeutics, to apply their intellectual property and know-how around oligomer biotherapeutics to micro-RNA targets.[15]
In 2008 Isis and Genzyme entered into a partnership agreement for the drug candidate mipomersen (Kynamro), intended to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other drug candidates; the deal included Genzyme buying $150M of Isis stock and paying a $175M license fee, as well as milestone fees and royalties.[16] Mipomersen was rejected by the European Medicines Agency in 2012[17] and again in 2013;[18] it was approved by the FDA in 2013.[9] In January 2016 Ionis terminated its arrangement with Genzyme, stating that the drug had been poorly marketed.[19] In May 2016 Ionis licensed the rights to mipomersen to Kastle Therapeutics; Kastle paid Ionis $15 million upfront with another $10 million due in May 2019, up to $70 million in milestones based on sales, and royalties, and Ionis has to pay 3% royalty and 3% of non-cash royalty it receives to Genzyme.[20] As of December 2016 mipomersen had still not been approved in Europe, and the drug had still been poorly marketed.[13]
In December 2016, Ionis' drug nusinersen (Spinraza) was approved by the FDA.[21] It had been discovered in a collaboration between Adrian Krainer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Ionis (then Isis)[22][23][13][24] and preclinical work was done at University of Massachusetts.[25] The drug was initially developed by Ionis, which partnered with Biogen on development starting in 2012, and in 2015 Biogen acquired an exclusive license to the drug for a $75 million license fee, milestone payments up to $150M, and tiered royalties between 10 and 15% thereafter; Biogen also paid for all development subsequent to taking the license.[26] The license to Biogen included licenses to intellectual property that Ionis had acquired from Cold Spring Harbor and University of Massachusetts.[27]
As of December 2016, Ionis had ten candidates for various liver diseases in clinical trials and a drug it discovered, alicaforsen, was in a Phase III trial run by another company.[13] It also had a huntingtin-lowering antisense molecule for Huntington's disease in the clinic as well.[28]

CARLSBAD, Calif., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS) announced today that it will host a live webcast on Tuesday, August 8 at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its second quarter 2017 financial results and report on pipeline and business progress.
http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151221/317736LOGO
Interested parties may listen to the call by dialing 877-443-5662 or access the webcast at www.ionispharma.com. A webcast replay will be available for a limited time at the same address.
ABOUT IONIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.Ionis is the leading company in RNA-targeted drug discovery and development focused on developing drugs for patients who have the highest unmet medical needs, such as those patients with severe and rare diseases. Using its proprietary antisense technology, Ionis has created a large pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class drugs, with over three dozen drugs in development. SPINRAZA(®) (nusinersen) is a drug that has been approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients. Biogen is responsible for commercialization of SPINRAZA. Drugs that have successfully completed Phase 3 studies include volanesorsen, a drug Ionis is developing and plans to commercialize through its affiliate, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat patients with either familial chylomicronemia syndrome or familial partial lipodystrophy; and inotersen (IONIS-TTR(Rx)), a drug Ionis is developing with GSK to treat patients with TTR amyloidosis. Both drugs are progressing toward regulatory filings in the second half of 2017. Ionis' patents provide strong and extensive protection for its drugs and technology. Additional information about Ionis is available at www.ionispharma.com.
IONIS' FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTThis press release includes forward-looking statements regarding Ionis Pharmaceuticals' financial position and outlook, Ionis' business, the business of Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and the therapeutic and commercial potential of Ionis' technologies and products in development, including SPINRAZA, IONIS-TTR(Rx) and volanesorsen. Any statement describing Ionis' goals, expectations, financial or other projections, intentions or beliefs is a forward-looking statement and should be considered an at-risk statement. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, particularly those inherent in the process of discovering, developing and commercializing drugs that are safe and effective for use as human therapeutics, and in the endeavor of building a business around such drugs. Ionis' forward-looking statements also involve assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove correct, could cause its results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although Ionis' forward-looking statements reflect the good faith judgment of its management, these statements are based only on facts and factors currently known by Ionis. As a result, you are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These and other risks concerning Ionis' programs are described in additional detail in Ionis' annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC. Copies of these and other documents are available from the Company.
In this press release, unless the context requires otherwise, "Ionis," "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refers to Ionis Pharmaceuticals and its subsidiaries.

CARLSBAD, Calif., Dec. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:   ISIS) today announced that the company has changed its name to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Ionis (pronounced "eye-OH-nis") Pharmaceuticals is an original name that the Company has chosen to represent its innovative culture and heritage as both the pioneer and leader in the RNA-targeted therapeutic space for the past 26 years.  Ionis is focused on bringing its late-stage Phase 3 drugs, nusinersen, volanesorsen and IONIS-TTRRx to the market and advancing its pipeline of high value drugs that have the potential to be first-in-class or best-in-class drugs to treat patients with life-threatening or serious diseases. 
"Our goal is to create medicines that will save patients' lives, and we are proud to be at the forefront of creating innovative medicines," said Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer at Ionis Pharmaceuticals.  "We decided to change our company name because, when people see or hear our name, we want them to think about the life-saving medicines we are developing." 
In conjunction with the corporate name change, the Company will trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the new ticker symbol "IONS". The new ticker symbol will become effective at the open of the market on December 22, 2015. In addition, the Company will have a new website address:  www.ionispharma.com.
ABOUT IONIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
Ionis is the leading company in RNA-targeted drug discovery and development focused on developing drugs for patients who have the highest unmet medical needs, such as those patients with severe and rare diseases.  Using its proprietary antisense technology, Ionis has created a large pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class drugs, with over a dozen drugs in mid- to late-stage development.  Drugs currently in Phase 3 development include volanesorsen, a drug Ionis is developing and plans to commercialize through its wholly owned subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome and familial partial lipodystrophy; IONIS-TTRRx, a drug Ionis is developing with GSK to treat patients with all forms of TTR amyloidosis; and nusinersen, a drug Ionis is developing with Biogen to treat infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy.  Ionis' patents provide strong and extensive protection for its drugs and technology.  
IONIS' FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT
This press release includes forward-looking statements regarding Ionis Pharmaceuticals' business and the therapeutic and commercial potential of Ionis' technologies and products in development, including nusinersen, IONIS-TTRRx and volanesorsen.  Any statement describing Ionis' goals, expectations, financial or other projections, intentions or beliefs is a forward-looking statement and should be considered an at-risk statement.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, particularly those inherent in the process of discovering, developing and commercializing drugs that are safe and effective for use as human therapeutics, and in the endeavor of building a business around such drugs.  Ionis' forward-looking statements also involve assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove correct, could cause its results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Although Ionis' forward-looking statements reflect the good faith judgment of its management, these statements are based only on facts and factors currently known by Ionis.  As a result, you are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements.  These and other risks concerning Ionis' programs are described in additional detail in Ionis' annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC.  Copies of these and other documents are available from the Company.
In December, 2015, the Company changed its name from Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  In this press release, unless the context requires otherwise, "Ionis," "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refers to Ionis Pharmaceuticals and its subsidiaries.
