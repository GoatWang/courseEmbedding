            Dr. John D. Currid is Professor of Old Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. He has a PhD in archaeology and has authored several commentaries (e.g. The Pentateuch, Habakkuk). In his introduction, Dr. Currid breaks up the book of Ruth into five sections: Part oneÃ¢â¬âSetting the scene (1:1-5), Part twoÃ¢â¬âNaomi and her Moabite daughter-in-laws (1:6-22), Part threeÃ¢â¬âIn the fields of Bethlehem (2:1-23), Part fourÃ¢â¬âThe scene at the Threshing Floor (3:1-18) and Part fiveÃ¢â¬âRedemption (4:1-22). These sections encompass the majority of the commentaries' brief 136 pages. Also, the introduction contains the author's valuable thesis statement, "Thus the book is serving a greater purpose than merely being a moral story of human goodness: it points to the future reality of the coming King".


I would label Professor Currid's commentary somewhere between an exegetical commentary and a devotional one. To be clear, both elements are beautifully integrated throughout. The exegetical component is not only seen in the author's commitment to the literary / historical context but also in his detailed explanation of key words and phrases of each verse. As to the devotional feature, Currid incorporates in each chapter the orthopraxical Points to Ponder, which helps the reader be not just Ã¢â¬Ëa hearer of the Word, but also a doer' (James 1:22).


For those readers who love Reformation history, you are in for a treat. Every chapter is woven with either Puritan anecdotes or quotes from the spiritual giants of previous times. Admittedly, Dr. Currid's affection for the past may not connect the young or modern reader, but what else would you expect from a professor who received his doctorate in archeology, the study of old stuff?


One of the most important concepts of the book of Ruth is the goel (Heb.) which means literally, kinsman-redeemer. Here Dr. Currid is at his literary best. His clear, engaging exegesis of this Israelite societal provision is eye-opening. In just three pages, the author describes the four duties of the goel, which all revolve around the concept of redemption. Though most readers will automatically perceive the link to the coming Messiah, Currid leaves no room for blindness and states, "Jesus claims (in Luke 4) to be the one who will bring release and liberty to His people; He is the goel for the believer" (p. 92).


Criticism


If you were to ask any pastor or scholar, "What is the most provocative part of Ruth?", the answer is always, "The scene of the threshing floor, of course!" This scene is the apex, the crescendo of the story. Ruth, by the advice of Naomi (her mother-in-law), dolls herself up and sneaks into the bed of Boaz and lies down at his feet. Provocative, indeed!


Dr. Currid argues strongly that not only was this act culturally appropriate, but there was no sexual activity between Ruth and Boaz. He does admit that the term "uncover" is often used to describe sexual activity in the OT, but the connection to Boaz's feet speaks to redemption, not sexual conduct. He states on page 104, Ruth Ã¢â¬Ëis asking that Boaz would be willing to take her under his redemptive wings to protect her__the placing of the blanket over her is symbolic of that protection and security'. Though I agree with the author's conclusion, I think this issue required direct interaction with those views critical of his, of which he did not do.


Finally, I continue to be unsettled with the need for Ruth's nightly encounter with Boaz. Dr. Currid gives no cultural precedence for such an interaction and his application of Ezekiel 16, though original to this reviewer, is not convincing. I am left wondering if Naomi's advice reveals impatience, rather than godly discretion.


Conclusion


In my opinion, this resource is a wonderful addition to the short list of Ruthian commentaries. Currid's work is brief, readable and from the reformed tradition (though it doesn't feel that way). If you are just starting to build your library, I would start with this work.


Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Cross Focused Reviews as part of their Blogger Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.

            Would you like a really suggestive commentary on the Book of Ruth? Then you simply must pick up "Ruth: From Bitter To Sweet" by John Currid and published by EP Books in the helpful Welwyn Commentary Series. I had heard good things on his Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, but somehow had never gotten around to picking them up. So I was excited to get this volume on Ruth. I wasn't disappointed.


The book is especially helpful for the pastor or Bible teacher though it is written in an accessible manner that could benefit anyone. The 4 chapters of Ruth are covered in 12 chapters here that would pretty much be divided along the lines one might want to preach.


It is not as much a typological commentary as many of the popular volumes on Ruth are, and though I personally do see real typology in Ruth myself, this volume is a worthy aid in working through Ruth. He still writes much of Christ and gives much help on the narrative itself. He works out details, gives exceptionally good help on word meanings without being overly technical, and has nice illustrations from Scripture and history that really brings the text alive.


I have all the well-known volumes on Ruth and am glad to let this book take a prominent place beside. I think I need to get those other volumes by Mr. Currid too.


I received this book free from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.

From Humble Beginnings To A National Brand. 
But We Never Forget What’s Really Important.
In 2004, we opened a small chocolate factory in Hollywood. All we had was determination and a recipe for an amazing, gourmet chocolate fudge. Now we are a national brand, but we still work hard every day to make products that are unique and special.

Truffle Fudge:  Think Ganache Coated In Chocolate, But With A Unique Twist.
What is truffle fudge? It’s something completely different. It has a silky chocolate center with the consistency of ganache, as well as a chocolate coating, and you may think it’s a truffle. But it’s not. It’s actually fudge, just not like any fudge you’ve tasted before.

*Order includes an instant download of the release. 
Featuring former members of Daniel Striped Tiger, Four Eyes and Lost Twin, Sweet John Bloom first took form in the Spring of 2013. The band recorded their debut EP as a trio shortly after but later expanded to a four piece before recording their debut full-length, Weird Prayer. Recorded with Justin Pizzoferrato (Dinosaur Jr, Speedy Ortiz, California X) and Seth Manchester (Battles, Fang Island, The Body) during the Summer and Fall of 2014, Weird Prayer expands and evolves Sweet John Bloom's brand of punk rock. Clocking in at 15 songs and 35 minutes the band truly runs the gamut between indie rock, power pop and punk pop. Diverse yet completely unified as a whole, Weird Prayer is a debut LP to be reckoned with and marks Sweet John Bloom as a band you need to know in 2015.

SweetPro introduces EquiLix PI – Performance Intake
Performance horses, work horses and horses that need to increase their daily intake of vitamins and minerals now have EquiLix PI – Performance Intake. 
EquiLix PI has the same "all-in-one" vitamin and mineral supplemention as the standard blue tub EquiLix but it's formulated for higher intake so horses get more than the 1 lb per day / per horse consumed with the standard EquiLix. 

  EquiLix PI includes strong prebiotic and digestive aids for better horse health and superior performance and works effectively to help support hooves, hair coat, joint lubricity, feed utilization, circulation and resistance to colicing.

EquiLix PI promotes higher consumption than the standard blue tub EquiLix. It's perfect for competition and work horses, donkeys and mules, or for picky eaters. Use daily for horses along with good forages. 
Set the 50 lb tub out for 1-2 horses, or the 125 lb tub out for 4-5 horses.

Billings, Montana – April 7, 2016
    As livestock owners have become more sophisticated in their understanding of livestock nutrition and nutrient requirements, supplements have become an increasingly popular management tool to help cattle better utilize their feed particularly in the winter when the available forages are lacking needed nutrients. Supplements provide an easy method for delivering protein, energy, minerals and vitamins to their cattle. Higher molasses prices and the option of non-molasses supplement blocks are giving stock contractors and cattle ranchers a reason to reevaluate the type of supplement they use.
