Alex MannContact Reporter




A man armed with a knife wanted in connection with a string of commercial robberies in northern and western Anne Arundel County struck again Tuesday, robbing a gas station in Glen Burnie, county police said.Witnesses told police the man entered the Citgo gas station at 7237 Ritchie Highway Tuesday about 10:15 p.m., shopped around, put several items on the counter and walked out of the store before re-entering. He displayed a knife and demanded money from the store manager, said Marc Limansky, police spokesman.The manager complied, handing over the register's contents. The robber took the contents and fled with an undetermined amount of money, police said.Based on the description of the robber and his actions, Limansky said investigators believe it is the same man who has robbed several other gas stations and convenience stores in the last month.

The man is suspected of robbing a BP gas station in Odenton, a 7-Eleven in Pasadena, two Exxon stations in Hanover and Glen Burnie and a Capital One Bank in Glen Burnie.The man did not display a knife in all of the robberies, Limansky said. But police urged the public to be cautious and call 911 if they spot the man. He was last seen wearing a gray polo shirt, black sweatpants and red baseball hat."If you see the subject do not approach him," he said.Limansky said police have received a few "loose" tips. Anyone with information on the robberies can call 410-222-4720.
