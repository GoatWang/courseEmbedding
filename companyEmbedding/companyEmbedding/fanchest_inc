’47 New York Giants Short Sleeve T-Shirt – Value $38.00 
I can’t find this shirt online but the price tag that’s attached says $38.00. I’m so happy that it’s 100% cotton. I find those shirts hold up much better being washed and dried than cotton/poly blends. I like the V-neck too; I think that it makes it more feminine. 

NFL Drawstring Backpack – Value $19.13 
This drawstring nylon backpack is about 19 by 14 inches. It is lightweight and durable, printed with the NY Giants logo. This is perfect for when you’re traveling light and need your hands free.

NFL ’47 Clean Up Adjustable Hat – Value $16.93
This 100% cotton hat is adjustable with a metal buckle. I like that the blue is a very slightly faded look giving it an already broken-in appearance. The NY Giants logo is simple and classic. To me this is the perfect Giants hat, too bad my hubby already claimed it!

City Prints Metlife Stadium Coasters – Value $5.00?
City Prints is a family run company in Charlotte, North Carolina and they are known for making art from city, campus and stadium maps. I couldn’t find these exact coasters for sale because the only ones on their website are made of wood and these seem to be made of a plastic material.
Eye Black Strips – Value $1.00?
Eye Black adhesive stickers help combat sun glare. These stickers look like they were custom made for Fanchest because I don’t see them for sale on the Eye Black website. I think they are a cool addition to the Fanchest in Giants’ team colors.


NFL NYG Mystery Minifigure by OYO Sports – Value $14.99
Our mystery mini-figure was Victor Cruz and we are big fans of his so this was a great collectible to receive. This mini-figure is Lego compatible and comes with his own little stand if you wish to keep it on display. I love the jersey with his name and number and his little football. 
Verdict: I love my Giants Fanchest! I feel like the value is fabulous because officially licensed gear isn’t cheap. The value for this chest is over $95 which I think is great. For me, the shirt and hat alone make this box worth the cost and everything else is just an added bonus! I know so many sports fans in my life who would love to receive one of these chests as a gift. I’m happy to see more teams have been added since the spring. 
What do you think of Fanchest? Any teams you’re hoping to see them feature?

Written by Jessica Telesmanich

Jessica’s addiction started off slowly enough with Birchbox, but it has grown and grown over the last three years. An elementary school librarian and mom of two she loves boxes that are child-centric. But she’ll never turn down a good fashion, beauty or tasty treat subscription.





All views in this review are the opinion of the author. My Subscription Addiction will never accept payment in exchange for a review, but will accept a box at no cost to provide honest opinions on the box. This post may contain affiliate/referral links.

Aw man…Thought you found me the perfect Bday gift for my brother and then realized they don’t do DA BEARS  :/  I hope they plan to expand to other franchises soon!

Thank you for the review! Just ordered a Patriots box for my boyfriend. It’s perfect because his favorite sports brand of clothing is 47. Also I was prompted to enter my email address to save 10% off my purchase.
