About The Firm
My Biography



About the Firm

Firm Overview

		I have appeared in Federal Court in Shreveport and Monroe. For state court I have primarily practiced in Shreveport City Court, Caddo Parish, Bossier City Court and Bossier Parish. I have also been in DeSoto, Red River, Winn, Natchitoches, Webster, Arcadia, Claiborne, Lincoln, Ouachita, Richland, Rapides, and Franklin parishes. I have even gone as far as St. Bernard and Orleans Parishes. When necessary, I have appealed cases with success.

No Fee Guarantee:
In personal injury cases, we do not charge any attorney fee or any expenses unless you win. You already have medical bills, a damaged car, and time off from work. You need help - not more bills. We only make a recovery if you do.

In criminal cases the fee is based on the complexity of the case. Please call for a quote.

Call us at 318-626-7300 or send an email. We will meet with you, review what happened to you, and make recommendations about what to do next.

Assistance with Medical Treatment
We will assist you in obtaining medical treatment if you need help. Many doctors will not see even their regular patients if they believe litigation may occur. Don't go without treatment just because your doctor doesn't want to be involved.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.
