 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fairmount Santrol’s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today’s call, Indrani Egleston, Senior Director of Investor Relations and FP&A for Fairmount Santrol. Please go ahead, Indrani.
Indrani Egleston
Thank you, Carol. Good morning and welcome to Fairmount Santrol's First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. With us today are Jenniffer Deckard, our CEO and President; and Michael Biehl, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Before turning the call over to Jenniffer and Michael, we would like to remind all participants that certain statements during this call may constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For a complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, we encourage you to read the press release and our documents on file with the SEC.
We would also like to remind you that during this call, we will comment on non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA. These financial measures are used by management to monitor and evaluate the ongoing performance of the company and to allocate resources. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP results as an attachment to our first quarter earnings release, which we issued this morning.
Now to begin, here is our CEO and President, Jenniffer Deckard.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thanks, Indrani, and good morning, everyone. In case you haven't yet had the pleasure to meet her, Indrani recently assumed the Fairmount Santrol IR leadership role from Sharon Van Zeeland. Michael and I would personally like to thank Sharon for the critical role she played in building our Investor Relations function over the past several years.
Indrani's background is in finance and she has worked closely with the IR team throughout her time here at Fairmount. In addition to our Investor Relationship role, she'll also retain her current leadership responsibility for Fairmount Santrol FP&A function. We're confident that Indrani will do a great job in her new role, and we will all appreciate working directly with both, her and Matt Schlarb.
With that, thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Fairmount Santrol.
I'll begin this morning's call with a high-level overview of our first quarter performance and the more color on demand within both of our 2 segments. And then Michael will cover the financials in greater detail. I'll conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook for the second quarter along with some perspectives on market conditions and a few other key focus areas for Fairmount Santrol.
Following my comments, we'll be happy to answer your questions.
We're pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. Total company volumes and sales were in line with the outlook we shared in mid-March with profitability that was moderately higher than our outlook, due mainly to strong sales of value-added products in March.

Continued improvement in our Proppant Solutions segment, coupled with continued solid results of our I&R segment, led to total company volumes of 2.7 million tons or 10% sequential growth. This overall volume growth, combined with stronger frac sand pricing and a higher percentage of sales within our value-added product lines contributed to revenues of $172.6 million or a 23% sequential growth.
Accordingly, our profitability improved during the quarter with adjusted EBITDA totaling $21.7 million, as improved pricing and fixed cost leverage further contributed to improved profit level.
Moving to our segment performance. Let's begin with the results from our Proppant Solutions business. Demand was up across our full product portfolio. Total Proppant Solutions volumes were 2.1 million tons, up 13% over the prior quarter. Overall demand for frac sand remains strong with most grades of frac sand sold out during the first quarter.
Frac sand volume of 1.9 million tons were up 10% sequentially, driven largely by additional demand for coarser grade as capacity constraints for finer grades persisted, and as inherent well design helped to fuel growth in our coarser-grade products. Higher proppant production at our Menomonie facility along with limited production during the ramp-up of our Brewer and Maiden Rock facilities, also allowed us to increase our effective capacity during the first quarter and contributed modestly to our volume growth. Value-added proppants had a very strong quarter with volumes totaling 161,000 tons, a 59% increase over fourth quarter volume of 101,000 tons, with strength in both resin-coated proppant and Propel SSP. Historically, our resin-coated volumes are highly correlated to rig count changes, often with a few months lag. Thus far, this trend has held true, although we believe that some of the increase resin demand we saw in the first quarter was also covering a pent-up demand from the fourth quarter, during which time our customers faced year-end budget constraints as well as other seasonal factors.
We've seen a particularly strong increasing demand for our curable resin-coated products. We attribute some of this growth to an increased interest in preventing proppant flowback in the well in order to keep completions equipment running more efficiently, which is increasingly important as availability of equipment and crude has become tighter.
Sequential SSP growth was also high. In addition to the inherent gains in well productivity when using Propel, both pumping time and water usage is typically reduced by 50% of that which is needed to play similar proppant volume within a slickwater well design, again, addressing equipment and crew efficiencies.
Pricing also improved as expected during the quarter, with raw frac sand prices increasing by over $4 per ton on average. We expect FOB mine volume to make up a slightly higher percentage of overall volume in the coming quarters, as we ramp-up operations at our Brewer and Maiden Rock facilities, which will likely have a higher mix of FOB mine sales based on customer preferences and commitments.
Turning to our I&R segment. Total volumes were 595,000 tons, up 1% over both the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2016. Demand was solid across all product lines with particular strength in our value-added products. We were pleased that these relatively flat overall tons were leveraged for nice uplift in profitability. We expect solid performance from our I&R segment to continue in the second quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to cover the financials in more detail.
Michael Biehl
Thanks, Jenniffer, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus on – primarily on sequential comparisons over the fourth quarter of 2016, which we believe were more relevant, given the current market dynamics and trends from one quarter to the next.

As Jenniffer mentioned, total company revenues for the quarter were $172.6 million, in line with our outlook we have provided and up 23% sequentially. Proppant Solutions revenues were $141 million for the first quarter of 2016, up 24% compared to the fourth quarter. Improved pricing, as Jenniffer noted, and higher volumes, particularly in our coated proppants were the main contributors to revenue growth remained capacity constraint across most grades, especially in finer grades. Industrial and Recreational revenue was $31.6 million for the first quarter 2017, up 17% compared to fourth quarter of 2016, and up 13% versus the first quarter of 2016.
The increase in revenues was due in part for price increases instituted at the beginning of the year as well as an increase in our value-added product sales, particularly in our recreation and building product lines. The company's consolidated gross profit was $40.8 million in the first quarter, or 23.7% of sales, up from $28.3 million or 20.1% of sales in the fourth quarter.
Gross profit for the Proppant Solutions segment was $27.3 million in the first quarter or roughly $13 per ton compared with $17.1 million in the fourth quarter or $9 per ton.
The sequential gross profit improvement in the Proppant Solutions business is largely attributed to volume growth in both raw and coated proppants and pricing improvements, offset somewhat by higher rail rates, normal seasonal factors due to colder weather and cost associated with restart of our Brewer and Maiden Rock facilities.
As Brewer and Maiden Rock increased their production, our average manufacturing cost per ton will increase moderately, however improved fixed cost leverage and lower excess railcar cost will help to offset this increase in production cost. So expect cost per ton to remain relatively flat to up slightly in the second quarter.
Our improved cost position from higher volumes and lower excess railcar cost will offset higher production costs from reactivated plants, including startup cost at Maiden Rock and Brewer, which will reoccur at about the same level as what was spent in the first quarter.
Railcar storage totaled approximately 1,300 at the end of the first quarter, down from 2,950 at the end of 2016. Excess railcar costs for the first quarter were $4.2 million or $2 per ton. As we previously stated, there is onetime cost associated with pulling railcars out of storage, which somewhat offset the benefits of having fewer cars in storage in the first quarter. However, excess railcar cost still decreased by $1.7 million or $1.15 per ton.
We currently have less than 800 cars in storage, and we expect to have all our cars back in service by the end of the second quarter.
Since we expect that we'll be pulling so many cars out of storage in the second quarter, we'll incur more onetime cost in the quarter, but still expect excess railcar cost per ton to decrease. By the third quarter, we believe excess railcar costs will be 0.
As we look longer term of each of our 2016 renegotiations with our railcar suppliers is that we have the ability to pull forward some railcar deliveries, if necessary, that are currently scheduled for 2020 and 2021. We also expect to utilize customer cars to better maximize the efficiency of our fleet. Further improved use of our unit train capabilities allows us to turn cars faster within our railcar fleet.
Our I&R segment's gross profit for the fourth quarter was $13.5 million, a 30% increase from comparable 2016 first quarter gross profit of $10.4 million, due mainly to the benefit from higher prices across the entire segment in greater volumes and our recreation and building products, value-added product lines, coupled with cost per ton improvements from higher efficiencies and fixed cost leverage.

Gross margin percentage for I&R increased to 42.7% in the first quarter versus 41.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 37.2% in the first quarter of 2016.
SG&A for the quarter was $22.5 million, which included $2.4 million in noncash stock compensation expense. This compares to $18.6 million of SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included $1.5 million of noncash stock compensation expense and $1.2 million of professional fees for the fourth quarter equity offerings. The increase in comparison to prior year spending is primarily driven by a higher investment in R&D and our technical sales force, which added over $1 million in expense in the first quarter and $1 million increase in short-term variable compensation and benefit plan contribution expense on our improved performance.
For the second quarter, we expect that SG&A will range between $26 million and $27 million, including noncash compensation expense – noncash stock compensation expense of approximately $3 million. We currently anticipate that this will be our SG&A run rate for the remainder of 2017, primarily due to the additional technical and R&D investments. SG&A also included a higher variable compensation due to our expected increase in performance over the year, including the expected contribution to our benefit plan – benefit plans at an annual base wage increase, both of which were suspended last year.
Interest expense in the quarter was $12.5 million, an 18% decline from $15.3 million in the fourth quarter, as a result of having the full effect of lower outstanding debt, following the debt prepayments and repurchases in the fourth quarter. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the first quarter was $19.4 million versus $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the prior quarter was driven by amortization of our Propel SSP intangible asset, as we now have fully begun commercial sales of Propel SSP in 2017.
In the first quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 million, and our effective tax rate was 9%. The decrease in the effective rate from prior periods is due to a 2016 valuation allowance against tax assets, which under accounting rules do not allow us to record a current tax benefit for our losses.
For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 4% due to the benefits noted above and due to partial reversal of the valuation allowance. We had a net loss for the first quarter of $11.6 million or $0.05 per share compared with a net loss of $19.9 million or $0.09 loss per share in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $21.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared with adjusted EBITDA of $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter excludes noncash stock compensation expense of $2.4 million, but includes $900,000 in startup cost for our Brewer and Maiden Rock mines. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter excludes noncash compensation expense of $1.5 million and income of roughly $2.4 million, which was a combination of multiple factors, including the gain on the repurchase of our debt, which was offset in part by asset impairment expenses.
The sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to higher volumes, improved pricing and the mixed shift toward value-added products in both our Proppant Solutions and Industrial and Recreational segments.
Cash flow from operations was $26 million for the first 3 months of 2017, as a result of improved operating results led by volume and pricing improvements, along with the shift mix, that I mentioned, in the value-added products.
Included in operating cash inflows for the quarter was approximately $2 million of tax refunds received in the quarter. Thus far in the second quarter, we received $16 million in tax refunds due to prior year loss carrybacks.

For the remainder of the year, we expect to receive an additional $2 million in tax refunds from prior year benefits, and we believe our excess free cash flow from operations will improve.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $7 million, primarily related to maintenance and startup of our Brewer and Maiden Rock facilities. For the full year, we continue to believe our capital expenditures will be in a range of $47 million to $50 million.
The company's debt balance at the end of the first quarter was approximately $845 million and net debt was at $634 million. All major remaining maturities are due in the third quarter of 2019, which provides us good flexibility. But we'll look to refinance these maturities during 2017 to periods beyond 2019, in addition to potentially further reducing our overall debt, as our free cash flow continues to improve.
Also, we're pleased with 2 recent upgrades to our credit ratings, including Fitch's initial credit rating of B- for the stable outlook and S&P's recent revision to B- rating with a stable outlook. A positive development from the prior B- rating with a negative outlook. This reflects the progress we've made in improving our capital structure over the past year, which we'll continue to make further enhancements to.
As of March 31, 2017, company had a cash of $211 million compared to $194 million at December 31, 2016. Total liquidity at the end of quarter was roughly $226 million, including $15.7 million of unused availability under our revolving credit facility. As a reminder, under the covenants of our bank credit agreement, the amount of available credit on this facility would increase up to $100 million less outstanding letters of credit as our EBITDA run rate improves and if we achieve a leverage ratio of 4.7x – 4.75x or less. Currently our outstanding letters of credit totaled $15.5 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jenniffer to provide more – some insight in the current market conditions as well as comments on other key focus areas.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thanks, Michael. So far in the second quarter, demand for proppant has continued to strengthen with demand for finer grades continuing to stay on the heavier side. However, demand for coarser grades is also rising due to their greater availability and to inherent well designs. This improvement in demand for coarser sand helps us to drive efficiency throughout our operation with better balance to our production mix, which both reduces the nominal cost of dumping tons as well as increases our overall cost leverage.
Given our consistently constrained capacity for finer grades, this increasing coarse-grade products also allowed us to grow our overall volumes in the first quarter and to increase our effective capacity utilization to over 90%.
U.S. rig counts have continued to rise in the second quarter and are currently around 20% above first quarter averages. This trend in rig counts is a positive indicator for raw sand demand and also for our value-added coated proppants, for which demand has also continued to increase in the second quarter, following a very strong first quarter growth. Proppant intensity per well continues to be a tailwind and we expect this to continue.
This strengthening demand, along with the recent realignment of our supply agreement, also allowed us to improve our pricing on raw frac sand at the beginning of the second quarter. We expect raw frac sand pricing will increase by an average of $7 to $9 per ton in the second quarter versus the first quarter. If market conditions continue to improve, which we currently believe will be the case, we expect to implement further price increases in the third quarter.
Given rig counts and proppant intensity trends, we estimate the annualized market demand is currently in the range of 70 million tons and will likely average around 75 million tons for 2017. Based on further industry expectations that both rig count and proppant intensity per well will continue to rise, we estimate that market demand could surpass 100 million tons in 2018. Available sand supply is currently tight, particularly for finer grades. And if forecast for 2018 demand become a reality, the market will need to bring capacity online and it will need to do so in excess of demand due to inherent grade imbalances as well as other operational considerations.

We believe the additional industry capacity that is coming online will be necessary to meet expected future demand. The capacity expansion announcements in the industry will increase production of both regional and Northern White sands. We believe both types of sand will play a meaningful role as the market continues to gain momentum. Regional sand does have cost advantages in this specific basin and will likely serve an ongoing role in the long term industry supply, particularly for those users who are more focused on shorter-term completion cost. Northern White sand plays a critical role in all basins, including those with local sand availability, including the Permian. Its quality and productivity advantages are and will continue to be important to many producers.
Additionally, regional sand production in West Texas is heavily skewed towards the finer grades, which means that even as local capacity is added, northern white sand will be important in meeting the gap between demand for specific grades and local supply in those basins. The demand that Northern White will continue to fill for all grades is even more pronounced if projections for increased Permian demand holds true.
Along the more near-term lines of tight supply to meet growing market demand, we'd like to provide an update on Fairmount's current capacity and the restart of our Brewer and Maiden Rock facilities, which we announced on our last earnings call. We're pleased to report that the ramp-up of production is progressing as planned. And we expect both facilities to be at full production capacity by the middle of the second quarter.
The combined stated capacities at these 2 facilities is 2.3 million tons, which will bring the company's total annual stated proppant capacity to 11.9 million tons. In addition to these plants startup, we've also made recent improvements at our Voca, Texas facility. Voca has a stated capacity of 1.5 million tons annually. However, the effective capacity has consistently been closer to 1 million tons, due mainly to processing constrains. We're making a small capital investment to increase the effective capacity by 200,000 tons to 300,000 tons per year, which we expect to narrow the gap between our stated and effective capacities.
We expect that project to be completed sometime in this second quarter of 2017.
Outside of these effective capacity additions, we still have approximately 2 million tons of idled annual capacity from our Hager Bay, our Shakopee and our Wexford locations that could also be activated. Should we decide to bring additional capacity online, reopening these idled facilities would be our first priority due to the lower capital investment required and the speed to market.
All of these plans will be profitable at today's pricing level. However, before we initiate reactivation of any idled facility, we would secure solid customer volume commitments to help ensure the long-term viability of these facilities.
On a topic of commitments with our customers, we'd like to discuss our long-held philosophy regarding the structure of our contracts. In addition to securing additional supply agreements over the past 3 months, we've completed a restructuring of our legacy agreement. While the individual terms vary by agreement, annual volumes are generally fixed and collectively bring balance to our product mix and stability to our volumes. This approach has served the company very well throughout industry cycle. Pricing is generally a function of market pricing, which can usually be updated quarterly depending on underlying market conditions.
And due to the recently completed restructuring starting in the second quarter, the cadence of any pricing adjustments will be more uniform across our customer base with any adjustments now being made at the beginning of any applicable quarter. This change will be helpful to both Fairmount Santrol and to our customer base in managing our commitments.

It's our observation that the terms spot pricing and market pricing are sometimes viewed interchangeably, but there is an important distinction. Spot pricing, while indicative of market direction, is generally transactional and is applicable to noncommitted and generally smaller overall volumes. While market pricing is generally determined by more representative transactions or series of transactions for similarly situated product with similar product characteristics. Our contracts structure gives us flexibility to adjust prices depending on underlying supply and demand dynamics. They do allow us to lead the market in pricing as we did with our announcement in the third quarter of 2016, as well as to follow pricing. So there will also be times that our pricing may temporarily lag spot pricing up or down. However, over time, market pricing tends to converge with spot pricing.
One other benefit of our long-term volume contracts is that the combination of our contracts generally cover the breadth of our product offerings. And so it helps us to balance and to plan our production to more effectively meet market demand. Long-term contracts also play an important role in helping us to plan for long-term capacity.
We recently expanded or added several customer contracts in order to be in line with our preference for maintaining volume commitments above 70% of effective capacities. These contract moves were completed in anticipation of reactivating both Brewer and Maiden Rock, whose production has been substantially allocated to customers with long-term contracts.
Moving to our logistics. Unit trains continue to play an increasingly important role in our network and accounted for over 70% of our Northern White volumes shipped in the first quarter. We also recently opened an additional unit train terminal, bringing us to a total of 10 unit train distribution points. We expect another unit train terminal to go into service during the third quarter of 2017.
A further benefit of unit train is that we were able to reduce cycle time and get more turns from each railcar, thus reducing the total number of cars that would otherwise be needed.
In addition to cost advantages, this will likely become a more meaningful advantage as the railcar supply-demand cycle evolves to the oil and gas upcycle. As industry demand forecast grow, we believe that our extensive logistics network will continue to be an important value-add for us and for our customers.
Another key value-add on which I'd like to provide an update is Propel SSP. We saw good growth in demand in quarter 1, as users were able to leverage Propel SSP to both gain productivity and operational efficiencies, which are valuable to both E&P and service companies. The productivity enhancements that Propel SSP provide have been well demonstrated through many trial wells in different basins over the past 2 years.
We've also spent the last several months documenting the operational efficiencies that Propel SSP can also provide, including a proven 50% reduction in water usage and pumping times versus slickwater for wells that are optimized for use of Propel SSP.
We believe these 2 areas will become a more important focus area for both operators and oilfield service companies, as production needs increase and available completion equipment and water resources become tighter.
We work closely with our partners to demonstrate Propel SSP's unique value proposition and remain upbeat on its prospects.
We'd now like to provide a little more color regarding expectations for the second quarter. We currently expect total company volumes in the second quarter to be between 3.2 million tons and 3.5 million tons and to realize an average raw sand price increase of $7 to $9 per ton over quarter 1 averages on a like basis.

Additionally, as Michael mentioned, we believe the average cost per ton in our Proppant Solutions segment will remain fairly flat to slightly up in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter, even with the startup of our Brewer and Maiden Rock mines. Demand for raw sand continues to rise, especially for fine grades and increasingly for coarser grades as well. And we expect to sell a large majority of the incremental production coming from the restart of Maiden Rock and Brewer. We also expect volume growth in our value-added products group in the second quarter. For our I&R segment, after a very strong first quarter, we expect modest year-over-year volume growth in the second quarter with solid underlying demand.
Now, Carol, could you please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question this morning comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Ole Slorer
Yeah. Hi, very good morning and congrats with very strong numbers and a good setup running into the second quarter.
Jenniffer Deckard
Good morning. 
Ole Slorer
I think it's clear here that the market isn't necessarily concerned about the ability to deliver the 100 million tons that you think the market could grow to next year. But instead getting concerned about the fact that capacity is now expanding from 75 million tons to 100 million tons, assuming that most are sold out at the time when kind of oil prices are taking a scary direction and setting us off potentially for a double-digit in activity. So, I wonder whether you could talk to the flexibility that you have with respect to the balance sheet that still has quite a lot of debt on it. And the CapEx that you committed to relative to the ability to derisk by paying down debt, if you should sort of see a different trajectory. We can all understand the bold case but could you talk us a little bit through how you're thinking about the other end of the risk curve?
Michael Biehl
Sure. Happy to do that. As we’ve indicated in all opportunities we do in September 19, so we do feel we have some time and flexibilities evaluate the actions that we have. And again our current target continues to be $500 million of net debt by the end of 2018 as we’ve previously stated. And we continue to build our cash balance and expect to generate significant free cash flow remainder of this year that could be used to further pay down our debt. So we are on course to hit that $500 million I think the ability to do it. We continue to evaluate refinancing our debt, the different opportunities that we have as are our operations improve over the year and once better faster company’s operations and also add value for shareholders.
Our CapEx range of 47 to 50 that includes maintenance CapEx between 10 million and 15 million. So if we had to scale it back, we could do that pretty rapidly and if there were certain mines that we’re in the process reopening that. There was a concern we could sales scale that back or we not open them but we believe that going to happen. We think the market’s going to continue to be strong.
Jenniffer Deckard
Yeah.
Ole Slorer 
That’s helpful. I just look through – understand the flexibility around that clearly here in the second, third quarter, you will generate ton of cash regardless. And I was just willing to, wanting you to elaborate the robustness around that relative to your refinancing requirements later in the year and clearly a significantly improved year-over-year position. Just...
Jenniffer Deckard
Ole, I would also add to that. In the event you mentioned the double digit. I think that Fairmount did an excellent job of demonstrating also our flexibility operationally in both scaling down and scaling up, that was painful. But, I think, we executed on that as well. So we also, I think, have flexibility on the operational side as well.

Ole Slorer
My second question is, this trend towards some experimentation with very fine mesh and how would that impact your business? Wouldn't that typically be the kind of product that you today sell in your industrial product lines?
Jenniffer Deckard
We're aware of the discussions around micro proppants and potential benefits that they may provide. At this point, we do believe that's still experimental and we're having conversations with the customer. I'm watching that closely. We do not currently sell, what was formerly referred to as ground silica, into the I&R markets. We actually used to do that. But in the 1980s, we discontinued all of those operations from our view of the elevated risk, tied to respirable silica, and which of course, is the leading cause of silicosis. So we went away from that with the new technologies and a focus on safety. Should that trend occur, we could produce micro proppants with a small investment at our plants. But we would just need to further that discussion to justifying the investments before we would make that move.
Ole Slorer
Okay. Thanks for that. I’ll hand it back.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thanks.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund
Well, I guess, it's a little bit of a follow-up on Ole's question. And then much better quarter than last quarter. What would it take, in your opinion for investors to understand or believe that we aren't going to according to one time I think you recently, we're going to so expand capacity that pricing is going to go to 0 and all this equity value for frac sand companies is going to be wiped out. What has to happen? What do you think investors need to see before they're convinced that that's not going to be the case? Is it just time?
Jenniffer Deckard
I think the most important thing for investors to see is a path to continue to growth on the demand side, to meet the projected growth in supply. And I think that all of the indicators thus far on proppant intensity have continued to hold, and I think, that's a positive tailwind as well. And oil prices, we can't predict them, we can only follow what the industry experts are saying. And as well as rig counts. But most of those things are continuing to increase. But we do think that given the estimates for rig counts that's just over between 1,000 and 1,100, with that type of a rig count is where we think the industry would go 100 million plus tons. So it's all dependent on rig count and proppant intensity.
Jim Wicklund
Okay. And then my follow-up, if I could. You're reopening your 2 mines, reactivating your 2 mines. That will increase your capacity. But as you noted, demand continues to be relentless in its growth, and so I would expect that in '18, Fairmount would have to either expand existing capacity or develop new mines, and of course, you had the Voca facility and we've all seen that every time someone opens a Texas mine, at some point you devalue Wisconsin. Can you talk about what perhaps the additions you think you're going to need through '18? And where might they be – do you have a strategic preference in terms of your next new mine locations?
Michael Biehl
Well, we currently have 3 idled raw fracs facilities at Shakopee, Hager Bay and Wexford, which would add around 2 million tons. And we could bring those online in 3 to 6 months with minimal investment. Shakopee is located on the UP, and it has been skewed toward the coarser grades. Hager Bay is the unit train capable plant located on the BNSF. And Wexford is a more regional sand location in Michigan. We continue to be disciplined when it comes to deploying capital and we continue to evaluate the options that really provide a complementary fit beyond our existing facilities and provide a strong return on invested capital for our shareholders.

Given the ever-changing market dynamics, our valuation is focused on both short- and long-term demand as well as options that are adjacent to our current product offerings. Obviously, whether there's an option for expansion, we have existing permitted reserves and it's a known asset for us. However, given recent trends towards the regional and local sands and a changing market dynamics, we're evaluating the best option for us longer term to meet customer demands and market needs. And we commented in the past, we have done an extensive search in the Permian Basin and continue to do so. And we'll continue to evaluate what we believe is best for us long term and for our shareholders in terms of making investments and where we expect the market to go over the next several years.
Jim Wicklund
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Please go ahead. 
Marc Bianchi 
Thank you. First question on Brewer and Maiden Rock. I guess, I'm a little bit surprised on the ramp time there. Curious if you could talk about maybe some of the challenges that you have? And perhaps the challenges for the industry in general trying to bring on capacity that might have been idled? 
Michael Biehl
As we stated previously, it takes roughly 3 to 6 months to open up these facilities. The longer timing is largely due to acquiring resources particularly capital equipment and employees to staff the plants. We've been lucky that for Brewer and Maiden Rock plants, we've had a high return of employees that exited the company in the downturn. There is a lag time to acquire capital equipment, primarily mobile equipment, which has a little bit longer lead time, but we think we've got that pretty much in place and we're ready to go. And we're making good progress on both of these facilities to have them at full capacity. And as I think we've mentioned, we did sell some capacity from those plants in the first quarter. But they are not at full capacity, yet we expect them to be at full capacity this month.
Jenniffer Deckard 
I would add to that, Michael. Just kudos to our operational team, our logistics team, our sales team, because as you mentioned, I think we hit the low side of that 3 to 6 months to full capacity. And I think we would ship within 6 weeks. So that just has to ramp up and a good deal is that we've got to bring a lot of labor and people on board and we do that prudently and carefully, and I think the operations team did a fantastic job.
Marc Bianchi 
Thanks for that. I guess, along the same lines, you've restarted Brewer and Maiden Rock slightly higher cost in Wedron. And then we've got Shokapee, Hager Bay, Wexford kind of next in line. As you look at your supply footprint and the cost curve that exists, how does that compare to what the rest of the industry has? And do you have any thoughts on what the cost curve looks like for the industry as things restart? You mentioned the $7 to $9 of price improvement, are there thresholds where you think there is a lot more supply that comes on? And could you talk to that maybe more broadly for the industry? 
Jenniffer Deckard
So I'll talk about Fairmount Santrol in that cost curve. And maybe first of all, I think that last quartile of the cost curve, that is likely active and depending on where supply comes into the market, may well remain in active. We believe that Fairmount is on the first quartile on that side of that cost curve and the rest of our plan somewhere in the second and third quartile that we want to continue on. So I believe that, that will be the dynamics. The cost curve, I think, at the far right, it's really hard to talk about the cost curve at the mine, because the importance is the river and the basin. And I think, that's where you gain the importance of unit trains being located on rail. And I think that's really what pushes many of our locations to the left of the effective cost of getting into basin.

Marc Bianchi
And Jenniffer, what would you say are – not commenting on the absolute numbers because of all the variety of variables that you mentioned, but if you think about the relative, is it a $10 difference between the low cost and the medium cost? Or is it something larger? And then between the medium cost and the high cost, just curious if you could help put some numbers around that for us?
Jenniffer Deckard
Sure. I would say low to medium. A $10 range is probably a good proxy. And I think it can get to $20-plus in the fourth – in the far right. 
Marc Bianchi
Okay. Last one for me. On the quoted or the value-added, you may have commented and I might have missed – misinterpreted that, there were shipments in March that really picked up. Was that – did I read that correctly that there was an acceleration at the end of the quarter? Or were you just commenting on the March quarter overall with that statement?
Jenniffer Deckard 
Really the – there wasn't a significant ramp-up at the end of – in March. However, March was probably a little bit higher than January and February. So there was a slight ramp in March, but it was not material.
Marc Bianchi 
Okay, thanks very much, I will turn in back. 
Jenniffer Deckard 
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from George O'Leary from TPH & Company. Please go ahead. 
George O'Leary 
Good morning guys. 
Michael Biehl 
Good morning George.
Jenniffer Deckard 
Good morning George.
George O'Leary 
So quick question. I thought it was really helpful that you guys provided kind of Q2 volume color of the 3.2 million tons to 3.5 million tons, not trying to drill down too much, but just wondering if you could bifurcate that between the proppant side versus the industrial and recreational side? Maybe even if you can just provide color on whether or not you see as material increase on the I&R side that would help us gauge kind of the split between those two?
Michael Biehl
No, it wouldn't be a material increase on the I&R side. It's pretty consistent with probably the increase we saw in the first quarter, sort of flattish to slightly up. So you can back that off and gauge where the proppant side is going. 
George O'Leary
Okay. That's helpful. And then Q2 – or thinking about pricing, just across grades at this point in time today, or middle of the second quarter, which you guys are expecting to sell, you talked a little bit about pricing levels per se 40/70, 100 mesh and 20/40 and then maybe also talk a little bit about resin pricing, the volumes have taken a nice increase if you just look at the – and I know there is some lumpiness there but just the last 3 quarters, the quarterly increases if averaged out, have been quite attractive, any movement on pricing on the resin side? Or is that just the volume game at this point? 
Jenniffer Deckard 
Resin, I would expect we consistently guide at like-for-like. This is significant mix differentials within resin but like-for-like, we always look at pricing still relatively flat. The interesting thing is that, we really are seeing price improvements across all the grades, a little bit heavier on the finer meshes but not dramatically. And I think that speaks to the balance of our commitments. 
George O'Leary
It's helpful. And maybe if I can sneak in one more. We continue to hear and seeing some of the data that the DUC count is growing, continue to hear that folks are having some challenges getting frac crews put back to work and completion is lagging, drilling, just curious, what you guys are seeing? And if there's maybe any pent-up demand that you guys can sense from the services companies or the E&Ps that you sell to that are looking to kind of close that gap between completions and drilling? 
Jenniffer Deckard
I think our estimates are that we'll continue in the second quarter. We see a slight increase in DUCs and then perhaps in the third and fourth, maybe start to see some decline. We think that is more a function of completion equipment and crews, versus developed already or capability of getting sand.

George O’Leary
Thanks very much, guys. Good quarter.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thank you.
Michael Biehl

Our next question comes from William Thompson from Barclays. Please go ahead. 
William Thompson
Hey, good morning, Jenniffer. I just wanted to get a clarification may be on what you said to Marc that the $10 spread between sort of the low end of the cost curve and the mean of the cost curve, is that delivered cost basis? Or just kind of mine production cost?
Jenniffer Deckard
That's a great question, William, and as I said, we will start speaking to the planned cost operationally, and the point is that that's not the whole story nor that even the majority of the story. But to talk about the cost curve, otherwise it would have to be specific not only into each basin, but actually into each terminal and into each kind of cluster of well activity.
William Thompson
But if we think about Northern White and the certain basins, it would be much steeper than that, given the delivered cost curve?
Jenniffer Deckard
I think, as you compare Northern White to Northern White, I think the next thing in addition to the plant cost curve would be rail. And the most – the 2 components are: one, are you sitting on rails for the transload, to get from your plant to a transload, which can be $5 to $10. And then do you have unit train capability, which can be $6 to $10. And what is your rate versus tariff on the rails. So those are the 3 larger increases, relative to getting into basin. And then how close is either your in-basin mine or your terminal to the well site, because that last mile, those short miles become very expensive both in relative to how far they are from the well and also how tight is the trucking, because if that trucking gets tighter, those rates will increase. I would say those are the 5 things to focus on if you're thinking about competitive cost comparisons.
William Thompson
Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Jenniffer or Michael, just the moving parts around contribution margins, the $7 to $9 that you mentioned restructuring pricing agreement so to set pricing earlier in the quarter. Is that already been rolled out, that $7 to $9 price increase? And then that obviously applies going to over $20 of contribution margin next quarter, you have the unabsorbed railcars, obviously there is – that can be offset with pulling the rails out of storage, but I mean, that obviously sets up a pretty strong growth in third quarter. Just trying to understand the moving parts there. Thank you.
Jenniffer Deckard
So William, I think, if you actually just outline them all exactly correctly, and I would say the $7 to $9 is based on what has already been implemented, as of April 1. And that is just the raw frac only. Just want to mention, we talked about resins are being flat but that is on raw frac sand across the board.
William Thompson
And as I sneak one more in, just addressing some confusion around tempered and curable and then maybe you mentioned the curable for flowback issues. Is that pertaining to the Permian Basin? You just maybe talk about on a geological basis how we should think about where that curable demand is? And is there any resurgence in tempered, given activity increasing some of these non-Permian Basins?
Jenniffer Deckard
It's a great question. I think that we did see some increase for the first time in our tempered products, particularly in the fourth quarter. And the acceleration in the first quarter was more related to curables. And the tempered, you'll see those products used in deeper wells with higher closure strength because you need that added strength and tempered provides that. The curables are going to be used across all basins, where a flowback is experienced and that is not only in every basin, but it's also within different plays. For example, in the Permian in those fracked plays, some, you experience flowback in some and not in others.

William Thompson
Is curable used with other raw sands? Just thinking about – is it complimentary for some...
Jenniffer Deckard
Yes. That's a great question. It's generally used with raw frac sands or if you have a curable to flowback for attempts they can be used with tempered sand but it's typically at the tail end. So you frac the first part of the stage with raw frac sand or ceramics or tempered resin. And then you tail in with a curable to create that lock for the proppant. So call it 5% to 15%.
William Thompson
It’s helpful. Thank you.
Jenniffer Deckard
Welcome.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Blake Hancock from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Blake Hancock
Thanks, good morning, guys. Jenniffer, I wanted to talk, I hate to harp on pricing, but wanted to go back to kind of the comments you've made. The $7 and $9 in 2Q, can you maybe talk about what we're seeing actually in the spot market. And I believe, you said 3Q could possibly be up more than what we saw in 2Q. Can you just clarify that? Make sure we understand, what we're seeing in the spot versus your market pricing and the ASP? And then how that might – if we continue on this progression, does 3Q stand to be greater – show a greater increase than what we saw in 2Q?
Jenniffer Deckard
So the third quarter, I would say, we don't have a comment on the magnitude of the price increases, so we will be working through that here in the next 4 weeks. We certainly are seeing on the high end spot pricing that can be upwards of in the low to mid-40s. And remember that we have – the large majority of our products are sold to contracted customers that has been long our focus. And so we will tend to move toward – the market will move toward spot pricing, and we will converge to market pricing.
Blake Hancock
Okay. That's great. And then, I guess, as we think about those 3 mines left to reactivate, can you just kind of – if we think about full capacity with the 2 reactivated today versus kind of full capacity of reactivating the next 3, can you help us kind of think about what the impact would be on a normalized kind of cost per ton basis? Just so we have an idea of, if you bring the 2 million on, what that could do to your average cost?
Jenniffer Deckard
Remember, when – we have talked about that, we don't necessarily bring plants online relative to their total cost. But I would say, relative to our existing footprint, which includes, of course, Wedron, Maiden Rock, Voca, the average cost of the plants that we bring online will be higher than our cost is today but that will also be spread across now 12 million tons to 14 million tons. So the impact, it will be up from our average but probably minimally.
Blake Hancock
Okay. That’s great. I appreciate guys. Thank you.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Brandon Dobell from William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Brandon Dobell
Thanks. Maybe take the transportation side for a second. If you think about what the right, I don't know, sustainable or normalized level of FOB mine versus in-basin deliveries should look like relative to what your capacity is going to be? Was this quarter decent proxy? Or should we see that drift down a handful more percentage points as you bring these other mines online?
Jenniffer Deckard
Our guidance – our formal guidance in the script was that we would expect a little bit higher FOB mine, as we look forward to the next couple of quarters, because of the Maiden Rock and Brewer have a little bit higher percentage of FOB mines, based on our commitments. So we're considering that those plants were not fully ramped up. That would indicate that we probably have a little bit higher FOB mine going forward.
Brandon Dobell
Okay. And, Jenniffer, any updated comments on how you guys view last mile solutions? And what's your cost control conversations are like around getting sand from various transload facilities to the wellhead these days? 

Jenniffer Deckard
We do not have a significant amount of dialogue with our customers relative to last mile other than as we explore. But on a daily basis, we don't manage them last mile. Our service company partners manage the last mile. We do, of course, we've evaluated last mile, over the last 3 years. We certainly see the value – the need for last mile service of course but also see the value of the recent innovation. That is done in last mile as it relates to efficiency, dust mitigation and so forth. However, we still do not see that as a top priority investment for us in the short run for both strategic and investment priorities.

Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed this. So forgive me if I did. But can you speak a little more to your value-added product outlook for 2Q? Or would you expect volume increase? And maybe I heard that pricing was not increasing, but would you expect volume increase?
Jenniffer Deckard
Yes, pricing, we would expect to be flat on a like-for-like basis, but we definitely expect continued growth in our value-added proppants.
Brad Handler
Okay. Is that…
Jenniffer Deckard
I wouldn't guide to that 59% growth, as I mentioned. The typically resin-coated volumes correlate quite closely over time with additions in rig count with a couple of months lag. We did outpace that in Q1, which we think was – had a few factors, including some pent-up demand from Q4. And so with those factors in mind, we would expect to see an increase relative to kind of leading rig count changes.
Brad Handler
Okay. That's helpful. Can you put SSP comments into the mix here? The – obviously you saw some nice uptake based on your commentary. Do have visibility on that continuing to move forward through the course of '17?
Jenniffer Deckard
We definitely do. We see activity for Propel SSP, and I think what will be important to think about is that we are still in commercialization mode. So we will have customers in what we do at 3 phases, one is the trial phase, confirmation phase and then commercial phase. So all of those, of course, have different pricing levels. As we – as we entice people to try for themselves, and so that they can believe what they're hearing and see with their own wells. We entice them with pricing. So the mix between commercial and price and trial well will impact the net pricing, but we do see continued uplift going forward on volumes.
Brad Handler
Okay. Let me switch gears please. This is an unrelated follow-up and maybe I'm forgetting this from a prior call. But can you break down the $50 million in CapEx, Michael. I think, you mentioned $10 million going into maintenance, but can you put that into some other buckets for us, so we understand the spend?
Michael Biehl
The $10 million to $15 million, again, is due to maintenance overall and that would include our maintenance for our new startups, but we also put costs in there – capital costs in there, for example, new lease cost for – not only lease cost but CapEx cost for our plant startups for equipment that we had to put in place. It also includes shifting of about $11 million. There is some – there is a maybe 5% of those is track expansion. 5% to 10% is track expansion in logistics and then there is also some allocated to reserve expansion. And then also additionally in train investments for terminals.
Brad Handler
Okay. The startup expenditure, just to be clear, that's buried in that $10 million to $15 million of maintenance? The reactivation...
Michael Biehl
That $10 million to $15 million is the overall maintenance and it would include maintenance of the new plants. There is the separate CapEx for equipment related to the 2 plants that we're starting up.

Brad Handler
Okay. And that's – by the way, that's because those – that equipment was relocated when you deactivated the plants? Or is the things just wear out?
Michael Biehl
Combination of both, correct.
Brad Handler
Okay. Thanks. I will turn it back.
Operator 
Our next question comes from John Daniel from Simmons and Company. Please go ahead. 
John Daniel
Hey, thanks for getting me in call. Apologies if I missed this. But can you just characterize what percent of the quarter-over-quarter volume growth, Q2 versus Q1, is likely be the coarser-grade sands?
Jenniffer Deckard
I would say based upon the capacities that we're adding, it would be a 50-50, probably. So it's probably a fairly similar product mix.
John Daniel
Got it. Okay. And then, not mistaken, I believe you noted an attempt to move pricing higher in Q3, assuming I heard that correctly and assuming demand trends persist as they are today, would you expect that Q3 increase to be similar to the $7 to $9 a ton, you mentioned for Q2? Just directionally the same lower or higher would be helpful?
Jenniffer Deckard
Sorry, it's probably too early for us to give that kind of guidance.
John Daniel
Okay. Fair enough. But again – are you having those discussions with customers today about the Q3 increases? Or is that something you'd do later this quarter?
Jenniffer Deckard
It will be starting now. So we want to get them probably 30 days notice. So that will be in – those discussions will be happening in May.
John Daniel
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thank you.
Operator
And this time, I’d now like to turn the call back over to Jenniffer for closing remarks.
Jenniffer Deckard
Thanks, Carol. And thank you all for joining us today. We're super optimistic that the strength we've seen thus far in 2017 will continue in the short term. And we believe that our Fairmount Santrol team has well positioned us to take continued advantage of this, both in the short run and the long run. So as always, we appreciate your continued interest in Fairmount Santrol. Have a great day.

CHESTERLAND, Ohio, May 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Fairmount Minerals announced today that Jenniffer Deckard has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer. She is assuming this position upon the retirement of Chuck Fowler after his seventeen years in that capacity. Fowler will continue as a Director and as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Fairmount Board.  Although stepping down from day-to-day management responsibility, Fowler will continue as a mentor and advisor to management.

Deckard joined Fairmount in 1994 in Illinois and was appointed President in January 2011.  Prior to that date, she was Chief Financial Officer and has led the company's extensive Sustainable Development activities since 2005. She has strongly promoted the company's SD commitment through the engagement of everyone in the organization in strengthening the communities in which the company operates and protecting the environment while continuing the dynamic growth of the company in revenues and profitability.
"I am extremely confident that under Jenniffer's leadership Fairmount will continue to grow as a result of her continuing emphasis on technical and commercial developments, acquisitions and organic expansions, while emphasizing the strength of Fairmount's dedication to the keys of Sustainability, the three P's:  People, Planet and Prosperity," said Fowler.
Deckard has a BS in accounting from the University of Tulsa and an Executive MBA from the Weatherhead School of Management of Case Western Reserve University with highest honors.  She serves on the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Business Advisory Council and the Weatherhead School of Management's Visiting Committee.  She is a member of the boards of Greater Cleveland Partnership, the Chardon Healing Fund, First Tee of Cleveland and the Fairmount Minerals Foundation.
Fairmount's Founder, Bill Conway, echoed Fowler's confidence in Deckard and added, "Chuck Fowler's twenty-nine year leadership career at Fairmount brought about incredible growth in revenues, employees and facilities in this country and abroad.  Chuck will continue to share his knowledge of the industry and his commitment to Sustainable Development and Philanthropy within Fairmount and the broader community.  Chuck Fowler is the personification of Fairmount's motto:  Do Good. Do Well.  He has passed this philosophy on to Jenniffer and the entire Fairmount organization."

Featured Uplifting Leader: Jenniffer D. Deckard




Jenniffer D. Deckard
President and Chief Executive Officer, Fairmount Santrol
When BrownFlynn co-founders Barb Brown and Margie Flynn set out to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their consulting firm, they embarked on a book project that’s purpose was to give further voice to women leaders.
The result was Uplifting Leaders* (*Who Happen to be Women), which captures insights and advice from 25 of the nation’s most influential and accomplished women business leaders.
Featured in the book is Jenniffer Deckard, the president and chief executive officer of Cleveland-based Fairmount Santrol, one of the largest providers of high-performance sand and sand-based products used by oil and gas exploration and production companies to enhance the productivity of their wells.
Jenniffer’s insights came from not only her experience as a prominent leader within her industry, but also from being raised by a family who taught her the importance of community responsibility.
As she shares in the book: “We always had an extra person in the house. We didn’t have a lot of money, but if anybody was in need, my mother put a roof over their head.”
Jenniffer joined Fairmount Santrol (then Fairmount Minerals) in 1994 and was soon named chief financial officer, serving until 2011 when she was named president and subsequently chief executive officer in 2013.
In October 2014, Jenniffer and the company’s leadership team led Fairmount Santrol to its initial public offering and the company is now traded on the New York Stock Exchange (FMSA).
Jenniffer has been recognized by Crain’s Cleveland Business in its annual “Forty Under 40” list, and she was named the 2008 “CFO of the Year” for large privately held businesses in Greater Cleveland.
She currently serves on the Weatherhead School of Management’s Visiting Committee for Case Western Reserve University, and actively serves on the advisory boards of the Cleveland Foundation and RPM International Inc.
The Deckard family is actively engaged in multiple educational and civic programs and have both opened their home and provided resources to help serve children within the Geauga County and Greater Cleveland Foster Care System.
