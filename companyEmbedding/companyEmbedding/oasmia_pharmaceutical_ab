Home / About Oasmia / Production 


Production
Manufacturing pharmaceuticals for clinical sales and trials



With approval from the Swedish Medical Products Agency and the US FDA, we manufacture drugs for both clinical sales and trials. Manufacturing approval requires the maintenance of cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice). GMP ensures that the patient is given drugs that are safe and of the right quality. The authorities carry out regular inspections to ensure cGMP.
Government inspections at our facilities have been successful, meaning the quality systems and processes are satisfactory and meet cGMP. On an ongoing basis, we at Oasmia are working to secure and improve the quality of our systems. Our production facility in Uppsala is designed to manufacture all of our company’s products on a small scale. Our facility can perform the chemical synthesis needed to develop our proprietary excipient XR17 as well as manufacture our suite of oncology products Apealea (Paclical), Paccal-Vet, Doxophos and Docecal.
In order to supply the global pharmaceutical market with our oncology products for both human and veterinary use, a successful scaling up of the manufacturing process for Paclical and Paccal Vet has been initiated at Baxter Oncology GmbH in Germany. The manufacturing of XR17 is also being scaled up due to increased market demand. Manufacturing of our oncology products is done through mixing our patented and proprietary excipient XR17 with the active substance while the water solution of the product is prepared. In the water solution micelles are formed where the excipient encloses the active substance. The water solution is sterile filtered, filled in vials and freeze-dried. All manufacturing processes are carried out in premises classified as clean rooms, and are constantly monitored to secure the aseptic process and a product of high quality. All the labeling, storage and distribution of the finished products takes place in Uppsala.

multilang-release






Uppsala, Sweden, 2017-06-14 08:40 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
	Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB (NASDAQ: OASM) has entered into a new exclusive marketing and distributions agreement with Hetero Group (Hetero) with the goal of driving revenue in Russia and other CIS markets. 

An international pharmaceutical company with 15,000 employees in over 120 countries, Hetero is recognized for its strengths in research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of a wide range of products.

Under the agreement, Hetero will be responsible for the marketing and distribution of Paclical in Russia and several other markets spanning CIS markets, including Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The relationship is a significant one for Oasmia, as Hetero possesses a large distribution and sales operation in the region and will be investing its own resources into the marketing of Paclical and future Oasmia products Doxophos and Docecal, for which they have an option to distribute. The terms in the agreement are similar to the previous agreement for the region.

Oasmia and Hetero Group have also signed a letter of intent regarding India and South America, which will be negotiated separately.

“We welcome Oasmia and their diverse suite of oncology products to our platform,” said Dr. Bandi Parthasaradhi Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director at Hetero Group. “Our review of the product indicates it is well suited in many of the regions where we possess a strong marketing and distribution presence. We are confident in our ability to drive adoption of Paclical, supplying an important treatment to physicians and patients, as well as revenue to both companies.”

	 “We are pleased to enter into this partnership with Hetero, an organization with an expansive distribution and industry relationships that we believe will support the growth, and ultimately revenue, of Oasmia products,” said Julian Aleksov, Executive Chairman at Oasmia Pharmaceutical. “It is important to note that this agreement retains the favourable conditions for both parties that Oasmia has held in the past with its previous partner. We believe the structure of this relationship, coupled with the globally recognized capabilities of Hetero, positions Oasmia for the growth we expect of our products.”

Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB (publ): The board of directors resolves upon a rights issue of approximately 163.9 MSEK
The board of directors of Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB (publ) (”Oasmia” or the ”Company”) announces that the board of directors on 11 June 2017 has resolved to, based on an authorisation from the annual general meeting 26 September 2016 and the extraordinary general meeting 2 June 2017, carry out a new issue of shares with preferential rights for the current shareholders (the “Rights Issue”).

multilang-release






Uppsala, Sweden, 2017-06-12 08:30 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

Oasmia’s board of directors has resolved to, based on an authorisation from the annual general meeting 26 September 2016 and the extraordinary general meeting 2 June 2017, carry out a new issue of shares of approximately 163.9 MSEK with preferential rights for Oasmia’s current shareholders through the issue of not more than 50,439,266 shares 

Shareholders in Oasmia have preferential rights to subscribe for two (2) new shares for every five (5) existing shares, i.e. a subscription ratio of 2:5

The subscription price in the Rights Issue is 3.25 SEK per new share

The Rights Issue is 100 per cent covered by subscription and guarantee commitments


	 

Background and rationale

Oasmia develops a new generation of drugs within human and veterinary oncology. The product development aims to manufacture novel formulations based on well-established cytostatics, which, compared to current alternatives, show improved properties, a reduced side-effect profile and an expanded therapeutic area. Product development is based on in-house research within nanotechnology and proprietary patents.

The Company’s product Paclical has obtained approval in Russia for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Concerning Paclical, Oasmia has carried out a phase III study in which all end-points were achieved. The complete report from the trial with Paclical for the treatment of ovarian cancer shows that Paclical has a positive risk/benefit profile. The data will form the basis for the application for marketing approval to the EMA, which was submitted in February 2016. During 2017, the Company expects that it will submit an application for marketing approval to the FDA in the USA.

The board of directors has resolved to transfer the Company’s veterinarian assets to its wholly owned subsidiary in the USA in order to simplify development and strategical co-operations and strengthen resources to marketing and sales.

During the next twelve months, Oasmia expects to have a capital requirement consisting of costs and investments that amounts to approximately 125 MSEK. The costs can be divided as follows.


Operational costs and investments of approximately 100 MSEK, consisting of costs in relation to the registration of Apealea/Paclical and as well as costs relating to the ramp-up of production facilities.

Costs in relation to clinical studies of approximately 10 MSEK.

Costs for obligations to the Company’s creditors amounting to approximately 15 MSEK.


Oasmia has access to working capital of approximately 50 MSEK, consisting of cash and committed credit facilities. Consequently, the existing working capital is not sufficient to cover the requirements for the next twelve months.

Oasmia’s Board of Directors has, in the light of the above, decided to carry out a new issue of not more than 50,439,266 amounting to approximately 163.9 MSEK, with preferential rights for the existing shareholders in Oasmia. Net proceeds to Oasmia following the deduction of transaction related costs will amount to approximately 150 MSEK. The rights issue is fully covered by subscription and guarantee commitments.

The board of directors have the opinion that the Company’s current strategy and ongoing activities in combination with a capital raise will create foundation to best develop and realize the Company’s potential of profitability. Considering the current financing situation and existing credit facilities together with the funds from this rights issue, the board assumes the Company has enough financial resources to materialize the existing strategical plan during the coming twelve month period. This capital raise will also give the Company a strategic negotiating position in on-going and coming discussions with potential partners.

	 

The Rights Issue 

Oasmia’s board of directors has resolved to, based on an authorisation from the annual general meeting 26 September 2016 and the extraordinary general meeting 2 June 2017, carry out a new issue of shares of approximately 163.9 MSEK with preferential rights for Oasmia’s current shareholders through the issue of not more than 50,439,266 shares for a subscription price of 3.25 SEK per share.   

Shareholders in Oasmia will have preferential rights to the subscription of new shares in proportion to the number of shares held. The right to subscribe for new shares with preferential rights will be afforded those who on the record date are registered as shareholders. One (1) share will entitle to two (2) subscription rights and five (5) subscription rights will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share. The record date with Euroclear Sweden AB for participation in the Rights Issue will be 19 June 2017.   

The subscription period for the Rights Issue (subscription through payment) will run from and including 21 June 2017 to and including 5 July 2017. Oasmia’s board of directors are entitled to extend the subscription period. The Rights Issue will mean that the share capital will increase with not more than 5,043,926.60 SEK and that the numbers of shares will increase with not more than 50,439,266. Trading in subscription rights on Nasdaq Stockholm is expected to occur from and including 21 June 2017 to and including 3 July 2017.

Provided that the Rights Issue is subscribed for in full, the number of shares in the Company will increase from 126,098,166 shares to 176,537,432 shares and the share capital will increase from 12,609,816.60 SEK to 17,653,743.20 SEK, which corresponds to an increase of circa 40 per cent. The total proceeds from the Rights Issue, at full subscription, amounts to 163.9 MSEK before deduction of transaction related costs. Current shareholders that does not take part in the Rights Issue will be affected by a dilution effect of approximately 28.5 per cent of the total amount of shares and votes in the Company after the Rights Issue. Shareholders that does not take part in the Rights issue has the possibility to be economically compensated for the dilution effect through selling their subscription rights in the market.

In the event that less then all shares are subscribed for with preferential rights, the board of directors shall, within the new issue’s maximum amount, resolve on the allocation of shares not subscribed for with preferential rights. Firstly, such allocation allocation shall be made to those who have applied for subscription and subscribed for shares by virtue of subscription rights, regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not, and, in case of over subscription, pro rata in relation to the number of subscription rights used by such persons for subscription of shares, and, where this is not possible, by drawing of lots. Secondly, allocation shall be made to others who have applied for subscription without preferential right and, in case of over subscription, pro rata in relation to the number of shares stated in each subscription application, and, where this is not possible, by drawing of lots. Thirdly, allocation shall be made to persons who guaranteed the Rights Issue pro rata in relation to the amount guaranteed, and, where this is not possible, by drawing of lots

	 

Subscription and guarantee commitments 

The Rights Issue is 100 per cent covered by subscription and guarantee commitments. The subscription and guarantee commitments are not secured through a pledge, bank guarantee or a similar arrangement.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.

A: This program is intended for all Americans who have been prescribed medications they simply cannot afford.
Q: How do I apply for this prescription assistance program?
A: There is no fee to apply.  You can start an application online by CLICKING HERE or you can speak to a real live person! Call 1-877-386-0206 and a Simplefill representative can start an application over the phone. Please note our offices are open Monday-Friday 10:00-7:00 EDT.
Q: Is there a fee?
A: IF the patient is approved and we know our service will be a cost saving solution, then we will enroll the patient into our program. We will assist the patient in getting their medication(s) at no cost to them. The patient will be charged a small monthly fee for us to enroll them into the available programs, ensure their refills are processed regularly, and maintain their eligibility in the programs.  This fee covers 100% of the cost of the medications. There are no hidden fees.
We research all available options for our patients. Often times, the patients are not eligible for assistance based on the manufacturer’s guidelines. When this is the case, we apply for grant funding on behalf of the patient. The patient will be responsible for 9 monthly payments of $45 and will receive a minimum of $2000.00 to be used towards the cost of the medications for their specific illness.
Q: Is there a limit to how many medications you will help me with?
A: No! We can help you with as many prescribed medicines that are available in our formulary.
Q: What if I only need help paying for my prescriptions temporarily?
A: We certainly understand special circumstances that may cause you to need assistance on a temporary basis, such as unemployment, and we are more than happy to assist you during your time of need. Our program is a month to month program and you can cancel at any time by simply calling us at 1-877-386-0206 and selecting option #4. There are no contracts!
Q: How will I get my medications?
The shipment method of your medication varies based on the medication and whether or not you have health insurance.  Your medicine will either come directly to your home, to your doctor’s office or you will pick it up from your local pharmacy.
Q: Can I benefit from this program if I am enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan?
A: Yes. Many of our patients come to us who are on Medicare and have a Part D plan, however they are unable to afford their copays or find themselves in the coverage gap of their prescription plan, commonly referred to as the “Donut Hole”.
Q: What if I have prescription insurance and still cannot afford my medication?
A: If your insurance company has denied paying for your prescriptions or you have a high copay or coinsurance responsibility, Simplefill can help! Call us at 1-877-386-0206.
Q: How are refills handled?
A: We want to make this simple! We have a hard working Refill Team and their main concern is the seamless shipment of our members medications.  If there are any issues with a Simplefill member’s refill, they are notified by our Refill Team immediately. Our Refill Team will work with the patient, their prescriber and the pharmaceutical companies to remedy any issues so there is no disruption to the patient’s shipment of medications.
Q: What if I have a change in my medication?
A: The only constant is change! That is why we understand your treatment may change as well. Again, we want to make it simple. If you need to add or change a medication or doctor, simply call us and we will take care of the rest! We will make the appropriate changes for future refills and assist you with new medications whenever possible.

About Us






Our Story
We know the story all too well: you or your loved one has a chronic illness. You constantly worry about how you’re going to afford prescriptions. Sometimes, you even have to grapple with the horrible question of whether you’re going to pay rent, buy groceries, keep the lights on or purchase your life-saving medication.
We want this tug-of-war to end. But how?
Simplefill was established in October of 2009 after both founders personally experienced first-hand how vital prescription assistance programs truly are. After experiencing frustrations at the bureaucracy of prescription assistance, we decided to take the reins and create a new system that allows all patients to be treated with dignity, respect, and care so they can get the medications they need to live well.
Simplefill began as a small team of dedicated advocates trying to find a solution to the high cost of brand name prescriptions. Over the years Simplefill has grown into a company that proudly serves thousands of patients each month, both insured and uninsured, with the cost of their much needed brand name medications.
What We Do
Simplefill is a program dedicated to offering efficient assistance for patients who are prescribed unaffordable medication(s). We do this by using the available programs offered through the pharmaceutical companies and foundations that offer grant funding for chronic diseases.
We tailored a proprietary system which ensures patients receive their medications and never fall through the cracks. Each patient is assigned to an advocate who monitors their medications and eligibility in the programs. Our advocates continue to provide support even after the medication is received.
Simplefill is a nationwide advocacy service that helps patients who do not have adequate financial resources and limited to no prescription coverage, receive help with their medications.
The rarity of prescription assistance programs means there’s also a rarity in the amount of personal attention and care patients receive. Our mission is to change all of that, and become not just a place to help patients get the prescriptions they need at a price they can afford, but also lend a caring ear and provide a source of comfort during stressful and frightening times.
Our advocates work directly with their patients’ doctors to obtain the correct prescription. We double and triple check prescription names, dosages, and patient information to ensure our patients will receive their much-needed medication with as little hassle as possible. Our elderly and sick patients cannot advocate for themselves, and rely on Simplefill to take care of the details while they focus on living well.
What Makes us Different
Your relationship with Simplefill doesn’t end by receiving a pack of forms to fill out on your own. Our dedicated advocates interview you to determine how we can best help you in your search for low-cost prescriptions.
As experts, we are familiar with prescription drug substitutions which could make a world of difference to your wallet as some medications are covered in prescription assistance plans while others are not.
We know the insurance industry is complicated with many barriers and bureaucracy. Many times, our patients will have multiple doctors and multiple medications. We advocate on behalf of our patients to alleviate the massive burden of understanding what type of assistance is available. We find the best way to navigate those services.
We work with your doctor directly and send necessary paperwork to your doctor’s office. Your advocate will be in contact with them every step of the way. Once you reach out to your advocate, you will hear a response within 24 hours.
If for some reason your prescription cannot be filled, we also write letters of appeal on your behalf.
We understand that underinsured or uninsured patients looking for prescription assistance are often in a tough situation and need a helping hand. This is why we offer a human touch with real people who answer the phone and provide assistance along the way. We strongly believe we have developed a simple solution to a complex problem.
Reach out to us today and let us help improve your life.

Probiotic Supplement Buyer’s Guide








For July 2017
Which Probiotic Supplement Works Best?
Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

You have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord.
Your gut has 100 trillion bacteria, 3 pounds worth, and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body. That’s a lot of cells in your gut!
Having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function. 
Want glowing and clear skin? Good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin. 
A surprising 95% of the serotonin, the happy molecule in your brain, is made in your gut! Balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity. 

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.
The Results of Our Research
Our review process eliminated most of the brands we reviewed. After a thorough analysis, these are the top-rated probiotic brands we feel you can confidently choose from. Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood. They also had a positive buying experience and many reported seeing results in as little as a few weeks.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.

It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.
The Results of Our Research
Our review process eliminated most of the brands we reviewed. After a thorough analysis, these are the top-rated probiotic brands we feel you can confidently choose from. Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood. They also had a positive buying experience and many reported seeing results in as little as a few weeks.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.

Probiotic Supplement Buyer’s Guide








For July 2017
Which Probiotic Supplement Works Best?
Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

You have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord.
Your gut has 100 trillion bacteria, 3 pounds worth, and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body. That’s a lot of cells in your gut!
Having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function. 
Want glowing and clear skin? Good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin. 
A surprising 95% of the serotonin, the happy molecule in your brain, is made in your gut! Balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity. 

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.

Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.

Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.
