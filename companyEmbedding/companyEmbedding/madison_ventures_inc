This prospectus relates to shares of our common stock that may be offered and 
sold from time to time by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any 
of the proceeds from the sale of the common shares being offered for sale by 
the selling security holders.


The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are 
competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are 
a very early stage mineral exploration company and a very small participant 
in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration 
company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint 
venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional 
geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies. We have 
no competitive position or advantage in the mining industry. 
  
Methods of competition in the mining industry are to discover, acquire and 
finance the development of mineral properties considered to have commercial 
potential before other competitors do.  In addition, mining companies compete 
with each other by acquiring and utilizing mineral exploration equipment and 
hiring qualified mineral exploration and development personnel before
competitors do.


Company Description
Madison Ventures Inc. was incorporated on September 14, 2009, under the laws 
of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration 
activities. 

---

We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration 
of mineral properties. We currently hold an


 option, under the Option Agreement, 
to acquire a 100% undivided interest the Johnny Lake Property located in the 
Thunder Bay Mining District of the Province of Ontario, Canada. We are 
currently conducting mineral exploration activities on the Johnny Lake Property 
in order to assess whether it contains any commercially exploitable mineral 
reserves. Currently there are no known mineral reserves on the Johnny Lake 
Property. 

---

While we intend to test for commercially viable reserves of gold, sulphur and 
pyrite occurrence with secondary silver, there is the likelihood of our mineral 
claim containing little or no economic mineralization or reserves of gold and 
other minerals. We are presently in the exploration stage of our business and 
we can provide no assurance that any commercially viable mineral deposits 
exist on our mineral claims, that we will discover commercially exploitable 
levels of mineral resources on our property, or, if such deposits are 
discovered, that we will enter into further substantial exploration programs. 
Further exploration is required before a final determination can be made as 
to whether our mineral claims possess commercially exploitable mineral deposits. 
If our claim does not contain any reserves all funds that we spend on 
exploration will be lost. 

---

The Company’s principal offices are located at Loma de Bernal 3, Loma Dorada 
C.P. 76060, Queretaro, Quetaro, Mexico, and our telephone number is 
+52 (442) 388-2645.

This prospectus relates to shares of our common stock that may be offered and 
sold from time to time by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any 
of the proceeds from the sale of the common shares being offered for sale by 
the selling security holders.


The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are 
competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are 
a very early stage mineral exploration company and a very small participant 
in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration 
company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint 
venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional 
geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies. We have 
no competitive position or advantage in the mining industry. 
  
Methods of competition in the mining industry are to discover, acquire and 
finance the development of mineral properties considered to have commercial 
potential before other competitors do.  In addition, mining companies compete 
with each other by acquiring and utilizing mineral exploration equipment and 
hiring qualified mineral exploration and development personnel before
competitors do.


Company Description
Madison Ventures Inc. was incorporated on September 14, 2009, under the laws 
of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration 
activities. 

---

We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration 
of mineral properties. We currently hold an


 option, under the Option Agreement, 
to acquire a 100% undivided interest the Johnny Lake Property located in the 
Thunder Bay Mining District of the Province of Ontario, Canada. We are 
currently conducting mineral exploration activities on the Johnny Lake Property 
in order to assess whether it contains any commercially exploitable mineral 
reserves. Currently there are no known mineral reserves on the Johnny Lake 
Property. 

---

While we intend to test for commercially viable reserves of gold, sulphur and 
pyrite occurrence with secondary silver, there is the likelihood of our mineral 
claim containing little or no economic mineralization or reserves of gold and 
other minerals. We are presently in the exploration stage of our business and 
we can provide no assurance that any commercially viable mineral deposits 
exist on our mineral claims, that we will discover commercially exploitable 
levels of mineral resources on our property, or, if such deposits are 
discovered, that we will enter into further substantial exploration programs. 
Further exploration is required before a final determination can be made as 
to whether our mineral claims possess commercially exploitable mineral deposits. 
If our claim does not contain any reserves all funds that we spend on 
exploration will be lost. 

---

The Company’s principal offices are located at Loma de Bernal 3, Loma Dorada 
C.P. 76060, Queretaro, Quetaro, Mexico, and our telephone number is 
+52 (442) 388-2645.
