Anthony Monfet
Amazon FBA Featured Merchant - Amazon Business Consultant



























  	          Hello future students, my name is Anthony Monfet and I am an entrepreneur.  I have been selling online professionally since 2001, and I formed my first real business just a couple of years later, becoming an Ebay Titanium Powerseller (that means I had over $150,000 per month in sales) within my first year of business!     	          Shortly after my Ebay business became an immediate success, I sold that business and moved into a new venture, and that was becoming an Amazon retailer.  My Amazon business, which is still in operation today, started ack in 2007 selling a variety of sporting goods through Amazon and other marketplaces.  I was able to achieve over $1.2 million in sales within the first 10 months of doing business on Amazon, and only doubled those sales year in and year out for the next few years thereafter.  These days, I spend my time running my consulting business, mentoring and training others to sell better on Amazon the same way I do right now -- with Private Label Product selling -- importing products from China and reselling them on Amazon through the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program.  I work with over 100+ clients at any given time, and my time is extremely limited due to the fact that I also still run an Amazon business of my own and want to ensure that all of my clients get the most of my attention as possible.   	          Beyond my experiences selling on Ebay and Amazon, I have sold products on nearly every marketplace there is available on the internet today. Our company was one of the initial sellers on Sears Marketplace and have also been at the forefront of every new marketplace development for many other sites as well--receiving personal invitations to join their websites and join their seller communities.     	        Additionally, I have also worked with many of the companies who are involved in helping sellers sell more products online (i.e. ChannelAdvisor, Doba, Inventory Source, World Wide Brands, and more!)  Each of these companies, and others as well are all very reputable companies in this industry (online retailing).  They have all been around for more than a decade each, servicing sellers like you and me, and helping us to achieve a higher level of success online.     	          Along with my online businesses, I also was a member of the U.S. Army for almost ten years, serving our country honorably, before retiring in June 2013.     	          I hope that you are able to learn a great deal from my courses here on Udemy as I aim to become the single greatest educator when it comes to teaching people how to sell products online.     	          Thank you for your time,     	          Anthony Monfet

Gray Root Touch Up 




“Curls are part seduction and part nemesis; it is hard to gauge and control some days.  Part of our clientele quest endlessly for new ways to remove curl, while for others no matter what they do it’s never curly enough.”

Whether your hair needs a bit of boost or some serious taming, this renowned line will have a curly hair product for you to create the curly hair style of your dreams. All Strictly Curls products are enriched with Soya Bean and Shea Butter to add intense moisture, while Silk Amino Acids smooth cuticles and Vitamin E protects and promotes healthy hair that shines. This unique formula will give you envious curls while preventing frizz and dryness.

“It’s amazing! Literally, from the basement of my original Marc Anthony Salon came a line of professional hair products so renowned that they can now be found internationally. Marc Anthony products began because we wanted to ensure that all of our clients kept their salon-fresh look wherever they went. Our products are ultimately tailored to our clients’ needs. From curly hair products to create curly hair styles and frizz control, to hair thickening products to create high volume and hold, we have the right product for Your Hair, Your Way.”
“For a cut to sit well, hair has to be in great shape. Hair needs to move, be manageable and have shine to look amazing. That’s why Marc Anthony products have the highest caliber ingredients.”


“On top of working with some of the topmost chemists, our largest point of difference is how we test the products. Our salons are where each product passes or fails. Our International Team of celebrity hair stylists put each product through its paces. We stand behind our brands because we use them in our salons each and every day. That’s the Marc Anthony True Professional difference.”

- Marc Anthony

        Dry Shampoo Products from Marc Anthony
Whether you pushed the "snooze" button one too many times on your alarm and slept in or are hurrying to save time in the locker room or before a night out, dry shampoo is your solution!  Often times, when beating the clock, shampooing hair in the traditional method is just not an option.  A dry shampoo and the ease of use is a great suitable alternative solution.  Modern, busy women swear by dry shampoos!  When your hair appears greasy, it’s usually just the roots (close to the scalp) that need to be refreshed.  Dry shampoos work wonders at reviving your day-old style, soaking up oil, masking odours and amping up volume—no water required.  If you’re strapped for time and don’t have time to wash your hair and you need to freshen up your locks dry shampoo serves as a fantastic solution.  Grab Marc Anthony’s dry shampoo and fake your way to a perfectly washed hair day!
Beach Hair Products - Hold Onto Beach Style Hair All Year Long
Summer is coming to an end, but beach hair is still riding high on the wave of style!  Hold on to this sexy beach hair style all year long, it's as easy as a day at the beach.  To transition this look from beach into fall fashion think "polished."  This sexy look for the beach was tousled and windblown.  For fall, it gets all dressed up with beach hair products with ultra shine and a little refinement.  To keep your beach hair style lasting for days, use a wet set.  First, shampoo and condition your hair before bed and towel dry and brush your hair.  Evenly distribute our ‘Beach Spray’ to your hair from roots to ends, in even sections throughout your hair while scrunching.  Next, apply our "Moisture Gloss" to small sections of your hair to smooth your curls, tame frizz, and give shape and shine.  Lastly, scrunch your hair while following-up with our ‘Pro Finish’ Hair Spray for all day hold.  Follow these easy steps and this will keep your fall beach hair locks in super shiny easy-to-manage shape!  After all, your hairstyle is an accessory to the inner beauty within you!
