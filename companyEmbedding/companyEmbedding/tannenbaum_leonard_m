Leonard M. Tannenbaum (born 1971) is the founder and chief executive officer of Fifth Street Asset Management.[1] He also founded the pro-business political action committee "Keeping America Competitive".[2]
Biography[edit]
Tannenbaum was born to a Jewish family, the son of Adele Fuchsberg and Calvin M. Tannenbaum.[2][3] His father and was a managing partner of Brecher, Fishman, Feit, Heller, Rubin & Tannenbaum, a law firm in New York; his mother was a district administrator for the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services[3] and exile from Cuba.[2][4] He graduated with a BS in economics and an MBA in finance as part of a submatriculation program from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[1][5] He is a Chartered Financial Analyst holder.[5] After school he worked as an equity analyst for Merrill Lynch.[6]
In 1998, he founded Fifth Street Finance, a finance company specializing in raising funds from private investors and investing in small- and mid-sized companies. He raised $30 million[6] ($15 million from his father-in-law, Bruce E. Toll)[7] and established his first fund which made investments until 2004. In January 2005, he launched a second fund, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners II which reached $157 million in value and included institutional investors such as DuPont, Sumitomo Bank and WP Global; the fund stopped investing in 2007. In 2007, he launched a third fund,[6] which in 2008, after taking the advice of David Einhorn, he converted into a business development company (BDC).[6] This entity, named Fifth Street Finance Corp., went public in May 2008.[6] Fifth Street's customers are primarily private equity firms that invest in lower middle-market or middle-market companies (averaging $10 million in EBITDA). Investments average $35 million and never exceed $100 million.[6] Effective September 2014, they received permission form the S.E.C. to increase the maximum investment across its platform to $250 million.[6]
Tannenbaum is a supporter of the The Robin Hood Foundation, Kids in Crisis, United Way and the American Red Cross.[8]
Tannenbaum is also the Chief Executive Officer of LMT Investments LLC and the President of the Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation.
Personal life[edit]
In 1997, Tannenbaum married Elizabeth Toll, daughter of housing developer Bruce E. Toll, in a Jewish ceremony at the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia.[3] They divorced in October 2010.[7]
Today, Tannenbaum is married to Stacey Tannenbaum, who supports Len in his philanthropic efforts.[9]
One of Len’s four children, Max, is the President of Dream Dragons, a company launched by 13 high school students through the Southwestern Connecticut chapter of Junior Achievement program, which empowers young entrepreneurs.[10]
Tannenbaum was engaged in litigation with his former father-in-law, Bruce Toll, which was finalized on December 17, 2014. Bruce Toll, the appellant, sued his former son-in-law over a multimillion-dollar business deal gone bad. Toll alleged that he made an oral agreement with Tannenbaum to personally guarantee loans for one of Tannenbaum's ventures, provided that Toll's daughter (Tannenbaum's wife at the time) would share equally in the profits.
Toll asked the District Court to enforce this purported oral agreement or, in the alternative, for equitable relief. Applying New York law, the District Court granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum on all of Toll's claims. Toll appealed and the appellate court affirmed. In summary, New York law applied to Toll's breach of contract claim. Therefore, the appellate court ruled that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum because the alleged oral contract could not be performed, by Toll's own admission, within one year of its making.
Further, the court said Toll's claims under quasi-contract theory were meritless and that the District Court rightly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum. The court said it considered all issues that were raised by Appellant and found no merit to any of them. Therefore, they affirmed the decision of the District Court.[11]

Item 4.Purpose of the Transaction

 
Item 4 of each reporting person’s Schedule
13D is hereby amended to include the information set forth in Item 6 of this Amendment and the following:
 
Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On July 13, 2017, Fifth Street Management
LLC (“FSM”), Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), Fifth Street Asset Management
Inc. (“FSAM”) (solely for the purposes set forth therein) and Fifth Street Holdings L.P. (“FSH”)
(solely for the purposes set forth therein) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”),
pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, FSM will sell, convey, assign and transfer
to Oaktree and Oaktree will purchase, acquire and accept from FSM all of FSM’s right, title and interest in specified business
records with respect to FSM’s existing investment advisory agreements with each of Fifth Street Finance Corp. (“FSC”)
and Fifth Street Senior Rate Floating Corp. (“FSFR”) for a purchase price of $320 million in cash. The Asset
Purchase Agreement also provides for the entry by Oaktree into new investment advisory agreements with each of FSC and FSFR. The
shares of common stock of FSFR owned by FSH and Leonard M. Tannenbaum (“Mr. Tannenbaum”) are not included in
the transaction.
 
Voting Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, each of FSH, Mr. Tannenbaum, Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation (the “Tannenbaum Foundation”),
Tannenbaum Family 2012 Trust (the “Tannenbaum Trust”) and Oaktree entered into a voting agreement (“FSFR
Voting Agreement”), dated as of July 13, 2017, with respect to the stockholdings of each of FSH, Mr. Tannenbaum, the
Tannenbaum Foundation and the Tannenbaum Trust in FSFR. Pursuant to the FSFR Voting Agreement, each of the aforementioned stockholders
of FSFR (the “Stockholder Signatories”) agreed to vote their shares of FSFR common stock (i) in favor of approving
the proposed new investment advisory agreements with Oaktree and facilitating the election of the four director nominees specified
by Oaktree to the board of directors of FSFR and (ii) otherwise at the direction of Oaktree.
 
The FSFR Voting Agreement terminates upon
the earliest of Oaktree no longer advising FSFR, the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement or, with respect to any Stockholder
Signatory, when such Stockholder Signatory no longer owns shares of FSFR common stock. If the Asset Purchase Agreement terminates
under certain circumstances where FSAM stockholder approval has not been obtained, then the FSFR Voting Agreement will not terminate
until 6 months after the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 

 
 

 



CUSIP No.   31679F 10 1


 
Each Stockholder Signatory has agreed not
to transfer shares of FSFR common stock prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (the
“Closing”). Following the Closing, subject to a right of first refusal for the benefit of Oaktree, a Stockholder
Signatory may transfer shares of FSFR common stock to third parties (these transfers are subject to volume restrictions outside
of transfers to certain specified institutional investors).
 
The foregoing description of the FSFR Voting
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety
by reference to the FSFR Voting Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.6 to this Amendment and is incorporated herein
by reference.
 

Item 5.Interest in Securities of the Issuer

 
Item 5 of each reporting person’s Schedule 13D is
hereby amended and restated as follows:
 
The information set forth in rows 7 through 13 of the cover
page to this Amendment is incorporated by reference. The percentage set forth in row 13 is based on 29,466,768 shares of common
stock outstanding as of May 10, 2017, as reported in the Issuer’s Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2017. For purposes of Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Mr. Tannenbaum and Oaktree have
shared voting and dispositive power over the following shares of FSFR common stock: (i) 5,098,783.622 shares held by Mr. Tannenbaum
directly, (ii) 95,634 shares held by the Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation, for which Mr. Tannenbaum serves as the President; and
(iii) 139,367 shares held directly by the Leonard M. Tannenbaum 2012 Trust (the “Trust”) for the benefit of
certain members of Mr. Tannenbaum’s family for which Mr. Bernard D. Berman is a trustee and (iv) 2,677,519 shares of FSFR
common stock directly held by FSH.
 
Item 6.	Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
with Respect to Securities of the Issuer
 
Item 6 of each reporting person’s Schedule 13D is hereby
amended and supplemented as follows:
 
The description of the FSFR Voting Agreement provided in Item
4 above is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Pledge and Security Agreement
 
At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement, FSFR and FSH will enter into a Pledge and Security Agreement (“Security Agreement”), pursuant
to which FSH will grant a security interest in, and pledge and assign as applicable, a number of shares of FSFR common stock equal
to $10 million in value, calculated pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) and (e) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. These shares will be used
to secure indemnification obligations of FSM and FSH relating to certain SEC investigation-related legal costs and expenses of
FSFR and related fees, fines, monetary penalties, deductibles and disgorgements paid by FSFR, net of any disgorgements paid by
FSM to FSFR and insurance recoveries received by FSFR.
 
The Security Agreement contains default
and similar provisions that are standard for such agreements.
 
The foregoing description of the Security Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Security Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.7 to this Amendment and is incorporated herein by reference.

Leonard M. TannenbaumBorn1971 (age 45–46)NationalityAmericanAlma materUniversity of PennsylvaniaOccupationinvestorKnown forfounder of Fifth Street Asset Management IncSpouse(s)Stacey TannenbaumParent(s)Adele FuchsbergCalvin M. TannenbaumLeonard M. Tannenbaum (born 1971) is the founder and chief executive officer of Fifth Street Asset Management.[1] He also founded the pro-business political action committee "Keeping America Competitive".[2]BiographyTannenbaum was born to a Jewish family, the son of Adele Fuchsberg and Calvin M. Tannenbaum.[2][3] His father and was a managing partner of Brecher, Fishman, Feit, Heller, Rubin & Tannenbaum, a law firm in New York; his mother was a district administrator for the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services[3] and exile from Cuba.[2][4] He graduated with a BS in economics and an MBA in finance as part of a submatriculation program from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[1][5] He is a Chartered Financial Analyst holder.[5] After school he worked as an equity analyst for Merrill Lynch.[6]In 1998, he founded Fifth Street Finance, a finance company specializing in raising funds from private investors and investing in small- and mid-sized companies. He raised $30 million[6] ($15 million from his father-in-law, Bruce E. Toll)[7] and established his first fund which made investments until 2004. In January 2005, he launched a second fund, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners II which reached $157 million in value and included institutional investors such as DuPont, Sumitomo Bank and WP Global; the fund stopped investing in 2007. In 2007, he launched a third fund,[6] which in 2008, after taking the advice of David Einhorn, he converted into a business development company (BDC).[6] This entity, named Fifth Street Finance Corp., went public in May 2008.[6] Fifth Street's customers are primarily private equity firms that invest in lower middle-market or middle-market companies (averaging $10 million in EBITDA). Investments average $35 million and never exceed $100 million.[6] Effective September 2014, they received permission form the S.E.C. to increase the maximum investment across its platform to $250 million.[6]Tannenbaum is a supporter of the The Robin Hood Foundation, Kids in Crisis, United Way and the American Red Cross.[8]Tannenbaum is also the Chief Executive Officer of LMT Investments LLC and the President of the Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation.Personal lifeIn 1997, Tannenbaum married Elizabeth Toll, daughter of housing developer Bruce E. Toll, in a Jewish ceremony at the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia.[3] They divorced in October 2010.[7]Today, Tannenbaum is married to Stacey Tannenbaum, who supports Len in his philanthropic efforts.[9]One of Len’s four children, Max, is the President of Dream Dragons, a company launched by 13 high school students through the Southwestern Connecticut chapter of Junior Achievement program, which empowers young entrepreneurs.[10]Tannenbaum was engaged in litigation with his former father-in-law, Bruce Toll, which was finalized on December 17, 2014. Bruce Toll, the appellant, sued his former son-in-law over a multimillion-dollar business deal gone bad. Toll alleged that he made an oral agreement with Tannenbaum to personally guarantee loans for one of Tannenbaum's ventures, provided that Toll's daughter (Tannenbaum's wife at the time) would share equally in the profits.Toll asked the District Court to enforce this purported oral agreement or, in the alternative, for equitable relief. Applying New York law, the District Court granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum on all of Toll's claims. Toll appealed and the appellate court affirmed. In summary, New York law applied to Toll's breach of contract claim. Therefore, the appellate court ruled that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum because the alleged oral contract could not be performed, by Toll's own admission, within one year of its making.Further, the court said Toll's claims under quasi-contract theory were meritless and that the District Court rightly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum. The court said it considered all issues that were raised by Appellant and found no merit to any of them. Therefore, they affirmed the decision of the District Court.[11]References^ a b Bloomberg: "Fifth Street Founder Set to Become One of World's Youngest Billionaires on IPO" By Caleb Melby and Leslie Picker October 10, 2014^ a b c Greenwich Time: "Political heavy hitters assemble at financier's mansion" by Neil Vigdor May 11, 2012 |The son of a Cuban exile who is also Jewish, Tannenbaum railed on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002^ a b c New York Times: "Elizabeth Toll, Leonard Tannenbaum" May 25, 1997^ Mergers & Acquisitions: "Welcome Wagon for Small Businesses? - Excerpts from Mergers & Acquisitions' interview with Leonard Tannenbaum, founder of Fifth Street Finance Corp. and the founder of the Keeping America Competitive PAC" by MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN September 24, 2012 |"Through my mother, I'm a descendant of Cuba, and I really think Hispanics haven't had the right voice in government."^ a b Association for Corporate Growth: "Leonard M.

Leonard M. Tannenbaum


Born
1971 (age 45–46)


Nationality
American


Alma mater
University of Pennsylvania


Occupation
investor


Known for
founder of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc


Spouse(s)
Stacey Tannenbaum


Parent(s)
Adele Fuchsberg
Calvin M. Tannenbaum


Leonard M. Tannenbaum (born 1971) is the founder and chief executive officer of Fifth Street Asset Management.[1] He also founded the pro-business political action committee "Keeping America Competitive".[2]
Biography[edit]
Tannenbaum was born to a Jewish family, the son of Adele Fuchsberg and Calvin M. Tannenbaum.[2][3] His father and was a managing partner of Brecher, Fishman, Feit, Heller, Rubin & Tannenbaum, a law firm in New York; his mother was a district administrator for the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services[3] and exile from Cuba.[2][4] He graduated with a BS in economics and an MBA in finance as part of a submatriculation program from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[1][5] He is a Chartered Financial Analyst holder.[5] After school he worked as an equity analyst for Merrill Lynch.[6]
In 1998, he founded Fifth Street Finance, a finance company specializing in raising funds from private investors and investing in small- and mid-sized companies. He raised $30 million[6] ($15 million from his father-in-law, Bruce E. Toll)[7] and established his first fund which made investments until 2004. In January 2005, he launched a second fund, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners II which reached $157 million in value and included institutional investors such as DuPont, Sumitomo Bank and WP Global; the fund stopped investing in 2007. In 2007, he launched a third fund,[6] which in 2008, after taking the advice of David Einhorn, he converted into a business development company (BDC).[6] This entity, named Fifth Street Finance Corp., went public in May 2008.[6] Fifth Street's customers are primarily private equity firms that invest in lower middle-market or middle-market companies (averaging $10 million in EBITDA). Investments average $35 million and never exceed $100 million.[6] Effective September 2014, they received permission form the S.E.C. to increase the maximum investment across its platform to $250 million.[6]
Tannenbaum is a supporter of the The Robin Hood Foundation, Kids in Crisis, United Way and the American Red Cross.[8]
Tannenbaum is also the Chief Executive Officer of LMT Investments LLC and the President of the Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation.
Personal life[edit]
In 1997, Tannenbaum married Elizabeth Toll, daughter of housing developer Bruce E. Toll, in a Jewish ceremony at the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia.[3] They divorced in October 2010.[7]
Today, Tannenbaum is married to Stacey Tannenbaum, who supports Len in his philanthropic efforts.[9]
One of Len’s four children, Max, is the President of Dream Dragons, a company launched by 13 high school students through the Southwestern Connecticut chapter of Junior Achievement program, which empowers young entrepreneurs.[10]
Tannenbaum was engaged in litigation with his former father-in-law, Bruce Toll, which was finalized on December 17, 2014. Bruce Toll, the appellant, sued his former son-in-law over a multimillion-dollar business deal gone bad. Toll alleged that he made an oral agreement with Tannenbaum to personally guarantee loans for one of Tannenbaum's ventures, provided that Toll's daughter (Tannenbaum's wife at the time) would share equally in the profits.
Toll asked the District Court to enforce this purported oral agreement or, in the alternative, for equitable relief. Applying New York law, the District Court granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum on all of Toll's claims. Toll appealed and the appellate court affirmed. In summary, New York law applied to Toll's breach of contract claim. Therefore, the appellate court ruled that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum because the alleged oral contract could not be performed, by Toll's own admission, within one year of its making.
Further, the court said Toll's claims under quasi-contract theory were meritless and that the District Court rightly granted summary judgment to Tannenbaum. The court said it considered all issues that were raised by Appellant and found no merit to any of them. Therefore, they affirmed the decision of the District Court.[11]
