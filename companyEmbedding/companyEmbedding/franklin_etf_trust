FLQG Fund Description
The Franklin LibertyQ Global Equity ETF tracks an index of global large- and midcap stocks. Stocks are selected and weighted based on 4 factors (quality, value, momentum, and low volatility) while maintaining similar characteristics to the MSCI ACWI Index.
  
FLQG FactSet Analytics Insight
FLQG offers a multi-factor take on global equities that aims to maintain similar characteristics to its parent index, the MSCI ACWI Index. The ETF aims to enhance exposure to four popular factors—quality, value, momentum, and low volatility—subject to exposure constraints. These same four factors also determine each constituent’s weight, scaled to market capitalization. At rebalance, each constituent’s weight is normalized to its weight within the parent index. These modest tilts and broad exposure suggest the fund is designed as a core, long-term holding rather than a short-term factor play. The expense ratio is in line with competition.

Important Legal Information
This site is intended only for U.S. residents. Using it means you agree to our Terms of Use page.
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Generally, those offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Bond prices are affected by interest rate changes. Bond prices, and thus a bond fund's share price, generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the price of bonds in a fund adjusts to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. To the extent the fund focuses on particular countries, regions, industries, sectors or types of investment from time to time, it may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas of focus than a fund that invests in a wider variety of countries, regions, industries, sectors or investments.  Smaller, mid-sized and relatively new or unseasoned companies can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions, and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger, more established companies. Historically, these securities have experienced more price volatility than larger company stocks, especially over the short-term.Performance of the funds may vary significantly from the performance of an index, as a result of transactions costs, expenses and other factors. For strategic beta ETFs, there can be no assurance that a fund's multi-factor stock selection process will enhance performance. Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods.  For actively managed ETFs, there is no guarantee that the manager's investment decisions will produce the desired results. These and other risks are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETF’s net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Net Asset Value (NAV) represents an ETF’s per-share-value. The NAV per share is determined by dividing the total NAV of the Fund by the number of shares outstanding. The Fund calculates the NAV per share each business day as of 1 p.m. Pacific time which normally coincides with the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and BATS BZX Exchange (BATS). The Fund does not calculate the NAV on days the NYSE and BATS are closed for trading. If the NYSE and BATS have a scheduled early close or unscheduled early close, the Fund’s share price would still be determined as of 1 p.m. Pacific time.            
ETF shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price, not their Net Asset Value (NAV), on the exchange on which they are listed. Shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets and may trade either at a premium or a discount to their NAV on the secondary market. Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units. Each “creator” or “Authorized Participant” enters into an authorized participant agreement with Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc., an affiliate of Franklin Advisers, Inc. Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units directly with the fund.
