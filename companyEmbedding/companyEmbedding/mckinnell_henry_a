      ■ Dr. Henry A. McKinnell Jr. became chief executive officer of
      Pfizer in January 2001 and chairman of the board in April 2001 after
      holding a series of senior executive positions spanning more than 32 years
      with the company. During his time at Pfizer, McKinnell helped turn the
      company from a leader in the pharmaceutical industry into a
      "transforming force" with the acquisitions of Warner-Lambert
      in 2000 and Pharmacia in 2003 and the subsequent successful integration of
      both firms, forming a behemoth that earned $45 billion in 2003. Observers
      described McKinnell as polished, stately, and avuncular, yet also
      exacting, passionate, and sometimes impatient. A deeply moral man,
      McKinnell expanded Pfizer's philanthropic activities both in the
      United States and in the developing world.
    

      PERSONAL BACKGROUND
    

      McKinnell was a third-generation Canadian brought up in Vancouver, British
      Columbia. He went to a Christian Brothers school through the eighth grade,
      an experience that imbued him with a strong moral code. His father owned
      and operated cargo vessels; during his teen years and through college he
      spent school vacations working on his father's ships as a deck-hand
      and first mate. He gained a penchant for racing Austin Healey sports cars
      in events sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America and spent two
      summers racing many West Coast tracks, from Vancouver to Los Angeles.
    

      He enrolled at the University of British Columbia intending to major in
      chemical engineering and eventually become a college professor. He
      described himself as an average student with a greater focus on
      extracurricular activities than academics during the first half of his
      five-year stint at the university. He then married and decided to
      "get serious," switching his major to business
      administration and finishing second in his class.
    

      Based on his achievement McKinnell received a $10,000-a-year fellowship to
      the Stanford Business School, a tidy sum at that time—it was in
      fact more money than most full-time jobs offered. He accepted and earned a
      doctorate within three and a half years. Although he received several
      offers to join business-school faculties as an assistant professor,
      McKinnell instead elected to gain practical experience in the business
      world. He accepted his first job at American Standard, turning down an
      offer from Pfizer. After working in Brussels for two years, he accepted a
      position with Pfizer in Tokyo for what he thought would be another
      two-year period, after which he would return to academia.
    

      An early riser, McKinnell woke up between four and five in the morning and
      put in 11- to 12-hour days at the office. He lived in Manhattan and on the
      weekends went to a retreat home in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he
      enjoyed swimming, fishing, skiing, and bike-riding. An avid sportsman, he
       ran a full marathon while living in Japan and competed in four
      mini-triathlons in Greenwich.
    

      EARLY CAREER AT PFIZER: A GLOBAL FOCUS, AN UPWARD PATH
    

      When McKinnell joined Pfizer in 1971 in Tokyo, he requested sales
      training, a request that was initially puzzling to his new employer given
      his possession of a doctorate. But McKinnell brushed past the perceived
      diminutive nature of sales positions, knowing that understanding how sales
      worked would be essential to understanding a business as a whole. His
      request was granted, and he developed an appreciation for pharmaceutical
      sales, medical marketing, product development, and product
      commercialization. This knowledge, coupled with early exposure to
      international business, laid the foundation for a career at Pfizer that
      spiraled inexorably upward until McKinnell was named chief executive
      officer in 2001.
    

      After three years in Tokyo, Pfizer gave McKinnell an opportunity that was
      rare for a 30-year-old who still thought he would get back to teaching:
      the chance to run Pfizer's operations in Iran and Afghanistan,
      which comprised a fully self-contained pharmaceutical business. The
      opportunity allowed McKinnell to learn about all aspects of the
      business—sales, marketing, manufacturing, operations, and product
      development.
    

      Subsequently, McKinnell was named president of Pfizer's Asia
      Division, based in Hong Kong, until 1984. His first post in the United
      States came afterward in corporate strategic planning, where he was
      instrumental in convincing Pfizer's board of directors to alter the
      company's capital structure in order to implement a share
      repurchase program. This move was significant in that up to that time
      Pfizer had been debt-free; the new program would require that the company
      borrow in order to buy back its own shares. McKinnell effectively argued
      that the company's long-term growth prospects would more than
      offset the interest that would accrue in paying back the loan. His
      assessment proved right and successive chief financial officers continued
      the program.
    

      McKinnell continued to move quickly up the corporate ranks. He was named
      chief financial officer, his first finance job, and president of
      Pfizer's U.S. Pharmaceutical Division in 1994. By 1997 he was again
      promoted: as president of Pfizer's Global Pharmaceuticals Group,
      the company's principal operating division, he was responsible for
      worldwide pharmaceutical operations. He was executive vice president from
      1992 to 1999 and then president and chief operating officer from May 1999
      to May 2001. In January 2001 he took over the reins as chief executive
      officer from William C. Steere Jr., with whom McKinnell had worked closely
      for over a decade. By May 2001 he added the position of chairman of the
      board.
    

      Steere had ended his decade-long tenure as CEO having achieved his goal of
      making Pfizer the number one company in the world, which had come with the
      2000 merger of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. With the company having achieved
      the industry leadership position just as he entered the role of chief
      executive, McKinnell wanted to articulate a new vision that would push
      Pfizer to ever greater heights. He faced some daunting challenges: an
      industry under attack due to pricing issues, patent expirations for
      several blockbuster drugs (with sales of at least $1 billion), and growing
      calls to expand the availability of prescription drugs to the needy and
      those without insurance. McKinnell would have to apply his considerable
      executive, political, and leadership skills to address these issues.
    

      AT THE HELM OF PFIZER: NEW VISION, GREATER ACHIEVEMENTS
    

      One of McKinnell's first actions as CEO was to gather a group of
      the 25 most senior managers to define a new vision and mission for Pfizer.
      McKinnell posed a simple yet compelling question: "How do we move
      beyond number one?" With McKinnell leading, the group decided that
      Pfizer's new vision would be to hold a position as "the
      world's most valued company to patients, to customers, to business
      partners, to colleagues, and to communities where we work and live"
      (Becker, March 2002). In order to achieve this transformation, the group
      defined six areas that needed change, most of which had been addressed by
      early 2004.
    

      FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS: HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS
    

      As CEO, McKinnell continued to implement a key strategy he had been
      espousing since arriving at Pfizer's New York headquarters: to
      focus Pfizer on human pharmaceuticals by selling off noncore businesses.
      Indeed, in early 2004 human pharmaceuticals was the largest business
      segment, making up 92 percent of Pfizer revenues. At that time Pfizer
      announced plans to review some 60 noncore consumer products for possible
      sale. In 2002 and 2003 Pfizer divested itself of several of these noncore
      business units.
    

      IMPLEMENTING THE VISION THROUGH STRATEGIC MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
    

      What set Pfizer apart from the hundreds of other large corporations who
      had attempted large-scale mergers in the hopes of achieving operational
      efficiencies and increased competitiveness was that under
      McKinnell's leadership the company successfully completed not one
      but two mergers of big pharmaceutical companies. In 2000 Pfizer acquired
      Warner-Lambert, which had been marketing Lipitor, one of the
       world's most prescribed drugs of those used for lowering levels of
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol. The
      acquisition saved the combined company some $2.5 billion; the new market
      share exceeded the two companies' previous market shares combined,
      increasing from 7.8 percent to 8.2 percent.
    

      In April 2003 Pfizer completed the acquisition of Pharmacia Corporation,
      another major drug manufacturer, for $56 billion. Market share increased
      to 11 percent among world pharmaceuticals. Pfizer now had 10 drugs
      generating annual sales of $1 billion each and one drug with sales of over
      $8 billion. By 2004 Pfizer marketed eight of the world's 25
      bestselling medicines and 14 products considered leaders in their
      therapeutic categories. The company had over 130,000 employees worldwide
      and a pipeline of over two hundred projects in research and development.
    

      McKinnell sought to fill out the R&D pipeline with strategic
      acquisitions of biotechnology companies. In December 2003 Pfizer announced
      the acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, the biopharmaceutical company
      that developed therapies targeting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to treat
      cardiovascular disease. Other acquisitions were expected in 2004.
    

      DELIVERING THE NUMBERS: PFIZER'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
    

      McKinnell consistently delivered numbers that kept Wall Street analysts
      humming. In 2001 Pfizer earned revenues of $29 billion and a net income of
      $7.8 billion, up 11 percent and 109 percent over 2000, respectively. These
      numbers reflected the acquisition of Warner-Lambert. In 2002 Pfizer earned
      revenues of $32.4 billion and a net income of $9.1 billion, up 12 percent
      and 17 percent over 2001, respectively.
    

      Pfizer posted 2003 revenues of $45.2 billion, up 40 percent over
      2002—but a net income of only $3.9 billion, down 57 percent from
      2002. These numbers were reported under GAAP ("generally accepted
      accounting practices") and reflected the charges incurred as a
      result of the acquisition of Pharmacia. In financial reports Pfizer
      reconciled these GAAP numbers to numbers that took into account
      purchase-accounting rules, which required inclusion of noncash charges. In
      the adjusted numbers net income became $12.7 billion, up 28 percent over
      2002.
    

      CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
    

      Pfizer had always had a long tradition of good corporate citizenship;
      under McKinnell's leadership the tradition expanded. In 2002 Pfizer
      donated $2 million each working day through various channels. Rather than
      as an obligation, McK-innell viewed corporate philanthropy more
      synergistically, noting that "when we help patients in need, we
      enhance our standing with physicians, win respect in local communities,
      and create better working relationships with regulatory authorities. When
      we keep our people out of hospitals and enable them to function as
      productive members of society, we bolster economies and become the allies
      of governments" (Flynn, September 2003). This philosophy positioned
      Pfizer favorably; but McKinnell forthrightly acknowledged that
      Pfizer's approach was as good for profits and shareholders as for
      patients and communities.
    

      In March 2002 McKinnell was appointed by President George W. Bush to the
      Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, which was established to
      formulate recommendations on how best to ensure the highest quality
      research, prevention, and treatment for the disease. McKinnell traveled to
      African nations that had been hit particularly hard by HIV/AIDS, meeting
      with government leaders, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and
      health-care providers in order to formulate a strategy to combat the
      disease.
    

      Launched in December 2000, the Diflucan Partnership Program was initiated
      with the Government of South Africa in a public-private venture. At no
      charge health-care workers distributed Pfizer's Diflucan, a drug
      that fought two opportunistic fungal infections that together struck over
      half of African patients with full-blown AIDS. Pfizer later expanded the
      program to 12 other African countries. At the end of 2002 the program had
      distributed almost three million doses worth over $100 million and trained
      approximately 11,000 health-care professionals in the latest AIDS-care
      practices.
    

      Pfizer was the first U.S. pharmaceutical company and the largest U.S.
      company overall to sign the United Nations Global Compact, created by the
      U.N. Secretary General Kofi Anan to distribute the benefits of
      globalization across all nations.
    

      Back home McKinnell took a proactive step to control Medicaid costs in
      Florida. He contacted Governor Jeb Bush and suggested that, as
      prescription drug costs accounted for only 10 percent or $70 million of
      the state's overall Medicaid bill, some of the money could be used
      for patient education and counseling that would in turn create better
      health awareness. Pfizer carefully monitored the results of the program,
      hoping that McKinnell's unorthodox approach would create favorable
      outcomes and be duplicated in other states. On another thorny domestic
      health-care issue, McKinnell expanded the availability of prescription
      drugs to low-income seniors on Medicare. The Pfizer for Living Share Card
      provided needed medications for a flat $15 fee to qualified seniors.
    

      After the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., on September
      11, 2001, Pfizer donated medicines, health-care products, and supply
      services to those in need. Pfizer and the Pfizer Foundation pledged $10
      million to the relief effort and the company also matched approximately
      $430,000 in employee contributions. Yet another humanitarian
       effort was referred to as "Hank's Peace Corps"
      within Pfizer. Approximately 20 to 25 medically and technically trained
      people spent six months to a year working in developing countries, helping
      health-care providers, faith-based workers, and members of NGOs improve
      countries' health-care delivery services.
    

      BLENDING EAST AND WEST: AN "AGGRESSIVE CONSENSUS-SEEKING"
      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Two factors characterized McKinnell's management style: consensus
      seeking and cross-functional teamwork—both practices originating
      from his early exposure to Japanese-style management techniques.
    

      Associates at Pfizer described McKinnell as "an aggressive
      consensus seeker" at a time when many American corporations were
      run under a military-style command-and-control structure. McKinnell was a
      leader who encouraged open discussion of issues but knew how to bring
      closure to them. Deftly finding that zone of agreement where all minds
      involved could back a final decision, McKinnell effectively imported
      consensus-seeking to Pfizer.
    

      While most American companies struggled to improve internal operations by
      breaking down the barriers to communication inherent in silo-like
      functionally oriented organizations, Pfizer instead adopted a
      Japanese-style cross-functional team structure. Teams were composed of
      members of different functional areas who met together regularly over long
      periods—sometimes years—to see a product through all the
      processes of development, regulatory approval, and consumer marketing.
    

      The would-be scholar and college professor was able to cultivate a culture
      of agreement and collaboration at a time when corporate chieftains
      typically operated with a hierarchical mindset and expected subordinates
      to follow the chains of command that they had successfully climbed. That
      Hank McKinnell was able to develop this leadership style while climbing to
      the same top job as his contemporaries suggests that what worked for him
      also worked for Pfizer.
    

      Industry analysts gave positive assessments to McKinnell's
      performance at Pfizer through 2004. As he continued to promise
      double-digit returns, the company remained a Wall Street favorite.
      Referring to the two successful megamergers, one industry observer noted
      that Pfizer was in a "league of its own" (Becker, March
      2002). Another analyst noted that Pfizer was at the "peak of its
      game."
    

      Media observers covering Pfizer attempted to present McK-innell
      even-handedly. Lee Clifford of 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine described McKinnell as "polished, tall, stately, and
      stiff with a barely perceptible Canadian accent" (October 30,
      2000). John Simons, also of 
      
        Fortune
      
      , characterized him thus: "warm and avuncular one minute, exacting
      and impatient the next, McK-innell is an odd cross between Mr. Rogers and
      the cranky Dr. 'Bones' McCoy from Star Trek. In a single
      conversation, he can deliver a stirring monologue about curing the
      world's ills, then launch into a stern rant against consumer
      activists who think drug companies charge too much for their wares"
      (Boersig, October 2003).
    

      Robert L. Joss, the Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, was
      proud of one of his most successful alumni: "When we see in one of
      our alumni a person of integrity, an effective manager at the highest
      levels, and a business leader who understands that business is a social
      institution which must keep the public trust, we—as a school of
      management—want to recognize those achievements. Hank McKinnell has
      demonstrated in every way that he is a leader—as the head of the
      largest pharmaceutical company in the world, as the overseer of the
      firm's tremendous research efforts aimed at improving the human
      condition, and as a corporate citizen" (Lee, February 18, 2001).
    

      THE FIRST AMONG EQUALS: MCKINNELL'S REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND
      COMMUNITY
    

      The clearest indication of McKinnell's reputation among his peers
      was his election in 2001 as chairman emeritus of the industry's
      leading trade organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
      of America (PhRMA), a group composed of the CEOs of leading research-based
      pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In his first address McKinnell
      laid out a blueprint for a reformed health-care system in the 21st
      century. McKinnell was also chairman of PhRMA's
      Business–Higher Education Forum.
    

      After ascending to the chief executive's role, McKinnell garnered a
      series of accolades. In 2003 
      
        Institutional Investor
      
       magazine named McKinnell the top CEO in the pharmaceutical industry. He
      was also named chair of Pfizer's Executive Committee, was a member
      of the Pfizer Leadership Team, and was a director of Pfizer since June
      1997. He was a member of the influential Business Roundtable (BRT), an
      organization of business leaders; vice chairman of the BRT's
      Corporate Governance Task Force; and chairman of its SEC subcommittee.
      McKinnell sat on the boards of several companies, including ExxonMobil
      Corporation, Moody's Corporation, and John Wiley & Sons. He
      was chairman of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business
      Advisory Council and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation. McKinnell also sat on
      the boards of trustees of several organizations in New York City.
    

      Under McKinnell's leadership Pfizer's reputation rose as
      well. In February 2003 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine ranked Pfizer 14th on the list of the World's Most
      Admired Companies. In October
       2003 
      
        Med Ad News
      
      , a leading industry publication, named Pfizer the Most Admired
      Pharmaceutical Company in the industry. In March 2003 
      
        Investor Relations Magazine
      
       awarded Pfizer the Best Corporate Governance award. In 2002 the 
      
        Journal of Philanthropy
      
       named Pfizer the world's most generous company. In 2001 
      
        Fortune
      
       named Pfizer the second smartest company in America, after General
      Electric.

Henry A. McKinnell, Jr. (born February 23, 1943) is the former chief executive officer and former chairman of the board of directors of Pfizer Inc. He is also a director of Moody's.
He was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He originally worked towards a degree in chemistry but later changed his declared degree to business. He earned his bachelor's degree for business from the University of British Columbia in 1965. Later, he earned his master's and doctorate in business administration (finance subfield) from Stanford Business School.
Career[edit]
His first job offer was for Pfizer, but he instead chose to work at American Standard for three years (1969–1971). He later joined Pfizer in early 1971. Over the course of the next 32 years, McKinnell climbed his way up several positions. He was named CEO as of January 2001 and named chairman in April 2001.
In 2003 he won the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship. McKinnell was known as an aggressive and hard line advocate of trade sanctions against developing countries in disputes over patents and other intellectual property rights on medicines. In 2006, several Stanford alums asked that McKinnell be removed from an advisory board at the Stanford Business School, due to the aggressive use of litigation against the head of the Philippines regulatory agency.
Following falling share prices, McKinnell resigned the CEO position on July 28, 2006 amid dissatisfaction from the Board of Directors and declining investor confidence and was replaced by Jeff Kindler on that day. He was scheduled to remain as chairman until February 2007.[1]
Pfizer was relatively conservative with regard to mega-mergers through stock-for-stock transactions through most of its history until McKinnell took the helm in 2001. Pfizer's per share price (adjusted for splits) went from about $50 to $30 from 1999 to 2006 during McKinnell's tenure. With roughly 7 billion shares outstanding, this reflects a loss in value of 140 billion dollars under McKinnell's leadership pursuing a strategy of growth via stock for stock acquisition.
It could be argued that some of the decline in Pfizer's market value during this time could be attributed to the overall decline in blue chip stocks from 1999-2001. However, many industry analysts criticized McKinnell for diluting shareholder value with these expensive stock-for-stock acquisitions that obviously paid a premium for the underlying value of the acquired company. Furthermore, internal contributions to the pipeline did not replace declining value nor did these M&A activities. However, McKinnell received record compensation which he staunchly defended against critics.
According to documents Pfizer filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, McKinnell received a base salary in 2005 of $2,270,500, and a bonus of $3,700,000. He also received $145,814 in other compensation (primarily tax payments made by Pfizer on behalf of employees), and nearly $5.5 million in long-term incentive payouts. The value of his retirement package and deferred compensation will exceed $275,000,000.
McKinnell has, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission, donated mainly to Republican Party candidates. He has donated to George W. Bush, John Thune, Chuck Grassley, and others.

Former Pfizer CEO Henry McKinnell appointed CEO of Optimer
Replaces Pedro Lichtinger who is latest to leave amid compliance investigations

Optimer Pharmaceuticals has appointed the company's chairman and former CEO of Pfizer Dr Henry 'Hank' McKinnell to CEO.
Dr McKinnell (pictured right) will replace Pedro Lichtinger, who has been president and CEO of US biopharma Optimer since May 2010.
Lichtinger steps down as the company continues to be subject to investigations by US authorities into compliance issues.
The company's independent directors recommended a series of management changes as a result of these investigations, with previous casualties including former company chairman Michael Chang – who was replaced by Dr McKinnell in April 2012 – as well as chief financial officer John Prunty and company executive Youe-Kong Shue.
Also departing alongside Lichtinger in the latest round of changes is general counsel and chief compliance officer Kurt Hartman, who will be replaced by Meredith Schaum.
Dr McKinnell, who first joined Optimer in 2011 as a director, has a strong pedigree in pharma, serving as CEO and chair of Pfizer from 2001 to 2006.
He also currently holds the positions chairman of the board of credit ratings company Moody's Corporation and chairman of the board of the Accordia Global Health Foundation.  
Commenting on his appointment as Optimer's CEO, Dr McKinnell acknowledged the company's current compliance issues as well as the 2011 launch of the company's lead product antibiotic Dificid-Dificlir (fidaxomicin).
He said: “While the board is conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value, I look forward to working with the management team to continue to increase the utilisation of Dificid.”

Kallmann McKinnell & Wood is an architectural design firm based in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, established in 1962 as Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles by Gerhard Kallmann (1915-2012), Michael McKinnell (1935–present), and Edward Knowles.[1]

History[edit]
The firm originated when it won an international competition to design the Boston City Hall in 1962.[2] Soon reconstituted as Kallmann McKinnell and Wood, ("Kallmann, the eldest member of the team, [is] German born and English educated. ... McKinnell [is] English born and educated. ... Both have served as ... educators at the Harvard Graduate School of Design." Henry A. Wood "joined the firm in 1965."[3]) the firm would go on to design structures across the United States and abroad.
While the firm's "early period" consisted of bold structures of poured and pre-cast concrete, its later innovative work more often utilized brick, stone, copper, slate and cast stone, among other materials, for buildings that were less Brutalist in style and more postmodernist. In particular, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established KMW's new direction with a copper-roofed villa set amidst a stand of woods. The course of the firm's work through the late 1980s was charted in Alex Krieger's exhibition at Harvard's Graduate School of Design and published in the catalog that he edited, The Architecture of Kallmann McKinnell & Wood. In 2004, David Dillon's tome of the same title carried the office's work through the early 21st century.
KMW buildings have won the Harleston Parker Medal, given out for the best new building in Greater Boston, more times than any other firm in the history of the medal, as documented in the major exhibit of KMW's original drawings for Boston City Hall, from 2008. Drawn from the KMW archive in the collection of Historic New England, this exhibition was presented at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston and organized by architect Gary Wolf.[4]
Boston City Hall[edit]

The firm's design for Boston City Hall was selected after a two-stage national design competition with 256 entrants. The jury composed of major architects and three prominent Boston businessmen unanimously chose the project because of its logical and successful handling of the competition's complex building program, because of its inventive response to the urban site, and because of its powerful symbolism of a "New Boston." Boston historian Walter Muir Whitehill proclaimed the KMK design to be "as fine a building for its time and place as Boston has ever produced." Horizon Magazine lauded both the design and the competition process itself: "Boston's jury...has turned in a decisive verdict that will stand for some time as a model of responsible civic conduct."
With its concrete massing echoing in an abstract fashion not only the classical cornices of ancient Greece but also the Neo-Classical forms of Federal Boston, and with its brick base creating a continuity with the nearby masonry structures of the Blackstone Block, the building engaged the historic city in ways that the other competition entries did not.[citation needed]
Shortly after the building's opening, New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote: "Boston can celebrate with the knowledge that it has produced a superior public building in an age that values cheapness over quality as a form of public virtue. It also has one of the handsomest buildings around, and thus far, one of the least understood.... It is a product of this moment and these times.... The result is a tough and complex building for a tough and complex age, a structure of dignity, humanism, and power."[5] Public opinion has been mixed, and remains so to this day.
In breaking with the smooth, curtain-wall surfaces and the simplified forms of the then-popular post-Miesian corporate modernism, Kallmann, McKinnell and Knowles' design asserted the civic presence of City Hall on the large surrounding plaza. McKinnell spoke of how concrete allowed architects to return to early modernist principles of truthful expression of structure and materials, while reacting critically to the corporate architectural establishment of the time. "After we won the City Hall competition, we were walking along Madison Avenue, and we spied [Philip] Johnson coming towards us, waving his arms in typical Johnsonian fashion. 'Ah! I'm so happy for you two young boys who have won this competition. Absolutely marvelous. I think it's wonderful. And it's so ugly!' We thought that was the greatest praise we could get."[6]
City Hall was published internationally both at the time of its design and upon its completion, and popular publications and tourist guide books featured the building prominently. Just as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and Sydney's Opera House—also products of widely-publicized design competitions—focused attention on their respective cities, Boston City Hall became associated with the city's successful reinvention of itself following decades of decline. While the building has remained controversial, both its now-historic symbolic role, and its location at the heart of a governmental district that dates back nearly 400 years, make the argument for City Hall's continued importance. Said McKinnell: "As we all know, Boston's mayor wants to sell or preferably tear down City Hall. But as [structural engineer] Bill LeMessurier once said, it will take a controlled nuclear device to get rid of this building. So in a very real way, perhaps, we have made our legacy using concrete because it is so bloody difficult to get rid of.... We were right in the sense that architecture had to be rethought as something which is long-lived and, over time, could be decorated, embellished, and adorned by subsequent generations."[7]
As of March 2011, plans are underway to re-think the surrounding plaza in relation to the building.[8][9]

American Academy of Arts and Sciences Building


After being established to see Boston City Hall through to completion, Kallmann McKinnell & Wood continued to design major buildings in Boston, throughout New England, and world-wide. Locally, its many buildings range from Newton, with the City's Public Library, to Boston's Columbia Point, with the University of Massachusetts Boston Campus Center. In New Jersey, the Becton Dickinson corporate headquarters can be found. In Bangkok, there is the U. S. Embassy. The Krieger and Dillon volumes provide comprehensive overviews of the firm's work.

■ Dr. Henry A. McKinnell Jr. became chief executive officer of Pfizer in January 2001 and chairman of the board in April 2001 after holding a series of senior executive positions spanning more than 32 years with the company. During his time at Pfizer, McKinnell helped turn the company from a leader in the pharmaceutical industry into a "transforming force" with the acquisitions of Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Pharmacia in 2003 and the subsequent successful integration of both firms, forming a behemoth that earned $45 billion in 2003. Observers described McKinnell as polished, stately, and avuncular, yet also exacting, passionate, and sometimes impatient. A deeply moral man, McKinnell expanded Pfizer's philanthropic activities both in the United States and in the developing world.
PERSONAL BACKGROUND


McKinnell was a third-generation Canadian brought up in Vancouver, British Columbia. He went to a Christian Brothers school through the eighth grade, an experience that imbued him with a strong moral code. His father owned and operated cargo vessels; during his teen years and through college he spent school vacations working on his father's ships as a deck-hand and first mate. He gained a penchant for racing Austin Healey sports cars in events sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America and spent two summers racing many West Coast tracks, from Vancouver to Los Angeles.
He enrolled at the University of British Columbia intending to major in chemical engineering and eventually become a college professor. He described himself as an average student with a greater focus on extracurricular activities than academics during the first half of his five-year stint at the university. He then married and decided to "get serious," switching his major to business administration and finishing second in his class.
Based on his achievement McKinnell received a $10,000-a-year fellowship to the Stanford Business School, a tidy sum at that time—it was in fact more money than most full-time jobs offered. He accepted and earned a doctorate within three and a half years. Although he received several offers to join business-school faculties as an assistant professor, McKinnell instead elected to gain practical experience in the business world. He accepted his first job at American Standard, turning down an offer from Pfizer. After working in Brussels for two years, he accepted a position with Pfizer in Tokyo for what he thought would be another two-year period, after which he would return to academia.
An early riser, McKinnell woke up between four and five in the morning and put in 11- to 12-hour days at the office. He lived in Manhattan and on the weekends went to a retreat home in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he enjoyed swimming, fishing, skiing, and bike-riding. An avid sportsman, he ran a full marathon while living in Japan and competed in four mini-triathlons in Greenwich.
EARLY CAREER AT PFIZER: A GLOBAL FOCUS, AN UPWARD PATH
When McKinnell joined Pfizer in 1971 in Tokyo, he requested sales training, a request that was initially puzzling to his new employer given his possession of a doctorate. But McKinnell brushed past the perceived diminutive nature of sales positions, knowing that understanding how sales worked would be essential to understanding a business as a whole. His request was granted, and he developed an appreciation for pharmaceutical sales, medical marketing, product development, and product commercialization. This knowledge, coupled with early exposure to international business, laid the foundation for a career at Pfizer that spiraled inexorably upward until McKinnell was named chief executive officer in 2001.
After three years in Tokyo, Pfizer gave McKinnell an opportunity that was rare for a 30-year-old who still thought he would get back to teaching: the chance to run Pfizer's operations in Iran and Afghanistan, which comprised a fully self-contained pharmaceutical business. The opportunity allowed McKinnell to learn about all aspects of the business—sales, marketing, manufacturing, operations, and product development.
Subsequently, McKinnell was named president of Pfizer's Asia Division, based in Hong Kong, until 1984. His first post in the United States came afterward in corporate strategic planning, where he was instrumental in convincing Pfizer's board of directors to alter the company's capital structure in order to implement a share repurchase program. This move was significant in that up to that time Pfizer had been debt-free; the new program would require that the company borrow in order to buy back its own shares. McKinnell effectively argued that the company's long-term growth prospects would more than offset the interest that would accrue in paying back the loan. His assessment proved right and successive chief financial officers continued the program.
McKinnell continued to move quickly up the corporate ranks. He was named chief financial officer, his first finance job, and president of Pfizer's U.S. Pharmaceutical Division in 1994. By 1997 he was again promoted: as president of Pfizer's Global Pharmaceuticals Group, the company's principal operating division, he was responsible for worldwide pharmaceutical operations. He was executive vice president from 1992 to 1999 and then president and chief operating officer from May 1999 to May 2001. In January 2001 he took over the reins as chief executive officer from William C. Steere Jr., with whom McKinnell had worked closely for over a decade. By May 2001 he added the position of chairman of the board.
Steere had ended his decade-long tenure as CEO having achieved his goal of making Pfizer the number one company in the world, which had come with the 2000 merger of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. With the company having achieved the industry leadership position just as he entered the role of chief executive, McKinnell wanted to articulate a new vision that would push Pfizer to ever greater heights. He faced some daunting challenges: an industry under attack due to pricing issues, patent expirations for several blockbuster drugs (with sales of at least $1 billion), and growing calls to expand the availability of prescription drugs to the needy and those without insurance. McKinnell would have to apply his considerable executive, political, and leadership skills to address these issues.
AT THE HELM OF PFIZER: NEW VISION, GREATER ACHIEVEMENTS


One of McKinnell's first actions as CEO was to gather a group of the 25 most senior managers to define a new vision and mission for Pfizer. McKinnell posed a simple yet compelling question: "How do we move beyond number one?" With McKinnell leading, the group decided that Pfizer's new vision would be to hold a position as "the world's most valued company to patients, to customers, to business partners, to colleagues, and to communities where we work and live" (Becker, March 2002). In order to achieve this transformation, the group defined six areas that needed change, most of which had been addressed by early 2004.
FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS: HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS
As CEO, McKinnell continued to implement a key strategy he had been espousing since arriving at Pfizer's New York headquarters: to focus Pfizer on human pharmaceuticals by selling off noncore businesses. Indeed, in early 2004 human pharmaceuticals was the largest business segment, making up 92 percent of Pfizer revenues. At that time Pfizer announced plans to review some 60 noncore consumer products for possible sale. In 2002 and 2003 Pfizer divested itself of several of these noncore business units.
IMPLEMENTING THE VISION THROUGH STRATEGIC MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
What set Pfizer apart from the hundreds of other large corporations who had attempted large-scale mergers in the hopes of achieving operational efficiencies and increased competitiveness was that under McKinnell's leadership the company successfully completed not one but two mergers of big pharmaceutical companies. In 2000 Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, which had been marketing Lipitor, one of the world's most prescribed drugs of those used for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol. The acquisition saved the combined company some $2.5 billion; the new market share exceeded the two companies' previous market shares combined, increasing from 7.8 percent to 8.2 percent.
In April 2003 Pfizer completed the acquisition of Pharmacia Corporation, another major drug manufacturer, for $56 billion. Market share increased to 11 percent among world pharmaceuticals. Pfizer now had 10 drugs generating annual sales of $1 billion each and one drug with sales of over $8 billion. By 2004 Pfizer marketed eight of the world's 25 bestselling medicines and 14 products considered leaders in their therapeutic categories. The company had over 130,000 employees worldwide and a pipeline of over two hundred projects in research and development.
McKinnell sought to fill out the R&D pipeline with strategic acquisitions of biotechnology companies. In December 2003 Pfizer announced the acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, the biopharmaceutical company that developed therapies targeting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to treat cardiovascular disease. Other acquisitions were expected in 2004.
DELIVERING THE NUMBERS: PFIZER'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
McKinnell consistently delivered numbers that kept Wall Street analysts humming. In 2001 Pfizer earned revenues of $29 billion and a net income of $7.8 billion, up 11 percent and 109 percent over 2000, respectively. These numbers reflected the acquisition of Warner-Lambert. In 2002 Pfizer earned revenues of $32.4 billion and a net income of $9.1 billion, up 12 percent and 17 percent over 2001, respectively.
Pfizer posted 2003 revenues of $45.2 billion, up 40 percent over 2002—but a net income of only $3.9 billion, down 57 percent from 2002. These numbers were reported under GAAP ("generally accepted accounting practices") and reflected the charges incurred as a result of the acquisition of Pharmacia. In financial reports Pfizer reconciled these GAAP numbers to numbers that took into account purchase-accounting rules, which required inclusion of noncash charges. In the adjusted numbers net income became $12.7 billion, up 28 percent over 2002.
CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Pfizer had always had a long tradition of good corporate citizenship; under McKinnell's leadership the tradition expanded. In 2002 Pfizer donated $2 million each working day through various channels. Rather than as an obligation, McK-innell viewed corporate philanthropy more synergistically, noting that "when we help patients in need, we enhance our standing with physicians, win respect in local communities, and create better working relationships with regulatory authorities. When we keep our people out of hospitals and enable them to function as productive members of society, we bolster economies and become the allies of governments" (Flynn, September 2003). This philosophy positioned Pfizer favorably; but McKinnell forthrightly acknowledged that Pfizer's approach was as good for profits and shareholders as for patients and communities.
In March 2002 McKinnell was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, which was established to formulate recommendations on how best to ensure the highest quality research, prevention, and treatment for the disease. McKinnell traveled to African nations that had been hit particularly hard by HIV/AIDS, meeting with government leaders, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and health-care providers in order to formulate a strategy to combat the disease.


Launched in December 2000, the Diflucan Partnership Program was initiated with the Government of South Africa in a public-private venture. At no charge health-care workers distributed Pfizer's Diflucan, a drug that fought two opportunistic fungal infections that together struck over half of African patients with full-blown AIDS. Pfizer later expanded the program to 12 other African countries. At the end of 2002 the program had distributed almost three million doses worth over $100 million and trained approximately 11,000 health-care professionals in the latest AIDS-care practices.
Pfizer was the first U.S. pharmaceutical company and the largest U.S. company overall to sign the United Nations Global Compact, created by the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Anan to distribute the benefits of globalization across all nations.
Back home McKinnell took a proactive step to control Medicaid costs in Florida. He contacted Governor Jeb Bush and suggested that, as prescription drug costs accounted for only 10 percent or $70 million of the state's overall Medicaid bill, some of the money could be used for patient education and counseling that would in turn create better health awareness. Pfizer carefully monitored the results of the program, hoping that McKinnell's unorthodox approach would create favorable outcomes and be duplicated in other states. On another thorny domestic health-care issue, McKinnell expanded the availability of prescription drugs to low-income seniors on Medicare. The Pfizer for Living Share Card provided needed medications for a flat $15 fee to qualified seniors.
After the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001, Pfizer donated medicines, health-care products, and supply services to those in need. Pfizer and the Pfizer Foundation pledged $10 million to the relief effort and the company also matched approximately $430,000 in employee contributions. Yet another humanitarian effort was referred to as "Hank's Peace Corps" within Pfizer. Approximately 20 to 25 medically and technically trained people spent six months to a year working in developing countries, helping health-care providers, faith-based workers, and members of NGOs improve countries' health-care delivery services.
BLENDING EAST AND WEST: AN "AGGRESSIVE CONSENSUS-SEEKING" MANAGEMENT STYLE
Two factors characterized McKinnell's management style: consensus seeking and cross-functional teamwork—both practices originating from his early exposure to Japanese-style management techniques.
Associates at Pfizer described McKinnell as "an aggressive consensus seeker" at a time when many American corporations were run under a military-style command-and-control structure. McKinnell was a leader who encouraged open discussion of issues but knew how to bring closure to them. Deftly finding that zone of agreement where all minds involved could back a final decision, McKinnell effectively imported consensus-seeking to Pfizer.
While most American companies struggled to improve internal operations by breaking down the barriers to communication inherent in silo-like functionally oriented organizations, Pfizer instead adopted a Japanese-style cross-functional team structure. Teams were composed of members of different functional areas who met together regularly over long periods—sometimes years—to see a product through all the processes of development, regulatory approval, and consumer marketing.
The would-be scholar and college professor was able to cultivate a culture of agreement and collaboration at a time when corporate chieftains typically operated with a hierarchical mindset and expected subordinates to follow the chains of command that they had successfully climbed. That Hank McKinnell was able to develop this leadership style while climbing to the same top job as his contemporaries suggests that what worked for him also worked for Pfizer.
Industry analysts gave positive assessments to McKinnell's performance at Pfizer through 2004. As he continued to promise double-digit returns, the company remained a Wall Street favorite. Referring to the two successful megamergers, one industry observer noted that Pfizer was in a "league of its own" (Becker, March 2002). Another analyst noted that Pfizer was at the "peak of its game."


Media observers covering Pfizer attempted to present McK-innell even-handedly. Lee Clifford of Fortune magazine described McKinnell as "polished, tall, stately, and stiff with a barely perceptible Canadian accent" (October 30, 2000). John Simons, also of Fortune, characterized him thus: "warm and avuncular one minute, exacting and impatient the next, McK-innell is an odd cross between Mr. Rogers and the cranky Dr. 'Bones' McCoy from Star Trek. In a single conversation, he can deliver a stirring monologue about curing the world's ills, then launch into a stern rant against consumer activists who think drug companies charge too much for their wares" (Boersig, October 2003).
Robert L. Joss, the Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, was proud of one of his most successful alumni: "When we see in one of our alumni a person of integrity, an effective manager at the highest levels, and a business leader who understands that business is a social institution which must keep the public trust, we—as a school of management—want to recognize those achievements. Hank McKinnell has demonstrated in every way that he is a leader—as the head of the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, as the overseer of the firm's tremendous research efforts aimed at improving the human condition, and as a corporate citizen" (Lee, February 18, 2001).
THE FIRST AMONG EQUALS: MCKINNELL'S REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY
The clearest indication of McKinnell's reputation among his peers was his election in 2001 as chairman emeritus of the industry's leading trade organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a group composed of the CEOs of leading research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In his first address McKinnell laid out a blueprint for a reformed health-care system in the 21st century. McKinnell was also chairman of PhRMA's Business–Higher Education Forum.
After ascending to the chief executive's role, McKinnell garnered a series of accolades. In 2003 Institutional Investor magazine named McKinnell the top CEO in the pharmaceutical industry. He was also named chair of Pfizer's Executive Committee, was a member of the Pfizer Leadership Team, and was a director of Pfizer since June 1997. He was a member of the influential Business Roundtable (BRT), an organization of business leaders; vice chairman of the BRT's Corporate Governance Task Force; and chairman of its SEC subcommittee. McKinnell sat on the boards of several companies, including ExxonMobil Corporation, Moody's Corporation, and John Wiley & Sons. He was chairman of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Advisory Council and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation. McKinnell also sat on the boards of trustees of several organizations in New York City.
Under McKinnell's leadership Pfizer's reputation rose as well. In February 2003 Fortune magazine ranked Pfizer 14th on the list of the World's Most Admired Companies. In October 2003 Med Ad News, a leading industry publication, named Pfizer the Most Admired Pharmaceutical Company in the industry. In March 2003 Investor Relations Magazine awarded Pfizer the Best Corporate Governance award. In 2002 the Journal of Philanthropy named Pfizer the world's most generous company. In 2001 Fortune named Pfizer the second smartest company in America, after General Electric.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
