All Your Accounts, All in One Place



The Personal Capital dashboard works with all of your financial accounts - from your checking and savings accounts to your investment and IRA accounts to your mortgage, home equity loans and credit cards to give a complete picture of your net worth, any time, on any device.








As of April 2016, Betterment added data aggregation pulling in information on all types of client accounts. You must be a client in order to access Betterment's tools.





No ability to view all accounts in Fidelity Go. Does not have mobile app.








No ability to view all accounts in Schwab’s mobile app and website.





No ability to view all accounts in Vanguard's mobile app and website.





As of April 2016, Wealthfront added data aggregation pulling in information on all types of client accounts.






Dedicated Financial Advisors



You get personal attention from two dedicated financial planners who will develop a lifelong financial strategy tailored to your needs. The result is a complete transformation in the way you understand, manage and grow your net worth.








No advisors.





No advisors.



Licensed advisors on staff and available.


No dedicated advisor, you have access to a call center where you can speak to an advisor by chat or phone.




You are assigned one dedicated financial advisor. Personal Capital gives you two.





No advisors.






Personalized Investment Strategy



Our asset allocation decisions and portfolio construction is driven by your personalized data and specific cash flow needs, not a simple algorithm based on a few questions. This ensures a truly customized strategy just for your specific situation and not a “cookie-cutter” solution.








Portfolios selected based on short questionnaire. No way to adjust or customize.





Portfolios selected based on short questionnaire. No way to adjust or customize.





Portfolios selected based on short questionnaire. No way to adjust or customize.





Portfolios selected based on short questionnaire. No way to adjust or customize.





Limited Investment Strategy. Portfolios are created by advisors on an individual basis. Core holdings are Admiral Shares of Vanguard index funds. ETFs and active funds are incorporated if needed.





Portfolios selected based on short questionnaire.  No way to adjust or customize.






No Conflicts of Interest



As fiduciaries, our advisors are legally bound to act in your best interest and will never put their personal financial gain above yours. Advisors associated with broker dealer firms are often incentivized to recommend high margin investments.











Portfolio funds are either proprietary Fidelity products or third party funds with a financial arrangement and potential conflict of interest.











Portfolio funds are either proprietary Schwab products or third party funds with a financial arrangement and potential conflict of interest.





Vanguard Personal Advisor Services primarily uses Vanguard funds. However, Vanguard funds carry some of the lowest expense ratios available.









Advice On Your Full Financial Picture



Using the Personal Capital dashboard, we build your portfolio across all of your accounts, placing each security in the optimal tax status account. We will review all of your accounts, even those not under our management – to give you the best advice for your financial portfolio.








Financial planning related to retirement planning only.





You can only view the assets you have invested at Fidelity.








You can only view the assets you have invested at Schwab.





Similar to Personal Capital, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services looks at accounts not directly managed by Vanguard when developing your financial plan.





Wealthfront's algorithm focuses on fees and access cash in your account, based on investing best practices. However, they have a very limited scope on what they do for your full financial picture.






Smart Indexing



We advocate an evenly weighted approach to sectors and styles in US stocks. This provides extra return and reduced risk from sector “bubbles” for our clients.








Portfolios focus heavily on value stocks with increased sector concentrations and unnecessary portfolio volatility.





Only offers low indexing with Fidelity Funds.





Limited Smart Indexing





Schwab Intelligent Portfolios mandate between 6-30% of the portfolio be in cash (far above what Modern Portfolio Theory recommends). Oversized cash allocation can cost you significant real wealth over time.



Limited Smart Indexing. Portfolios are rebalanced once per quarter.




Portfolios focus heavily on value stocks which have increased sector concentrations and unnecessary portfolio volatility.






Fully Customizable Portfolios



Our solutions are highly personalized to you.  We can add specific securities or eliminate securities you don’t want,  adjust allocations based on specific circumstance, and build you an investment plan that is both cost- and tax-efficient.








No adjustments or customizations.





Limited Customizable Portfolios





Limited Customizable Portfolios

How We Protect Your Security


At Personal Capital our highest priority is keeping your 
					financial data safe and secure. Your data is stored at a PCI-compliant 
					data center that uses the same secure AES 256-bit encryption in use at 
					major banks and financial institutions worldwide. We perform regular 3rd
					 party security audits, and use RSA, Verisign and other industry state 
					of the art security solutions and practices to protect our site.
Electronic and procedural safeguards include the use of a 
					unique user name and a password. For an extra measure of security we include device 
					authentication that controls who can access your account, and on what 
					device. Each and every device that links to your account is first 
					authenticated by you, either with a phone call or by email. Before you 
					can access your account on a new computer, tablet, or smart phone, 
					you'll receive an automated phone call or email asking to confirm your 
					identity, and approve the new device.
