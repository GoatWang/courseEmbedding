        Mr. James replaces Greg McCann who is retiring as Chairman also effective today. Mr. McCann joined the board in April 2007 and as Chairman has guided the company's IPO and listing on the ASX, and its entry into the US market.
        MOKO CEO Shripal Shah said that he has appreciated the support from Mr. McCann and thanked him for his nine years of service to MOKO. "Greg has been a steadying influence and has provided me with sound advice. I will miss his contribution."
        Mr. James is a highly experienced public company Non-Executive Chairman and currently is Non-Executive Chairman of Algae.Tec Ltd and Anova Metals Ltd and a Non-Executive Director of Vimy Resources Ltd.

        MOKO chairman Greg McCann said, "We are delighted to welcome both Mal and Jim to the board of MOKO Social Media. Mal is an experienced public company Chairman and Jim's extensive experience in US sports marketing and proven record in driving increased revenues, is highly valued. We look forward to their guidance and leadership as MOKO enters the next stage of its growth. We believe their experience and networks will be a great asset in the current review of strategic options for the future of the company, a process in which advisor District Capital Partners is assisting."
        MOKO today also reported further strong growth in take-up of its leading REC*IT app, into the new US academic year (2016-17) with over 889,000 total first launches for REC*IT as of 6th October 2016. In the period from the 1st of August 2016 until the 30th of September 2016 REC*IT has achieved the following:
        

            154,000   First Launches -- demonstrating a 43% increase from the same period last year 
        



            241,000   Unique Visitors -- demonstrating a 65% increase from the same period last year 
        



            13 screens viewed per session -- demonstrating a 33% increase from the same period last year 
        

        MOKO CEO Shripal Shah said, "The ongoing strong take-up of REC*IT confirms our product is widely engaging the US student market.
        "Our aim now is to leverage our leading position to drive sales and revenue growth. The appointment of Mal and Jim is perfectly timed to help us take our business to the next level. Their experience and network will assist us in forging new brand partnerships."

        Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements
        This press release contains information that may constitute forward-looking statements and uses forward-looking terminology such as "anticipate" "propose" "expect" and "will," negatives of such terms or other similar statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement due to its inherent risk and uncertainties, both general and specific.
        Although we believe the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable and within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations as of the date hereof, any or all of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate. Risk factors that could contribute to such differences include our ability to prepare required documents in connection with the proposed offering, the timing of regulatory review, performance of our shares on the OTC Market, and the performance of the United States and global capital markets and companies in our sector, as well as factors relating to the performance of our business, including intense competition we face; failure to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users; our ongoing need for capital for investment in new and existing business strategies and new products, services and technologies, including through acquisitions; our dependence on advertising revenues; the potential for declines in our revenue growth rate and downward pressure on our operating margin in the future; increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business; legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes; failure to maintain and enhance our brand; uncertainty as to our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; and uncertainty as to our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and personnel. The forward-looking information provided herein represents the Company's estimates as of the date of the press release, and subsequent events and developments may cause the Company's estimates to change. The Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking information in the future. Therefore, this forward-looking information should not be relied upon as representing the Company's estimates of its future intentions as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Our plans may differ materially from information contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risk factors or others, as well as changes in plans from our board of directors and management.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
