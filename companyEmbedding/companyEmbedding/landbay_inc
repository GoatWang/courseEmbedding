Company overview[edit]
Landbay enables retail and institutional investors to invest in the UK's buy-to-let mortgage market via its online peer-to-peer lending platform. The business model matches investors' funds to buy-to-let mortgages, thus all loans are secured by residential real estate. [3][4]
As at February 2015 Landbay is the fastest growing peer-to-peer platform in the United Kingdom[5] and as of March 2015 the business was lending £2m per month.
The company was founded by John Goodall and Gray Stern.[6][7]
In March 2015 the business was named in the Everline Future 50 as one of the most disruptive startups in the UK.[8]
Landbay is a member of the P2P Finance Association. The Association also includes other established P2P lenders in UK financial market such as Zopa, Funding Circle, and RateSetter.[9] Landbay is also a member of the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
The company is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Peer-to-Peer Lending[edit]
Peer-to-peer lending is the practice of lending money to unrelated individuals or businesses, “peers”, without going through traditional financial intermediaries like banks. Landbay is a peer-to-peer platform: the online exchange that manages the entire lending process, allowing users to lend money across multiple properties in return for an interest payment each month.[10][11]
